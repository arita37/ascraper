```
I'm trying to get titles of accepted papers in some conferences like ICML, NeurIPS and CVPR. For that, I'm using openrev
iew api (python package). But the problem with that is it doesn't work for NeurIPS 2023, ICML 2023. Also, openreview web
site doesn't has 2023 CVPR reviews (Though, 2023 being first time CVPR is using openreview). Is there anything I'm not f
amiliar in case of CVPR 2023? However, similar code works for NeurIPS's previous years with change being only the years 
but not for ICML.

    client = openreview.Client(baseurl='https://api.openreview.net') venue_group = client.get_group('
NeurIPS.cc/2023/Conference') submissions = client.get_all_notes(content={'venueid':'NeurIPS.cc/2023/Conference'} ) submi
ssions 

Above code gives an empty list for both NeurIPS and ICML. Above code gives Group Not Found when conference name
 is replaced with CVPR.

Any help is highly appreciated.

all -  [ [Education] Chances of getting into a top MS biostats despite a poor junior year due to medical prob ](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/18oqvhx/education_chances_of_getting_into_a_top_ms/) , 2023-12-26-0909
```
Current senior applying to Biostatistics, CSE, and Applied Math MS programs. I go to a top 20 US school known for being 
rigorous in math and stats, and I’m majoring in applied math with minors in stats and CS. In my junior year, I had a 3.0
0 and 3.58 each semester, including C+’s in probability theory and DS&A and a B in complex analysis, and 2 W’s (which do
n’t count towards my GPA). This is because I went to the hospital twice for medical emergencies, all of which is detaile
d in my extenuating circumstances statement.

I finished this semester with a 3.94, including A’s in graduate level Func
tional Analysis, Stochastic Processes, and Regression. This brought my cumulative GPA back to 3.71  and major GPA to 3.6
2. However, I am very concerned because a few of the classes I did poorly in are core classes. 

Here is the rest of my 
application:
Research experience: ~9 months research with a prof in Stats/ML eventually resulting in a co-authored paper
 accepted to a Workshop at NeurIPS 2023, 4 months with a prof in Math Bio/Dynamics resulting in a poster session. 

Work
 experience: summer internship at prestigious bank as a data scientist (Used python, SQL, and R and got a return offer),
 tennis coaching, math tutoring at my school (calculus, lin alg, diffeq), Calc 3 teaching assistant, startup co-founder 
with over $400k raised (oversee around 10 employees, maybe this could signal leadership lol)

Extracurriculars: voluntee
ring at math outreach program at my school, math club, biology club

LORs: First research advisor (10/10, he told me pre
tty much what he would be writing), math  Professor (great guy in general and knew him pretty well, but still can’t be t
oo certain), Other research advisor (Probably will be pretty good, got to know her and her research pretty well)

Prereq
uisites and relevant classes: Got an A in honors linear algebra but B+ in honors analysis on multiple variables, which i
s my rigorous substitution for a Calc 3 class. Other relevant coursework includes honors real analysis (A), discrete Mat
h (B+), nonlinear dynamics (B+), and the classes I mentioned above.

My research interests/projects do align well with t
he professors I’ve talked about on my SOPs so far. Maybe this will be useful. It might also be worth noting that my hosp
ital visits actually highlighted a key medical application of my research paper, which I talked about in my SOP.

The pr
ograms I am applying to are 
* Harvard CSE ME
* Harvard Biostatistics SM-80
* CMU computational biology
* Columbia appli
ed math
* Brown biostats
* Uchicago Statistics
* Uchicago Computational and applied math
* Stanford Computational and Ma
thematical engineering
* Upenn applied math and computational science
* Upenn scientific computing

Thanks for any advic
e!

all -  [ Proposing a Mathematical Reasoning Model Inspired by GARs ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/18myeqb/proposing_a_mathematical_reasoning_model_inspired/) , 2023-12-26-0909
```
While GARs are primarily designed for language tasks, their core principles of adversarial training and reservoir dynami
cs could potentially be adapted for mathematical reasoning and symbolic manipulation. Here's a proposed framework:

1. M
athematical Reservoirs:

Construct two reservoir networks: a generator and a discriminator.
Nodes in the reservoir repre
sent mathematical entities (numbers, symbols, operators, functions).
Edges represent relationships and operations betwee
n entities.
Reservoir dynamics model the evolution of mathematical states and expressions.

2. Input Encoding:

Represen
t mathematical expressions as structured input sequences (e.g., using tree-like structures or graph representations).
Tr
anslate these structures into activation patterns within the reservoir networks.

3. Adversarial Training:

Generator: C
reate new mathematical expressions or symbolic manipulations.
Discriminator: Evaluate validity, consistency, and adheren
ce to mathematical rules.
Both networks compete and co-evolve, driving each other towards improved capabilities.

4. Rea
dout Layers:

Extract meaningful information from reservoir states.
Generate outputs like:
Solved equations.
Proven theo
rems.
Discovered patterns.
Creative mathematical insights.

5. Dataset and Training:

Compile a large corpus of mathemat
ical examples, theorems, proofs, and problems.
Train the model using both supervised learning (with known solutions) and
 reinforcement learning (with rewards for successful problem-solving).

Potential Challenges and Considerations:

Encodi
ng Mathematical Structures: Effectively representing complex mathematical relationships within reservoir networks is a s
ignificant challenge.

Interpretability: Understanding the model's reasoning process and extracting meaningful insights 
from reservoir dynamics is crucial for validation and trust.

Generalization: Ensuring the model can generalize to unsee
n mathematical problems and domains is essential for real-world applications.
Integration with Traditional Mathematical 
Tools: Combining GAR-inspired models with symbolic computation systems and theorem provers could bridge symbolic and sub
symbolic reasoning approaches.

This proposal is highly speculative and requires substantial research to evaluate its fe
asibility and effectiveness. However, it offers a thought-provoking approach to bridge language-centric AI techniques wi
th the realm of mathematics, potentially opening new avenues for machine-assisted mathematical reasoning and discovery.

Hola,

For those who attended NeurIPS: I'm curious what your takeaways and learnings were!

I can share some of mine, sp
ecific to my background (I sent this to my PhD supervisor afterwards):

 1. VL reasoning or text to image wasn't a major
 topic but diffusion generally, more often from a vision perspective, was. But so few topics are major at NeurIPS since 
it's so big
2. Retrieval augmented image generation is a cool idea, intuitively - let's see how it will work in the futu
re. Especially for learning better semantics it could be very useful
3. Due to the amount of people but also ratio (firs
t authors/all attendees), almost no poster presenter was sad because nobody stopped by. It felt like there's a lot of in
terest for every poster.
4. Organizing a workshop is really fulfilling.
5. Talked to a lot of people who do good rigorou
s science and value that above fast success via publishing a lot. Who inspired me in that regard, also via the panel we 
had on Slow Science in the New In Machine Learning Workshop.
6. We are hopefully moving away more from anthropomorphizin
g LLMs and AI generally: papers like the Generative AI paradox (by AI2). It's still happening a lot though.

The NeurIPS 2023 con
ference concluded with Cohere For AI's focus on Aya, an open science research project aimed at advancing multilingual pr
ogress in large language models. A video explaining Aya's workings was shared by the C4AI team[1]. Cohere also developed
 Embed v3, a model designed to address noisy data in modern search systems, aiming to identify high-value content and re
duce computing costs[2].







Yann LeCun, Meta's Chief AI Scientist, discussed the open sourcing culture at Facebook, 
contrasting it with his experiences at other companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple. He also highlighted th
e difficulties he faced when trying to open source projects at AT&T[3]. LeCun was interviewed on CBS Saturday Morning, d
iscussing the present and future of AI, including its benefits and risks[7]. He also shared a segment on CBS about Meta'
s Fundamental AI Research lab (FAIR) for its 10th anniversary, discussing the importance of open research, the risks and
 benefits of AI, the future of AI, and the potential of AI assistants and domestic robots[11].







The author clarifi
ed that open source AI did not begin with Llama or PyTorch[4]. The history of Torch and PyTorch was detailed, starting w
ith Ronan developing Torch3 during his PhD at IDIAP, and ending with the creation of PyTorch by engineers at Facebook[9]
. PyTorch was inspired by Torch7, developed at NEC Labs and NYU, and supported dynamic graphs from the beginning, which 
Torch7 couldn't do[14].







Two of the co-founders of Mistral did their PhD and worked as research scientists at FAIR
-Paris before founding Mistral, where they were exposed to the open research culture at FAIR[5]. FAIR sites are located 
in various cities including Paris, London, Tel Aviv, New York, Montreal, Menlo Park, Seattle, and Pittsburgh[13].








The author argued that planning-based methods using trained world models would be the winning combination for AI, but f
or simple kinematics/dynamics and relatively simple grasping tasks, trainable world models are unnecessary[6]. The emerg
ence of superhuman AI will be a progressive process, starting with systems that can learn about the world like baby anim
als and gradually scaling up to be as smart as a dog or crow[15]. The author also stated that AI is smarter than humans 
because it can beat them at games like chess, go, and poker[12].







The umbrella AI R&D organization, Meta AI, which
 included FAIR and engineering divisions, has undergone changes. The AI engineering organizations have been moved closer
 to product groups, resulting in the disappearance of Meta AI as an organization. However, Meta AI now refers to Meta's 
AI assistant accessible through Messenger and WhatsApp[8].







Marc Andreessen, a prominent technology investor and e
ntrepreneur, argues that regulating artificial intelligence (AI) is the basis for a new form of totalitarianism[16]. He 
also shared a link to an article about the Wuhan Institute of Virology and its use of artificial intelligence[17].

Cohere is hosting a live demo session featuring the winners of the Coral hackathon, showcasing a c
hatbot app called Chat with RAG that connects to health data points, scans nutrition labels, and provides dietary recomm
endations based on user's goals [1]. Cohere now officially supports both JavaScript and TypeScript, with a short video p
rovided to help users get started [2]. In collaboration with Buildwithfern, Cohere is creating an always-up-to-date and 
well-documented TypeScript SDK, currently in beta, that provides access to the Cohere API from JavaScript/TypeScript and
 supports streaming endpoints [3]. Cohere is also highlighting a maker spotlight on BYTE [4]. As the NeurIPS2023 confere
nce concludes, Cohere For AI Vice President Sarah Ooker and Research Scientist Ahmet Üstün will discuss the mission and 
research goals of the C4AI lab [5].







NVIDIA AI Developer introduces FoundationPose, a unified model for 6D object 
pose estimation and tracking for novel objects [6]. This framework supports both model-based and model-free setups and o
utperforms prior work designed specifically for these tasks [7]. The model is applied to each object without any fine-tu
ning, and the result is comparable to the ground truth throughout the video [8]. NVIDIA AI Developer set a new benchmark
 record for the 'model-based pose estimation' task in the BOP challenge, which has implications for fields such as robot
ics and augmented reality [9]. The foundation model is scalable and can be quickly deployed to different objects, highli
ghting the importance of high-precision pose and tracking for robotic manipulation in tasks that require higher precisio
n [10]. Smooth and accurate pose tracking is also important in enabling high-fidelity physics simulation for an improved
 augmented reality (AR) gaming experience [11].







The latest annual McKinsey Global Survey on the state of AI revea
ls that one-third of organizations are using generative AI tools regularly in at least one business function. AI has bec
ome a focus for company leaders, with C-suite executives personally using gen AI tools for work. However, many organizat
ions are not fully prepared for the risks associated with gen AI, with less than half of respondents saying their organi
zations are mitigating the risk of inaccuracy [15].







Auto-Regressive Language Models (AR-LLMs) are useful for conv
erting abstract ideas into sequences of tokens, such as words, actions, or code. However, abstract ideas should be furth
er developed through planning and reasoning in representation space. AR-LLMs bypass the step of reasoning in representat
ion space and directly generate answers from prompts [16][17][18].







The AI industry would be significantly hindere
d if research labs in the industry had not open sourced their code, patented everything, and enforced their patents. The
 open sourcing of code and lack of patent enforcement has been beneficial for the development and progress of the AI ind
ustry [19]. ChatGPT, for instance, is built with PyTorch [20]. The patents on ConvNets expired in 2007 [21][23].








Google AI has introduced StyleDrop, a model that allows for stylized text-to-image synthesis by using style reference im
ages instead of text prompts. This approach enables the generation of images in a style consistent with the reference, b
ypassing the need for text prompt engineering [33]. Google Research has developed Magic Editor, an AI-powered photo edit
or that allows users to easily make complex edits to photos using generative AI [34]. Google AI has also made recent adv
ances in using machine learning (ML) to improve the efficiency of ML workloads, introducing TpuGraphs and developing Gra
ph Segment Training [35].







NVIDIA AI hosted a webinar series on getting started with AI inference, focusing on bui
lding and deploying cloud-ready AI-inferencing solutions for large language models [31]. The paper titled 'Privacy Audit
ing with One (1) Training Run' by Thomas Steinke, Milad Nasr, and Matthew Jagielski has won the Best Paper award at Neur
IPS 2023 [32].

Hello,

I'm trying to understand what sort of background preparation in mathematics is sufficient to conduct publishable
 research in top venues.

Is calculus, linear algebra, engineering level probability & statistics and optimization suffi
cient ?

By **sufficient**, I mean the *bare minimum* you must know to get by and *you learn more things as you encounte
r them* or solve problems (**learning while doing**) without having to first prepare requisite background and then dive 
in.


My **main problem** is - at what point do I say let's directly jump into research and figure out things I don't kn
ow on the fly VS first learn the necessary background and then proceed. I'm familiar - not strong but have taken those c
ourses in undergrad but have largely forgotten many important concepts.

The **traditional** approach in mathematics (as
 suggested by MathOverflow folks) involves nothing short of solving textbook exercises in Math for mastery. This is larg
ely impractical/unfeasible and will take forever stalling me from actual research progress.

A **parallel** question is 
also - *how do you guys learn the math you don't know ? Do you actually solve textbook problems like folks from Math dep
artments ? Or just understand high level picture and key central idea without focusing on proofs or a dozen theorems sur
rounding it ?*

Any help from authors from ML venues is greatly appreciated. 

Please post only if you are an ML researc
her or from academia :).

Thank you very much !

```
Am visiting New Orleans for NeurIPS and stumbled across Papier Plume in the French Quarter. 

The gentleman there was so
 helpful! I originally went in for a Pilot vanishing point with a stub nib that I turned out not to like. I’ve wanted an
 823 with a falcon nib for a while but assumed they weren’t available in the USA. 

A short chat later - he swapped a Nu
mber 15 FA nib off another pen onto this one and I couldn’t be happier! 

Great to have the ergonomics and ink capacity 
of the 823 with this fantastic nib - if you don’t think about it, it’s a free flowing smooth fine nib, but slow down and
 pay attention and touch can get a lot of character with the flex - still very much learning how.

Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01139](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01139) Code: [https://github.com/davecasp/add-thin]

Generative diffusion models are all the rage, but it is unclear how they could be
 applied to sequences of varying numbers of events, e.g. tweets, reddit comments or taxi trips. We present a diffusion a
pproach that turns any sequence into a noise sequence, a sample from a homogeneous Poisson process. Conversely, our mode
l transforms such noise sequence samples iteratively into samples from any target data distribution by deleting events t
hat it classifies as noise and proposing new events from a learned (conditional) intensity distribution. Experimentally,
 we were able to demonstrate excellent forecasting performance on various benchmark datasets.

I am looking forward to d
iscuss our method here on reddit. If you happen to be at NeurIPS, you can also meet /u/davidluedke at poster #602 on Tue

```
Dear fellow NeurIPS rejects. As your deep learning, reinforcement learning, graph neural networks, and deep learning the
ory people fly off to New Orleans and you realize that you are left behind.

&#x200B;

I invite you to join me in this g
roup therapy discussion, where our topic of the day is Collusion Rings.

&#x200B;

I suppose that.... the first question
 is do they actually exist, and what is the extent of their penetration into the machine learning academic community? As
 someone who struggled many years to have their first paper published, it's my anecdotal evidence that machine learning 
is much more about marching to the beat of the drummer, where the drummer is certainly someone who is a fan of deep lear
ning.

&#x200B;

As someone struggling, still, to get another paper published, my anecdotal observation is the drum beat
ing has gotten even more fierce over the last few years.

&#x200B;

As someone who has had many, many conversations with
 others whom are also marginalized, our anecdotal data pools not quite to a dataset, but a filtration which is not i.i.d
., but certainly indicates actively farming deep learning citations is the better choice for our careers.

&#x200B;

As 
someone currently reviewing for ICLR/AAAI/AISTATS. My anecdotal evidence is the reviewer coordination is with secret han
dshakes, keywords, citations, reference lists, topics, arxiv preprints, and shibboleths.

&#x200B;

I hope you find the 
bravery to share your experience as one who is on the inside looking out, or on the outside looking in.

&#x200B;

As a 
beacon of hope, I remind you to read [The Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet](https://medium.com/@mijordan3/artificial-intel
ligence-the-revolution-hasnt-happened-yet-5e1d5812e1e7) by Michael Jordan.

&#x200B;

As a final question to ponder. Is 
the deep learning collusion ring already collapsing, and will it collapse further?

023) with a 3.69 in BSCS. I am kind of insecure about it ngl. I have one publication and it was in an image processing c
onference (SPIE) in Amsterdam. It is majorly about analyzing and processing remote sensing data. Other than that I have 
2.5 years of research experience during my degree as I worked in 2 different labs for almost 2.5 years. I also have almo
st 1.5 years of industry experience as I was working at a start up as an ML engineer and I am currently working remote i
n 3d vision as AI engineer at startup in Hongkong. I have won 3 hackathons (2 international and 1 national) and I also w
on the 2nd prize for my final year project.

Now i have seen people who are studying at NEU have stellar GPAs like 3.9s 
and 3.8s. The only reason mine fell cause I had to support my degree and that's why I was basically working part-time at
 the start up as an ML engineer. Publishing was my dream and I did in the end but its not in some shiny conference like 
CVPR or Neurips but ya I mean I  am thankful that I do have one. It wasn't easy. So idk if I stand a chance here at NEU 
and so here I am asking you guys to help me through this process. I am obviously planning to apply next year, cause I ha
ve to like save up for apps and IELTS.

I need to present a poster at NeurIPS 2023. However, I couldn't print it in my university due to some issues. Is there a
 place near the convention center that provides quick poster printing?  TIA

Happy Friday,

Really happy to share that the code and model for RETVec our new SOTA robust text tokenizer for classific
ation is available on Github [here](https://github.com/google-research/retvec/) and the NeurIPS paper [here](https://arx
iv.org/abs/2302.09207).  We also provide native support for TFLite and for the web via a TFJS. Hope you will find it use
ful for your research. If you would like to give it a try we have a get started [notebook](https://github.com/google-res
earch/retvec/blob/main/notebooks/train_retvec_model_tf.ipynb).

Let us know if you have any questions.

I'll be attending NeurIPS 2023 this year and won't know anyone. I'm an avid climber and there is a nice bouldering gym c
lose to the conference center - would anyone else fancy a climb over the week? Reply below so we can see how many people
 and I can setup a meetup page or something. I'm a final year PhD from the UK working in video understanding.
