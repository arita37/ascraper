```
I think OOD generalization is an important issue because it pulls in the distance from reality. But I am concerned that 
recent conferences like ICLR, ICML, NeurIPS etc. don't have many people working on this problem. And check out some OOD 
generalization benchmarks, many methods (Such as IRM, GroupDRO) are even weaker than ERM. So, I wonder if it's because o
f some difficulties in this field that people stopped studying it. Or is it because of some other reason.

```
I submitted a paper to NeurIPS with a model using mamba blocks. However, even before submitting the manuscript to openre
view, I had in mind some tweaks or ideas that I could try to improve the results. Now, after the recent release of mamba
-2 this situation is even more evident, since as stated in the new paper, some minor changes could improve the performan
ce and speed of my model.

For these reasons, since the submission date, I have been considering working on some old ide
as, and trying out the updated mamba blocks; nevertheless, I am afraid that this might be confusing for reviewers who ha
ve already read one version of the paper, and I guess they expect to discuss the model of that old version. Perhaps chan
ging so many things could be a bit confusing and even annoying for them.

On the other hand, I really think I could at l
east improve some metrics and even if I am dropped for this conference, I would be willing to have these improvements to
 try for another conference.

What would you do in that situation?

all -  [ [R] Are you a reviewer for NeurIPS'24? Please read this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1d9o8tn/r_are_you_a_reviewer_for_neurips24_please_read/) , 2024-06-18-0911
```
Hello!

I am currently serving as an area chair (AC) for [NeurIPS'24](https://neurips.cc/). The number of submissions is
 extremely high, and assigning qualified reviewers to these papers is tough.

**Why is it tough**, you may ask. At a hig
h-level, it's because we, as AC, have not enough information to gauge whether a paper is assigned to _a sufficient numbe
r_ (at least 3) of _qualified reviewers_ (i.e., individuals who can deliver an informative assessment of the paper). Ind
eed, as AC, we can only use the following criteria to decide whether to assign a reviewer to any given paper: (i) their 
bids; (ii) the 'affinity' score; (iii) their personal OpenReview profile. However

* Only a fraction of those who signed
 up as reviewers have bid on the papers. To give an idea, among the papers in my stack, 30% had no reviewer who bid on t
hem; actually, most of the papers had only 3-4 bids (not necessarily 'positive'). 
* When no bids are entered, the next 
indicator is the 'affinity' score. However, this metric is computed in an automatic way and works poorly (besides, one m
ay be an expert of a domain but they may be unwilling to review a certain paper, e.g., due to personal bias).
* The last
 indicator we can use is the 'background' of the reviewer, but this requires us (i.e., the ACs) to manually check the Op
enReview profile of each reviewer---which is time consuming. To make things worse, for this year's NeurIPS there is a (r
elatively) high number of reviewers who are undergrads or MS students, and whose OpenReview's profile is _completely emp
ty_.

Due to the above, I am writing this post to _ask for your cooperation_. If you're a reviewer for NeurIPS, **please
 ensure that your OpenReview profile is up to date**. If you are an undergrad/MS student, please include a link to a web
page that can show if you have any expertise in reviewing, or if you work in a lab with some 'expert researchers' (who c
an potentially help you by giving tips on how to review). The same also applies for PhD students or PostDocs: ensure tha
t the information available on OpenReview reflects your expertise and preferences.

Bottom line: you have accepted to se
rve as a reviewer of (arguably the top) a premier ML conference. **Please, take this duty seriously.** If you are assign
ed to the right papers, you will be able to provide more helpful reviews and the reviewing process will also be smoother
. Helpful reviews are useful to the authors and to the ACs. By doing a good job, you may even be awarded with 'top revie
wer' acknowledgements.

Hey all,

The ICML travel grant decisions were out earlier today. I am creating this thread in an effort to understand t
heir criteria in the selection process. Are there people/ students who were actually selected? It was really disappointi
ng to see that I was not awarded not even the registration fee waiver that was the default in other conferences (neurips

Sharing your thoughts and experience would be invaluable.

```
Hi guys,

I have a background in Informatics, focusing on (Geometric) Deep Learning on graphs and sequential data. I rec
ently started my PhD to contribute 'AI'-based (sorry for the buzzword) methods in the urban planning/energy optimization
 domains. I'm in the phase of doing literature reviews, but I'm not too familiar with how the field works. Could you sug
gest some prestigious conferences or journals focusing on the mentioned domains? 

So far, I have only looked into two j
ournals:

* Operations Research: [https://portal.core.edu.au/jnl-ranks/296/](https://portal.core.edu.au/jnl-ranks/296/) 

* European Journal Operational Research: [https://portal.core.edu.au/jnl-ranks/3/](https://portal.core.edu.au/jnl-ranks
/3/) 

Any survey papers that summarize the on-going problems to be solved (or even intersection with Informatics) would
 be appreciated. Thank you!

Edited: In case of getting too many downvotes, I have already done my own research as well,
 with ResearchRabbit to find most of the relevant papers. But they are scattered across many conferences/journals. So I 
wonder if there are centralized ones that most usually refer to. For example in pure ML, we have ICML, ICLR, NeuRIPs and
 so on.

# LLM Merging C
ompetition: Building LLMs Efficiently through Merging

*NeurIPS 2024 Challenge*

## Aims and Focus

Training high-perfor
ming large language models (LLMs) from scratch is a notoriously expensive and difficult task, costing hundreds of millio
ns of dollars in compute alone. These pretrained LLMs, however, can cheaply and easily be adapted to new tasks via fine-
tuning, leading to a proliferation of models that suit specific use cases. Recent work has shown that specialized fine-t
uned models can be rapidly **merged** to combine capabilities and generalize to new skills.

## Get started

The competi
tion will provide the participants with a list of expert models that have already been trained on a task-specific datase
t. All of these models will be publicly available on the Hugging Face Model Hub with licenses that permit their use for 
research purposes. These models can either be fully fine-tuned models or models obtained by parameter-efficient fine-tun
ing methods such as LoRA. Models on this list will be required to satisfy the following criteria: (1) model size <= 8B p
arameters, and (2) model with licenses compatible with research use (e.b., MIT, Apache 2 etc).

A starter kit with an en
d-to-end submission flow can be found here:

```
Hey, just read this paper:  
[https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper\_files/paper/2019/file/1e6e0a04d20f50967c64dac2d639a5
77-Paper.pdf](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/1e6e0a04d20f50967c64dac2d639a577-Paper.pdf)

Th
e gist of what the paper talks about is having a neural network that can grow itself based on the noise in the previous 
layers. They focus on emulating the neurology found in the brain and creating pooling layers. However, they don't go bey
ond a simple 2 layer network and testing on the MNIST. While the practical implementation might not be here yet, the ide
a seems interesting.

```
I feel like many would consider NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, etc as important venues in the field of ML. Even outside of ML, Neu
rIPS and ICLR have [the #9 and #10 highest H-index of any venues](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venue
s&hl=en). However, now I am looking at tenure-track positions globally, and it seems like a different story. It seems li
ke such publications are worthless for the purposes of immigration or academic tenure, because they are not traditional 
journals. You'll notice they are missing from the SCImago, a ranking which many organizations use as a proxy for publica
tion quality, and consequently tenure or immigration decisions.

  
I am curious as to what academic ML researchers do u
nder these circumstances. Do you stop submitting to NeurIPS and aim to publish in ACM 'Foundation and Trends in Machine 
Learning', a journal which [ranks #2 on SCImago instead](https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php)? Or the ever-growing
 list of IEEE journals on machine learning?

all -  [ [R] Machine learning introspection ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1d4dx88/r_machine_learning_introspection/) , 2024-06-18-0911
```
While 'introspection' is not well-defined in AI, it does have a long history - mainly to equip machines with human intui
tion for problem solving, with Newell and Simon's 'General Problem Solver' (1958) being an early example. According to [
Roger Grosse](https://lips.cs.princeton.edu/introspection-in-ai/) the field has moved away from introspection due to wha
t he views as an aversion to thinking about algorithms in terms of mental states.

  
However, this week we released a [
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drlqCc_e_o0) that goes over these basic ideas and explores two papers on the conc
ept of introspection that have been released over the past few years.  The first being '[Introspective CNN's](https://pr
oceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/11b921ef080f7736089c757404650e40-Paper.pdf) that  improves classificati
on results by synthesizing samples from its own classifier (as opposed to a GAN which uses a separate discriminator netw
ork to generate samples).  This is why the approach is called 'introspective' because it uses its own classifier.

The [
second paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13710#:~:text=27%20Sep%202022%5D-,Towards%20Human%2DCompatible%20XAI%3A%20Expla
ining%20Data%20Differentials%20with,Concept%20Induction%20over%20Background%20Knowledge&text=Concept%20induction%2C%20wh
ich%20is%20based,base%20data%20(ABox)%20graph) uses concept induction to create a set of concepts to describe why a syst
em made a classification decision for the user.  Here the evaluation focused on the human's understanding of the explana
tion, as opposed to using it to make the classification result better.  This actually relates to an [earlier video](http
s://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26tTT8saaDs&t=2517s) we released with Prof. [Joao Leite](https://scholar.google.com/citation
s?user=ReF98QcAAAAJ&hl=en) where he discussed his results using 'mapping neural networks' to perform a determination of 
concepts as well (you can also see [his paper](https://userweb.fct.unl.pt/~jleite/papers/aaai21.pdf)).

MILA is the Montreal-based AI lab founded by Yoshua Bengio, in collaboration with the University of Montreal and McGill 
University.

The lab is the place GANs were originally invented in the early 2010's, along with many other seminal paper
s in the industry (mostly in machine learning and deep learning).

It publishes a similar number of papers to convention
s like NeurIPS as Princeton, Cornell or Harvard, but doesn't seem to have the same name recognition.

What is the indust
ry's view on MILA? Is it as well-known as other university labs like SAIL? Does the industry hold MILA students in high 
regard?

Hi all,

I’ve been out of school for a while. I wasn’t able to get a PhD earlier due to life stuff. But I’d like to go b
ack and get my PhD, I’m trying to figure out what programs are realistic to target.

My top choice is CMU, but things ar
e extremely competitive right now.

Undergrad: Top three Ivy
GPA 3.3, magna cum laude in major
Research: 2 years in unde
rgrad won best undergraduate research poster, and got a Sigma Xi award.

Post-undergrad: 
AI research scientist at large
 government company for around 6 years
Research: first author paper at NeurIPS, lots of classified research, three paper
s at smaller conferences (one first author). Have a package with a like 200 stars on GitHub. A couple company awards for
 my research, and best research project of the year award from the government.

Misc: Invited as a guest lecturer a coup
le times.

I’m really disconnected from the general space of academia, but am finally at a place where I feel like I can
 get my PhD, which haven’t been able to.

Would love to hear thoughts and guidance on what programs would be good target
s.

```
VERSES AI ($VERS), a cognitive computing company, is continuing to make big strides in AI. They’ve introduced a research
 roadmap that outlines the key milestones and benchmarks. This roadmap could revolutionize the development of AI by prov
iding clear goals to measure the progress and importance of $VER's research and development endeavors.

The company plan
s to use this roadmap this year to monitor its AI progress. Basically, it wants to check whether its approach can be as 
good as or better than advanced AI models on various industry tests, all while using less data and energy.

By meeting t
hese benchmarks, VERSES can prove that they can create AI that is better, cheaper, and faster. The end goal is to get th
eir AI into more hands through their Genius Platform.

Research Roadmap Highlights:

VERSES’ research roadmap has 3 benc
hmarks: Classification and generation tasks, Atari 10k Challenge, and NeurIPS 2024 Melting Pot Challenge

The first benc
hmark, Classification and generation tasks, focuses on proving $VER's approach is better at tasks like recognizing image
s and creating new ones. By utilizing advanced Bayesian inference techniques, they are trying to show that their method 
has the ability to outperform traditional deep learning methods. This test is important because it shows whether VERSES 
can make top-quality AI while being more efficient.

The second benchmark, the Atari 10k Challenge, is all about testing
 VERSES' AI skills in playing video games. Unlike conventional methods that need a lot of gameplay data, VERSES is tryin
g to play video games almost like a human but with way less practice. $VERS is using active inference to help their AI b
e super adaptable. And by doing this, they're hoping to raise the bar for how well AI can perform in gaming

Lastly, the
re’s the NeurIPS 2024 Melting Pot Challenge. This is all about testing how well VERSES' can handle tricky situations whe
re lots of different AI systems need to work together. $VERS wants to show that their AI can understand these complicate
d situations and work smoothly with other AI systems. Through the use of active inference and explicit representational 
structures, VERSES aims to become a leader in creating AI systems that can collaborate effectively and tackle complex pr
oblems together.

$VERS publicly released this roadmap so the public can track their progress. The roadmap can be access
ed here: [www.verses.ai/rd-overview](http://www.verses.ai/rd-overview)

```
I work on statistical ML. I notice that many people (including myself and those that I review) often recycle their submi
ssions for ML conferences.

E.g., if their papers got rejected by ICML, they submit to NeurIPS, and later to ICLR (or UA
I/AISTATS which are also top in my field). If they did not get into ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR after 2\~3 times, they would submi
t them to AAAI/IJCAI/TMLR/ICDM, journals like T-NNLS/T-KDD/NN/Neurocomputing, or domain-specific venues like LoG/CoLLAs/
AABI. After all these, if the paper still did not get accepted, they then simply put them or arXiv. I believe this might
 also be the case for CV/NLP.

As a reviewer, I often encounter conference submissions where the authors resubmit withou
t really taking into account the previous reviews provided. Sometimes they do incorporate the reviews when resubmitting-
-but sometimes the work may just be not at the level of Tier 1 conferences but they just keep resubmitting and hoping th
at they can accepted by chance.

I think that this is consuming a lot of reviewers' time from the community to keep revi
ewing the same submissions (especially given that NeurIPS hits 20k submission id; I expect to see many resubmissions). T
his is perhaps also one of the reason TMLR was born (to emphasize correctness instead of novelty).

I do understand argu
ments like 'the quality of research is more important than the publication venues' or 'OpenAI often simply just put thei
r papers like GPT-X on arXiv these days'. However, students or junior researchers also need publications in their career
, including myself. 

What do folks think about it?
