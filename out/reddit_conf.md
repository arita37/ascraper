Did all reviewers get free passes or is this a lottery system and/or based on review quality? I didn’t plan on attending

Update: There is clear evidence a single individual 'Enervation' was responsible as of April 6th 2023 of changing the co
re definition of what AGI is supposed to be. There is an obvious conflict of interest here as the definition is matching
 to exactly what is on the OpenAI charter. The question is for all of you is this, Should 1 organization be defining wha
t Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is and should be? 

It should be note, that this user (Enervation) [has a MASSIV
E change log from the April 6th date moving forward for issues ranging from AGI, AI Safety and a plethora of other AI is
sues and concerns.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/Enervation&target=Enervation&offset

\------------------------------ end update 

My issue with this is why is one organization defining
 what AI is? And so drastically at that. Why isn't there a community of AI scientist and engineer's that are agreeing on
 such a pivotal definition for an agreed upon general consensus? 

**Original Post:**

Upon researching why people are s
o confused by what is meant by the today's (apparently) lightning rod term 'Artificial General Intelligence' or 'AGI' on
e would have to look to none other than how OpenAI moved the goal post of what AGI is. Wikipedia: [https://en.wikipedia.

Odd, who is notation 4? Hmm, who could that be that wrote an update to what the definition of what 
AGI means. Oh it's OpenAI themselves.

4. ['OpenAI Charter'](https://openai.com/charter). *openai.com*. Retrieved 6 Apri
l 2023.

I'm not going to go into a diatribe about how the definition is purely related to Effective Altruism and not ro
oted in technical reality. But I will show you that just a few paragraphs down in the same article they describe AGI in 
a much different way.

\>  Terminology

AGI is also known as strong AI,[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial
_general_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKurzweil2005260-10)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_int
elligence#cite_note-Kurzweil_2005-08-05-11) full AI,[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligen
ce#cite_note-12) human-level AI[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:2-5) or 
general intelligent action.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewe
llSimon1976-13) However, some academic sources reserve the term 'strong AI' for computer programs that experience [senti
ence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience) or [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness).[\[a\]](h
ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-Searle's_Strong_AI-14) In contrast, weak AI (or n
arrow AI) is able to solve one specific problem, but lacks general cognitive abilities.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org
/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-15)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligenc
e#cite_note-Kurzweil_2005-08-05-11) Some academic sources use 'weak AI' to refer more broadly to any programs that neith
er experience consciousness nor have a mind in the same sense as humans.[\[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial
_general_intelligence#cite_note-Searle's_Strong_AI-14)

Related concepts include artificial [superintelligence](https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence) and transformative AI. An artificial superintelligence (ASI) is a hypothetical 
type of AGI that is much more generally intelligent than humans.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_genera
l_intelligence#cite_note-16) And the notion of transformative AI relates to AI having a large impact on society, for exa
mple similar to the agricultural revolution.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_
note-17)

It seems as if they wanted to water down and dilute the understanding and meaning of what AGI is for perhaps I
 don't know contractual obligations?

* Fourth, pr
ofit allocated to investors and employees, including Microsoft, is capped. All residual value created above and beyond t
he cap will be returned to the Nonprofit for the benefit of humanity.
* Fifth, the board determines when we've attained 
AGI. Again, by AGI we mean a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work. Such a
 system is excluded from IP licenses and other commercial terms with Microsoft, which only apply to pre-AGI technology.


Interestingly this was reported in many places as much as 6 days ago.

Point is. How do you get t
o change the goal post and determine all by yourselves what AGI is? Nah this isn't going to fly. Nice try. I feel this v
erbiage is going to get changed very soon.

I have read many posts in this subreddit complaining about the lack of communications and results from DreamLab and the 
teams behind the various projects. I must agree that these two are the most critical issues about DreamLab and the burde
n of solving them shouldn't be given to the users. However I decided to write this post to give a better insight to what
 DreamLab has achieved so far. While the results are far from being as much as those of F@H and BOINC, I think that ther
e are some interesting one. Do note that I do not have a technical background, I do not belong to any scientific team th
at worked on DreamLab projects, I'm just a user as you.

 Alzheimer's disease was on the list of research area on the old DRUGS projects, maybe some older users knows more than 
me. However the methodology is most likely the same. There is an interesting list of molecules present in olive oil that
 could have benefits for the disease. The paper is limited by the fact that there are very few drugs on trial for this d

Please notice that my research was definetely more focused on the DRUGS/CORONA-AI projects, so the results are d

B. Context :

\--> I am experimenting with the non-continuous lunar lander 
environment using gym library. And I want to add two additional features that are introduced as random noise, incrementi
ng the observation space  to (8 + 2 ) = 10. I will then train my lunar lander using PPO algorithm, and use my feature se
lection framework to rank them and select the original 8 features, i.e excluding noise. (2 features.)

C. What do I need
 help with ?

\--> How should I be adding the noise ? Meaning what type of noise should be ideal for this ? I'm new to  
RL, and hence still learning.

D. What I have seen so far  on my own:

\--> After scouring some google searches on ' how
 to introduce noise in RL' lead me to other reddit posts, medium articles. I found that these lead me to the following t
opics :

1. Out-of-Distribution Detection in RL, Ex paper : [https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14990](https://arxiv.org/abs/200
4.14990), [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.02694.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.02694.pdf), [https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.4898
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.4898),
2. Introducing Noise for Exploration : [https://h2t.iar.kit.edu/pdf/Plappert2018.pdf

//arxiv.org/pdf/1706.10295.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.10295.pdf).

Some additional questions :

1. While searching 
for  'How to add NOISE in RL' opened me up to a whole new world of types of NOISE. My goal is to : a. add noise in my ob
servation space, b. possibly add a type of noise replicating real-world noise. (Most common ones I see are talking about
 Gaussian noise).
2. My feature selection framework accounts for implicit-state-reward dependency, similar to section A 
paper 1 linked above. The GOAL of my research is build algorithms to improve ROBUSTNESS, AND SAFETY for applicatIons usi
ng RL. Hence, building a custom feature selection framework is one of the first step towards it. PLEASE feel free to lin
k other open challenges in real-world RL applications, so I have the opportunity to address and work on them in my futur
e works.

THANK YOU !

Hey guys,

Im looking for a profile evaluation, and suggestions. I applied to PhD programs last cycle and was accepted t
o 2, which I turned down. Im applying this cycle again. My profile is pretty similar and so are my recommendations, so I
m not sure if I should have high hopes. Currently 3.8 GPA MS in CS student at a top 30 US University (by CS rankings for
 AI). 2 publications in robotics (IROS), 1 in NeurIPS this year (but I'm the 4th author), and 1 first author work under 
review at ICLR, one under review at  AAAI. 2 pretty strong recommendations, one from a faculty whose course I took and T
A'd for.

Im planning on applying to:
MILA, UNC Chapel Hill, CMU, NYU, USC, SFU, UCR, Virgina Tech, University of Washin
gton. 

One drawback of my profile is that I was enrolled as a PhD at my current uni, and didn't like the topic and didn
t find a good fit. So I've decided to apply elsewhere (finishing up as a MS at my current uni), but I think this negativ
ely impacts my applications because I thought I had a good profile but didn't get any interviews last year. Let me know 
what you think

```
I recently began my career as a Machine Learning Engineer, marking my first job in the industry. A few months ago, I com
pleted an MPhil program specializing in Environmental Engineering, with a research focus on applying ML in that field. T
hroughout my job search, I frequently encounter questions about my academic background. Additionally, utilizing ML techn
ologies has become increasingly convenient with the availability of user-friendly APIs.

&#x200B;

To enhance my competi
tiveness in the industry, I am looking to take proactive steps. I have been actively staying updated on ML technologies 
and trends, and now I am considering the following options:

1. As an independent researcher, try to publish papers in t
op conferences in the field like CVPR and NeurIPS.

2. Expand my knowledge in data engineering and MLops and work on end
-to-end personal projects.

&#x200B;

I understand that both of these options require a significant investment of time a
nd energy. Therefore, I wonder which option would be more worthwhile in terms of my time and effort. It is important to 
note that I am interested in working in the industry and do not intend to pursue a career in academia.

If anyone is interested in learning AI/LLM's and you’re more familiar with dotnet than python, take a look at my [NanoGp
tDotnet](https://github.com/biegehydra/NanoGptDotnet) project. It is a direct translation of a [project](https://github.
com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture) by Andrej Karpathy, a leading expert in deep learning and LLM's. His project was written 
while recording the youtube video: [Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?
v=kCc8FmEb1nY) The design used in the better model, NanoGpt in my project, is based off the breakthrough [Attention Is A

The project is meant to be a learning aid for you to learn about LLM's. I added a lot of the comments from Andrej 
Karpathy, some of my own comments, some from GPT-4, and timestamps to relevant sections of the youtube video. The projec
t uses TorchSharp (from the dotnet team) which uses the same naming conventions as python so the knowledge you gain from
 my project is very translatable to python. I also tried to never use the var keyword so you can have a better idea of w
hat's going on.

The NanoGpt project is only 600 lines of code, most of which are whitespace and comments, so don't hesi
tate to give it a look and let me know what you think!

Hi ML community, 

I'm nearing the end of my three-year PhD journey. Throughout this period, I've dedicated myself to pr
oducing a research paper annually, targeting top-tier conferences like ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS. Despite my efforts and r
esubmissions, none of my papers made it through. As a result, my publication record consists solely of three manuscripts
 on arXiv.

My initial post-PhD ambition was to delve deeper into machine learning research at leading tech companies su
ch as Facebook, Google, or Microsoft. However, my applications were turned down, primarily due to the lack of publicatio
ns in prestigious conferences, which seems to be a crucial criterion for these roles.

Confronted with this setback and 
the pressing need to manage my finances, I shifted my focus to more traditional industry roles in consulting and finance
. I've recently secured a position in quant finance, which, while exciting, means I won't have the bandwidth to revisit 
and resubmit my research papers.

Reflecting on this journey, I sometimes feel disheartened, questioning the value of my
 PhD experience, especially when I consider my lack of published work in major machine learning conferences.

I see othe
r PhD students in my field publish 2 papers per year in these top conferences which makes me wonder whether I am a failu
re? I'm open to any thoughts or advice on my situation.

```
I've had the Neurio Home Energy Monitor (USA, Split Phase) for many, many years. Since they first came to the market, I 
was an early adapter. 
And it's been **rock solid**.

I just ordered another one for my cabin. (New in box from eBay, ab
out $60 after shipping (I set up scheduled alert, and low-balled a best offer)
I had it up and running in minutes. (Conn
ected to WiFi, registered to my existing cloud account, API enabled, and integrated in Home Assistant). 

Despite being 
vaporware and sold off to Generac and later abandoned, the API lives on,and the Home Assistant integration keeps working
. 
AND EVEN IF THEY DO KILL THE API (Aka, 'The MyQ treatment'), THERE IS STILL LOCAL ACCESS. (Which I don't use, YET)

*
*Existing Home Assistant integration:**  
https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/neurio_energy  
Two sensors will be
 created with the following names:   
* Energy Usage: Current active power usage in Watts. Updated every 10 seconds.   

* Daily Energy Usage: Daily power usage in kWh. Updated every 2.5 minutes.   

Polls via the cloud API (Which is still a
ctive!)  
https://api-docs.neur.io/#overview   

   
**Local Sensor Access:**  
JSON via IP:  
Example:   
http://192.16
8.1.xxxx/current-sample   
https://api-docs.neur.io/#sensor-local-access   
And in case the cloud doc ever goes missing,
 I've cloned it here: https://pastebin.com/raw/7YUCSzCe
   

Food for thought for those looking for an energy monitoring
 solution, but don't want to shell out a lot of money. 
I was about to pull the trigger on the 'DIY-ish' methods, but af
ter getting the board, CT sensors, etc, it will still going to cost at least $100. On top of that, forums are full of pe
ople struggling to set them up, calibrate them properly, etc.  I wasn't up for the task. I wanted a turn-key solution re
ady out of the box.

all -  [ Effect of GPA, and Chances at Top CS PhD Programs? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/17pq2ta/effect_of_gpa_and_chances_at_top_cs_phd_programs/) , 2023-11-22-0910
```
Hi folks! I'm an undergraduate senior studying CS and Statistics at a T10 undergrad school (not for CS PhD, though); I'm
 also concurrently getting my M.S. in CS here as well. I have research experience in industry (at a top AI Research lab 
for 2 summers and ongoing part-time during the year for follow-up work / paper writing) and in academia (undergraduate h
onors thesis, and several collaborations with researchers both at my university and elsewhere). I have a few publication
s -- 2 at workshops (NeurIPS) and 4 pre-prints for papers under review at tier 1 venues (all first-author or co-first au
thor). I will add that my research experience appears to be a little unorthodox at the undergrad level, as most of my pr
ojects in academia have been self-initiated and self-devised, turning to mentor(s) (profs and sometimes PhD students) fo
r feedback, rather than working in a lab consistently with PhD students, postdocs, and a professor.

I also have quite a
 bit of teaching experience (TA'd 6 courses, all upper-level, majority being graduate-level) and some professional servi
ce (served as a reviewer for a few tier-1 conference workshops; some departmental service and other leadership stuff too
). LoRs most likely coming from an industry mentor, a research (thesis) advisor, and another professor I was Head TA for
 (am curious if there are any opinions on whether I should be going in a different direction for the 3rd recommender).


The reason I'm posting here is: I'm nervous that my GPA is a bit lower than the top programs' averages, and I'm wonderin
g if that'll be strongly held against me / a dealbreaker. Part of the reason for this is mental health struggles while b
eing overwhelmed with commitments. I'd say my course rigor is generally pretty strong (given that a lot of the technical
 courses are graduate / doctoral-level) despite that, but I'm worried that the GPA may be an immediate turnoff for those
 reviewing my application. As you probably can expect, I'm interested in Stanford, MIT, Princeton, CMU, etc.

Thanks in 
advance for your feedback and insights (and for taking the time to read all of this :))!!

all -  [ At what programs am I competitive? - PhD in CS (AI/ML) ](https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/17gskbg/at_what_programs_am_i_competitive_phd_in_cs_aiml/) , 2023-11-22-0910
```
 I plan to apply to 10-12 CS PhD programs, with a research focus in ML/NLP. 

While I understand that many successful ap
plicants in top programs have published NeurIPS/CVPR/ACL/EMNLP papers and are from prestigious labs/schools, what rankin
gs of programs should I expect to be a competitive applicant for? #10-20? #20-40? #40-60? etc.

&#x200B;

\- 4.0 GPA fro
m a small private school in California, graduated #1 in class

\- 2 years as an RA in an on-campus NLP lab, while also d
oing independent research

\- 3 first author research papers (1 in submission at an A-tier conference, 2 on arXiv)

\- 1
 second author paper (in submission at an A-tier conference)

\- 3 LoRs from profs who know me well. I am confident that
 they will be quite strong, discussing my research and leadership abilities. But the profs are relatively unknown in aca
demia

\- Strong (I think) SoP, taking inspiration from many previously successful applicants. My research experiences a
nd interests are very well-defined and catered to specific schools/profs

\- Currently an SWE at a well-known company (n
ot FAANG). I also do NLP consulting

\- 3 SWE internships

\- 330 GRE (169Q, 161V, 5.0AW)

\- A couple of solid ML proje
cts in school

&#x200B;

What kind of schools should I target? Where would be a reach? Any safeties?

(Specific schools 
listed below are arbitrary examples)

\#10-20: UCLA/USC/UNC/Duke

\#20-40: NYU/UCI/Rice/Ohio St

\#40-60: NCSU/Vanderbil
t/UT Dallas/UCF

all -  [ [D] Are people in ML Phds still happy? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/17fahm6/d_are_people_in_ml_phds_still_happy/) , 2023-11-22-0910
```
As an outsider who has many friends in ML Phds, this is my perspective of their lives:

1. long hours, working nights, w
eekends
2. no work-life balance, constant fear of being scooped and time pressure from deadlines
3. frustrating broken r
eview systems
4. many incremental, advertisement papers that produce very little actual contribution (which is justified
 by 2.)
5. 'engineering' and not 'science'
6. all this pressure amounts to severe imposter syndrome

Are people in the f
ield still happy? Where do people get their satisfaction? To me it looks like almost like a religion or a cult. The sele
ct few who say, get neurips outstanding paper are promoted to stardom - almost a celebrity status while everyone else su
ffers a punishing work cycle. Are the phd students all banking on AGI? What else motivates them?

Edit: the discussion i
s about whether 1-6 are worse in ML than other fields (or even the median experience). The reference for 'other field' i
s highly heterogenous. Experience obviously varies by lab, and then even by individuals within labs. 'It happens in othe
r fields too' is a trivial statement - of course some version of 1-6 affects somebody in another field.

Edit 2: small n
 but summarizing the comments - experience seems to differ based on geographic region, one's expectations for the phd, a
bility to exert work-life balance, and to some extent ignore the trends others are all following. Some people have reson
ated with problems 1-6, yet others have presented their own, anecdotal solutions. I recommend reading comments from thos
e who claim to have solutions.

all -  [ [R] Biologically plausible vision models for classification and grasping tasks ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/17ea25h/r_biologically_plausible_vision_models_for/) , 2023-11-22-0910
```
Hey everyone! I am looking for papers that propose or explore biologically plausible vision models, primarily tasks like
 classification and grasping (predicting grasping bounding boxes) tasks. By biologically plausible, I mean papers that p
ropose models inspired by the human brain in some way or the other. I know convolution is loosely inspired by human cogn
ition, but everything I can find seems to suggest the opposite for ViT like models.

I have come across certain papers l
ike these:
- https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00945
- https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/98b17f068d5d9b7668e19fb8a
e470841-Abstract.html

But I am still looking for more. Any suggestions?
