```
Dear fellow NeurIPS rejects. As your deep learning, reinforcement learning, graph neural networks, and deep learning the
ory people fly off to New Orleans and you realize that you are left behind.

&#x200B;

I invite you to join me in this g
roup therapy discussion, where our topic of the day is Collusion Rings.

&#x200B;

I suppose that.... the first question
 is do they actually exist, and what is the extent of their penetration into the machine learning academic community? As
 someone who struggled many years to have their first paper published, it's my anecdotal evidence that machine learning 
is much more about marching to the beat of the drummer, where the drummer is certainly someone who is a fan of deep lear
ning.

&#x200B;

As someone struggling, still, to get another paper published, my anecdotal observation is the drum beat
ing has gotten even more fierce over the last few years.

&#x200B;

As someone who has had many, many conversations with
 others whom are also marginalized, our anecdotal data pools not quite to a dataset, but a filtration which is not i.i.d
., but certainly indicates actively farming deep learning citations is the better choice for our careers.

&#x200B;

As 
someone currently reviewing for ICLR/AAAI/AISTATS. My anecdotal evidence is the reviewer coordination is with secret han
dshakes, keywords, citations, reference lists, topics, arxiv preprints, and shibboleths.

&#x200B;

I hope you find the 
bravery to share your experience as one who is on the inside looking out, or on the outside looking in.

&#x200B;

As a 
beacon of hope, I remind you to read [The Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet](https://medium.com/@mijordan3/artificial-intel
ligence-the-revolution-hasnt-happened-yet-5e1d5812e1e7) by Michael Jordan.

&#x200B;

As a final question to ponder. Is 
the deep learning collusion ring already collapsing, and will it collapse further?

```
Hey all,

Hope you all are doing good. I am planning to apply for CS Phd program at [Khoury College of Computer Sciences
](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at NEU where I majorly want to focus on 3d vision. I graduated this year (June 2
023) with a 3.69 in BSCS. I am kind of insecure about it ngl. I have one publication and it was in an image processing c
onference (SPIE) in Amsterdam. It is majorly about analyzing and processing remote sensing data. Other than that I have 
2.5 years of research experience during my degree as I worked in 2 different labs for almost 2.5 years. I also have almo
st 1.5 years of industry experience as I was working at a start up as an ML engineer and I am currently working remote i
n 3d vision as AI engineer at startup in Hongkong. I have won 3 hackathons (2 international and 1 national) and I also w
on the 2nd prize for my final year project.

Now i have seen people who are studying at NEU have stellar GPAs like 3.9s 
and 3.8s. The only reason mine fell cause I had to support my degree and that's why I was basically working part-time at
 the start up as an ML engineer. Publishing was my dream and I did in the end but its not in some shiny conference like 
CVPR or Neurips but ya I mean I  am thankful that I do have one. It wasn't easy. So idk if I stand a chance here at NEU 
and so here I am asking you guys to help me through this process. I am obviously planning to apply next year, cause I ha
ve to like save up for apps and IELTS.

I’ve recently completed a soccer prediction model using a custom neural net architecture, which exceeds the best model p

rious roles[7][8][9][29]. The company aims to make video creation accessible to everyone and is looking for passionate a
nd ambitious team members[8].







A new AI system, Sturgeon, has been developed for brain tumor surgeries. It uses ra
pid nanopore sequencing to obtain molecular subclassification of tumors in under 90 minutes. The system can assist in ne
urosurgical decision-making and potentially prevent additional surgeries[42][43].







Artie has launched its Analytic
s Portal, a real-time database replication solution that provides visibility into streaming data pipelines and offers sy
stem infrastructure monitoring[45]. Decoherence has launched Stable Video, a next-generation video generator that allows
 users to create videos with remarkable camera movement and fidelity using just a starting image or text[46]. Solve Inte
lligence, a legal tech startup, has raised $3 million in funding. The company provides an AI-powered in-browser document
 editor for patent attorneys to write high-quality patents efficiently[47].







NVIDIA has announced NeMo Retriever, 
a microservice that allows for the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities into AI applications
. RAG combines information retrieval with large language models (LLMs) to enhance their knowledge and address limitation
s[50][53]. NVIDIA's AI technology, Picasso, has been recognized as one of the Next Big Things in Tech in AI and data by 
Fast Company[49][52].







Google Research has made contributions to Call Screen on Pixel phones, a feature that uses 
on-device ASR to transcribe callers' requests in real-time[55]. The Google Research team in Ghana has been collecting da
ta to train automatic speech recognition models for local languages in Africa[57].







SDXL Turbo is a real-time text
-to-image generation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance by using a new distillation technology. This techn
ology allows for single-step image generation with high quality[58]. Yann LeCun and Catherine Rathkopf wrote an essay di
scussing the misconception that language models like ChatGPT are intelligent simply because they are fluent[61].

OpenAI's approach to Q-Learning has been drawing significant attention recently.

However, there's a fundamental issue i
n the way Q-learning is typically implemented in deep learning and neural network environments. This concern is highligh
ted in the award-winning paper 'Non-delusional Q-learning,' presented at NeurIPS.

The paper suggests a fundamental flaw
 in the blind application of Q-learning updates to deep neural networks. It points out that such updates can create a se
lf-contradictory scenario where improving the network for the current batch of data inadvertently makes it less effectiv
e for other batches. This is akin to a situation in supervised learning where optimizing a network for a specific set of
 data may degrade its performance on other datasets.

For more insights, the full paper can be accessed here: [Non-delus
ional Q-learning Paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2018/hash/5fd0245f6c9ddbdf3eff0f505975b6a7-Abstract.htm
l)(Follow up ICML paper: [Practical Non-delusional-Q Learning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cebly/Papers/CONQUR_ICML_2020
_camera_ready.pdf) )

I'm curious about others' views on this topic. What do you think about the implications of these f
indings for the future of Q-learning in deep learning environments?

hanging the core definition of what AGI is supposed to be. There is an obvious conflict of interest here as the definiti
on is matching to exactly what is on the OpenAI charter. The question is for all of you is this, Should 1 organization b
e defining what Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is and should be?

It should be note, that this user (Enervation) 
[has a MASSIVE change log from the April 6th date moving forward for issues ranging from AGI, AI Safety and a plethora o

**After
 Enervation's edits: >>>**

An **artificial general intelligence** (**AGI**) is a hypothetical type of [intelligent agen
t](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligenc
e#cite_note-NYT-20230630-1) If realized, an AGI could learn to accomplish any intellectual task that [human beings](http
s://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_beings) or animals can perform.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_
intelligence#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:10-3) Alternat
ively, AGI has been defined as an autonomous system that surpasses human capabilities in the majority of economically va
luable tasks.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:1-4) Creating AGI is a pri
mary goal of some [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) research and of compa
nies such as [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI),[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_int
elligence#cite_note-:1-4) [DeepMind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind), and [Anthropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/w
iki/Anthropic). AGI is a common topic in [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) and [futures s
tudies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_studies).

The timeline for AGI development remains a subject of ongoing d
ebate among researchers and experts. Some argue that it may be possible in years or decades; others maintain it might ta
ke a century or longer; and a minority believe it may never be achieved.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial
_general_intelligence#cite_note-:2-5) Additionally, there is debate regarding whether modern [large language models](htt
ps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model), such as [GPT-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4), are early yet in
complete forms of AGI[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:11-6) or if new ap
proaches are required.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:3-7)

Contention 
exists over the potential for AGI to pose a threat to humanity;[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_
intelligence#cite_note-NYT-20230630-1) for example, OpenAI treats it as an [existential risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/w
iki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_general_intelligence), while others find the development of AGI to be too remote to
 present a risk.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-8)[\[5\]](https://en.wik
ipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:2-5)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_
intelligence#cite_note-:3-7)

\------------------------------ end update

My issue with this is why is one organization 
defining what AI is? And so drastically at that. Why isn't there a community of AI scientist and engineer's that are agr
eeing on such a pivotal definition for an agreed upon general consensus?

e are so confused by what is meant by the today's (apparently) lightning rod term 'Artificial General Intelligence' or '
AGI' one would have to look to none other than how OpenAI moved the goal post of what AGI is. Wikipedia: [https://en.wik
ipedia.org/wiki/Artificial\_general\_intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)

\>  A
n **artificial general intelligence** (**AGI**) is a hypothetical type of [intelligent agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/w
iki/Intelligent_agent).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-NYT-20230630-1) I
f realized, an AGI could learn to accomplish any intellectual task that [human beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hum
an_beings) or animals can perform.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-2)[\[3
\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:10-3) Alternatively, AGI has been defined a
s an autonomous system that surpasses human capabilities in the majority of economically valuable tasks.[\[4\]](https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:1-4) Creating AGI is a primary goal of some [artificial
 intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) research and of companies such as [OpenAI](https:/
/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI),[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:1-4) [De
epMind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind), and [Anthropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic). AGI is a comm
on topic in [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) and [futures studies](https://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Futures_studies).

Odd, who is notation 4? Hmm, who could that be that wrote an update to what the definition o
f what AGI means. Oh it's OpenAI themselves.

4. ['OpenAI Charter'](https://openai.com/charter). *openai.com*. Retrieved
 6 April 2023.

I'm not going to go into a diatribe about how the definition is purely related to Effective Altruism and
 not rooted in technical reality. But I will show you that just a few paragraphs down in the same article they describe 
AGI in a much different way.

\>  Terminology

AGI is also known as strong AI,[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art
ificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKurzweil2005260-10)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_gene
ral_intelligence#cite_note-Kurzweil_2005-08-05-11) full AI,[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_int
elligence#cite_note-12) human-level AI[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:2
-5) or general intelligent action.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTN
OTENewellSimon1976-13) However, some academic sources reserve the term 'strong AI' for computer programs that experience
 [sentience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience) or [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness).[\
[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-Searle's_Strong_AI-14) In contrast, weak A
I (or narrow AI) is able to solve one specific problem, but lacks general cognitive abilities.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipe
dia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-15)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_inte
lligence#cite_note-Kurzweil_2005-08-05-11) Some academic sources use 'weak AI' to refer more broadly to any programs tha
t neither experience consciousness nor have a mind in the same sense as humans.[\[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art
ificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-Searle's_Strong_AI-14)

Related concepts include artificial [superintelligence](h
ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence) and transformative AI. An artificial superintelligence (ASI) is a hypoth
etical type of AGI that is much more generally intelligent than humans.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial
_general_intelligence#cite_note-16) And the notion of transformative AI relates to AI having a large impact on society, 
for example similar to the agricultural revolution.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligenc
e#cite_note-17)

It seems as if they wanted to water down and dilute the understanding and meaning of what AGI is for pe
rhaps I don't know contractual obligations?

[https://openai.com/our-structure](https://openai.com/our-structure)

* Fou
rth, profit allocated to investors and employees, including Microsoft, is capped. All residual value created above and b
eyond the cap will be returned to the Nonprofit for the benefit of humanity.
* Fifth, the board determines when we've at
tained AGI. Again, by AGI we mean a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.
 Such a system is excluded from IP licenses and other commercial terms with Microsoft, which only apply to pre-AGI techn
ology.

Interestingly this was reported in many places as much as 6 days ago.

[https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/25bb2-op
enais-board-to-determine-agi](https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/25bb2-openais-board-to-determine-agi)

Point is. How do yo
u get to change the goal post and determine all by yourselves what AGI is? Nah this isn't going to fly. Nice try. I feel
 this verbiage is going to get changed very soon.

I have read many posts in this subreddit complaining about the lack of communications and results from DreamLab and the 
teams behind the various projects. I must agree that these two are the most critical issues about DreamLab and the burde
n of solving them shouldn't be given to the users. However I decided to write this post to give a better insight to what
 DreamLab has achieved so far. While the results are far from being as much as those of F@H and BOINC, I think that ther
e are some interesting one. Do note that I do not have a technical background, I do not belong to any scientific team th
at worked on DreamLab projects, I'm just a user as you.

 Alzheimer's disease was on the list of research area on the old DRUGS projects, maybe some older users knows more than

Please notice that my research was definetely more focused on the DRUGS/CORONA-AI projects, so the results are d

I'm currently in the process of building a feature selection framework for reinforcement learning.

A. Here some previou

s://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1273496.1273589)

B. Context :

\--> I am experimenting with the non-continuous lunar lander 
environment using gym library. And I want to add two additional features that are introduced as random noise, incrementi
ng the observation space  to (8 + 2 ) = 10. I will then train my lunar lander using PPO algorithm, and use my feature se
lection framework to rank them and select the original 8 features, i.e excluding noise. (2 features.)

C. What do I need
 help with ?

\--> How should I be adding the noise ? Meaning what type of noise should be ideal for this ? I'm new to  
RL, and hence still learning.

D. What I have seen so far  on my own:

\--> After scouring some google searches on ' how
 to introduce noise in RL' lead me to other reddit posts, medium articles. I found that these lead me to the following t
opics :

1. Out-of-Distribution Detection in RL, Ex paper : [https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14990](https://arxiv.org/abs/200
4.14990), [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.02694.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.02694.pdf), [https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.4898
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.4898),
2. Introducing Noise for Exploration : [https://h2t.iar.kit.edu/pdf/Plappert2018.pdf

//arxiv.org/pdf/1706.10295.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.10295.pdf).

Some additional questions :

1. While searching 
for  'How to add NOISE in RL' opened me up to a whole new world of types of NOISE. My goal is to : a. add noise in my ob
servation space, b. possibly add a type of noise replicating real-world noise. (Most common ones I see are talking about
 Gaussian noise).
2. My feature selection framework accounts for implicit-state-reward dependency, similar to section A 
paper 1 linked above. The GOAL of my research is build algorithms to improve ROBUSTNESS, AND SAFETY for applicatIons usi
ng RL. Hence, building a custom feature selection framework is one of the first step towards it. PLEASE feel free to lin
k other open challenges in real-world RL applications, so I have the opportunity to address and work on them in my futur
e works.

Hey guys,

Im looking for a profile evaluation, and suggestions. I applied to PhD programs last cycle and was accepted t
o 2, which I turned down. Im applying this cycle again. My profile is pretty similar and so are my recommendations, so I
m not sure if I should have high hopes. Currently 3.8 GPA MS in CS student at a top 30 US University (by CS rankings for
 AI). 2 publications in robotics (IROS), 1 in NeurIPS this year (but I'm the 4th author), and 1 first author work under 
review at ICLR, one under review at  AAAI. 2 pretty strong recommendations, one from a faculty whose course I took and T
A'd for.

Im planning on applying to:
MILA, UNC Chapel Hill, CMU, NYU, USC, SFU, UCR, Virgina Tech, University of Washin
gton. 

One drawback of my profile is that I was enrolled as a PhD at my current uni, and didn't like the topic and didn
t find a good fit. So I've decided to apply elsewhere (finishing up as a MS at my current uni), but I think this negativ
ely impacts my applications because I thought I had a good profile but didn't get any interviews last year. Let me know 
what you think

```
I recently began my career as a Machine Learning Engineer, marking my first job in the industry. A few months ago, I com
pleted an MPhil program specializing in Environmental Engineering, with a research focus on applying ML in that field. T
hroughout my job search, I frequently encounter questions about my academic background. Additionally, utilizing ML techn
ologies has become increasingly convenient with the availability of user-friendly APIs.

&#x200B;

To enhance my competi
tiveness in the industry, I am looking to take proactive steps. I have been actively staying updated on ML technologies 
and trends, and now I am considering the following options:

1. As an independent researcher, try to publish papers in t
op conferences in the field like CVPR and NeurIPS.

2. Expand my knowledge in data engineering and MLops and work on end
-to-end personal projects.

&#x200B;

I understand that both of these options require a significant investment of time a
nd energy. Therefore, I wonder which option would be more worthwhile in terms of my time and effort. It is important to 
note that I am interested in working in the industry and do not intend to pursue a career in academia.

If anyone is interested in learning AI/LLM's and you’re more familiar with dotnet than python, take a look at my [NanoGp

 my project is very translatable to python. I also tried to never use the var keyword so you can have a better idea of w
hat's going on.

The NanoGpt project is only 600 lines of code, most of which are whitespace and comments, so don't hesi
tate to give it a look and let me know what you think!

all -  [ [D] Machine Learning PhD failure? Navigating the harsh reality of graduating without publications ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/17skp7j/d_machine_learning_phd_failure_navigating_the/) , 2023-12-10-0911

Hi ML community, 

I'm nearing the end of my three-year PhD journey. Throughout this period, I've dedicated myself to pr
oducing a research paper annually, targeting top-tier conferences like ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS. Despite my efforts and r
esubmissions, none of my papers made it through. As a result, my publication record consists solely of three manuscripts
 on arXiv.

My initial post-PhD ambition was to delve deeper into machine learning research at leading tech companies su
ch as Facebook, Google, or Microsoft. However, my applications were turned down, primarily due to the lack of publicatio
ns in prestigious conferences, which seems to be a crucial criterion for these roles.

Confronted with this setback and 
the pressing need to manage my finances, I shifted my focus to more traditional industry roles in consulting and finance
. I've recently secured a position in quant finance, which, while exciting, means I won't have the bandwidth to revisit 
and resubmit my research papers.

Reflecting on this journey, I sometimes feel disheartened, questioning the value of my
 PhD experience, especially when I consider my lack of published work in major machine learning conferences.

I see othe
r PhD students in my field publish 2 papers per year in these top conferences which makes me wonder whether I am a failu
re? I'm open to any thoughts or advice on my situation.

all -  [ Neurio - Still a viable Home Energy Monitoring Solution! ](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/17ryzw6/neurio_still_a_viable_home_energy_monitoring/) , 2023-12-10-0911

I've had the Neurio Home Energy Monitor (USA, Split Phase) for many, many years. Since they first came to the market, I 
was an early adapter. 
And it's been **rock solid**.

I just ordered another one for my cabin. (New in box from eBay, ab
out $60 after shipping (I set up scheduled alert, and low-balled a best offer)
I had it up and running in minutes. (Conn
ected to WiFi, registered to my existing cloud account, API enabled, and integrated in Home Assistant). 

Despite being 
vaporware and sold off to Generac and later abandoned, the API lives on,and the Home Assistant integration keeps working
. 
AND EVEN IF THEY DO KILL THE API (Aka, 'The MyQ treatment'), THERE IS STILL LOCAL ACCESS. (Which I don't use, YET)

*
*Existing Home Assistant integration:**  
https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/neurio_energy  
Two sensors will be
 created with the following names:   
* Energy Usage: Current active power usage in Watts. Updated every 10 seconds.   

* Daily Energy Usage: Daily power usage in kWh. Updated every 2.5 minutes.   

Polls via the cloud API (Which is still a
ctive!)  
https://api-docs.neur.io/#overview   

   
**Local Sensor Access:**  
JSON via IP:  
Example:   
http://192.16
8.1.xxxx/current-sample   
https://api-docs.neur.io/#sensor-local-access   
And in case the cloud doc ever goes missing,
 I've cloned it here: https://pastebin.com/raw/7YUCSzCe
   

Food for thought for those looking for an energy monitoring
 solution, but don't want to shell out a lot of money. 
I was about to pull the trigger on the 'DIY-ish' methods, but af
ter getting the board, CT sensors, etc, it will still going to cost at least $100. On top of that, forums are full of pe
ople struggling to set them up, calibrate them properly, etc.  I wasn't up for the task. I wanted a turn-key solution re
ady out of the box.
