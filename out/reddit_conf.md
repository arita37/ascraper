I am applying for fall 2024 for both MS and PhD in CS, with specialization in ML (NLP, Speech)

Nationality: Indian

Col
lege: top 10 in India 

CGPA: 9.8/10; CS Department rank 1

Research papers: Total 5. 2 in top speech conferences (like 
ICASSP; however speech conferencs are much less selective/reputable in comparison to say ICML, NeurIps), 1 in Comp biolo
gy journal (not sure of exact reputation but looked good to me), 2 in ML IEEE journals (international but pretty mediocr
e to the trained eye). 4 are 1st author, 1 is 3rd author.

LORs: 2 should be super strong; 1 should be strong

Work ex: 
1.5 years in ~FAANG.

Current shortlist:

PhD: MIT, UCB, UCL (London)

MS (research focused): MS CS Stanford, MLT CMU LT
I, MS CS UIUC, MS CS UT Austin, MS CS UW Madison.

Future goals: PhD if masters experience is good and I like living in 
academia in US, otherwise industry research position.

My current list is all quite ambitious and risky, but my philosop
hy is I should be happy/excited to get admission to the least favourite school in my list, otherwise no point.

Help nee
ded: Any suggestions for other excellent MS CS research focused masters (not professional masters) that I can add to abo
ve list? It's currently 8, I am planning to apply for a total of 10, so I need to decide 2 more. My current list of univ
ersities provide decent chance of landing funding in form of TA/RA, this is important to me and that's why I am avoiding
 UCSD, MS CS CMU, GATech, Columbia, NYU.

Hello. I am an international masters student in the US, applying for software engineering internships, but I haven't had

```
About to finish my PhD in a specific application of ML. The university is a pretty famous French institution, but withou
t much AI/ML prestige right now. I have a bunch of publications in industry specific conferences/journals, but no NeurIP
S/ICML/etc. After that, I'm going to work as an ML researcher for a startup which does some research and some product wo
rk.

In the long run, my ideal position would be something line a research scientist/engineer at an industry lab - I sti
ll want to do research, but definitely not in academia. DeepMind/Google, Meta, Anthropic and the likes would be perfect,
 with some preference for the first one.

What I'm looking for now is advice how to head towards that goal. As a PhD stu
dent I had - at least theoretically - a lot of flexibility in what I do, and if I got a few NeurIPS papers, I'd be golde
n. Now, I'll probably spend most of my time working on client products. This will certainly help me learn a lot and give
 many necessary skills, but that won't be as apparent on my resume.

So - how can I make sure that throughout working in
 a startup, I get stuff that will be appreciated by future, hopefully higher-profile employers, at least enough to get m
e through the resume screening stage?

Yann LeCun's stage comments were not well received, with suggestions that his next movie should focus on the dangers
 of closed-source AI [1]. LeCun also responded to a statement made by E.S. Yudkowsky regarding nuclear bombs and AI syst
ems, clarifying that AI systems do not self-replicate like nuclear bombs [16]. He further clarified that the discussion 
was about AI versus nuclear bombs, not nuclear energy, expressing his support for nuclear energy [17]. LeCun believes th
at AI is not the problem when it comes to misinformation on social networks, but rather the solution [20]. He is also an
nouncing an upcoming paper on information theory applied to Self-Supervised Learning at the NeurIPS conference [21][22].








Improving the quality of data is crucial for reliable AI, and this can be achieved using an open-source tool. Be
tter hardware and algorithms alone are not enough [2]. The author also believes that the basic AI infrastructure being o
pen source would prevent certain negative outcomes [14]. OpenAI has released a new skin for the OpenAI cookbook, an open
-source collection of examples and guides for building with the OpenAI API [8].







The cost of sequencing a human ge
nome has significantly decreased from over $300 million in 2001 to $200 today. Similar cost reduction curves can be expe
cted in the field of AI over the next 20 years [3].







Emad Mostaque, CEO of Stability AI, gave an insightful talk a
t the KPMG 2023 Tech & Innovation Symposium. He discussed the potential of Generative AI and offered an optimistic persp
ective on its dangers and risks [4]. He also discussed the potential of humans and computers working together, stating t
hat they will always surpass the capabilities of either humans or computers alone [5][6].







Hugging Face has introd
uced a new feature called Hugging Chat, which allows users to run the model directly in their browser using transformers
.js [7].







Google Research hosted a Research@ event in Mexico City featuring lightning talks and interactive demos 
on topics like Education, Science, Generative AI, and LLMs [9]. Google AI is seeking suggestions for topics to be explor
ed at future Research@ events [10].







AI has the potential to transform the way science is done by generating new r
esults and new ways to generate results. One approach is 'literature-based discovery' (LBD), which analyzes scientific l
iterature to make new discoveries. LBD systems have become more capable and are being used in fields like materials scie
nce [11]. Isomorphic Labs has been recognized as one of the most promising early-stage companies in biotech for its work
 in using AI to reimagine the drug discovery process [13].







Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of Google DeepMind and cu
rrent head of Inflection AI, believes that the future of AI lies in Interactive AI, which is artificial intelligence tha
t can react in conversation, interact with other systems, and take actions based on high-level goals [12]. Suleyman also
 envisions a future where AI assistants act as personal 'chiefs of staff' and have the ability to make decisions and ent
er into contracts on behalf of their users [19].







The author, Andrej Karpathy, discusses the limitations of machin
e learning models in understanding knowledge. He mentions that their understanding is 'patchy' and lacks intuition [15].
 The author argues that poorly designed ranking algorithms can make people addicted or depressed, even without the use o
f AI. However, AI can be beneficial in creating ranking results that are interesting, non-addictive, and non-depressing 
[18].

Hi Everyone,

I am a phd student and I am about to graduate very soon. I have a paper accepted to a machine learning con
ference (NeurIPS) this year. But I am not sure if I should attend it. The main discouraging reasons are: 1) it may take 
20 hours or more than 30 hours for me to get to the conference in new orleans (plus I still need to apply for a visa to 
US); 2) my work is done during my internship at a company but the company won't reimburse ex-interns, and by the time th
e conference starts I will be graduated from the university already. The overall trip costs over $3000 dollars. 

On the
 other hand, attending this conference may help me landing an industry job as so many companies will be there. While I h
ave other top conference papers in the past few years, I couldn't attend any conference in person due to COVID. 

Will y
ou attend the conference in this case?

```
Hello everyone

I have a doubt regarding GANs for tabular data, more specifically for time-series generation. Looking at
 the TimeGAN [paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/c9efe5f26cd17ba6216bbe2a7d26d490-Paper.p
df) ([code](https://github.com/jsyoon0823/TimeGAN)) and other implementations such as the one by [YData](https://github.
com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic/blob/dev/examples/timeseries/TimeGAN_Synthetic_stock_data.ipynb), considering that the train
ing dataset is divided into slices (like a rolling window) of N length and that the generated sequence will follow the s
ame format, that is `[batch size, N, n_features]`, what we are effectively generating are slices and not a fully synthet
ic time-series.

&#x200B;

To clarify my question, the output of a TimeGAN is only a set of slices, although there is no
 guarantee that generated slice(N-1) is the one before slice(N), and so the true use of a TimeGAN is generating slices t
hat can be used to train a predictive TS model but not reconstructing a complete time series like the one used for train
ing.

&#x200B;

I suspect that's the case (useful only to generate good slices for training predictive models) as there 
is no fully generated time series in the paper or any of the codes, while the quality of the generated data is partially
 measured by training a model on original data and generated data and comparing their predictive performance. If anyone 
can confirm/develop upon these thoughts I would be extremely grateful.

There is so
 much noise in the reviews every year. Some good work that the authors are proud of might get rejected because of the no
isy system, given that NeurIPS is growing so large these years. We should keep in mind that the work is still valuable n
o matter what the final result is.

&#x200B;

Choices:

**Dream:**  MCS@UIUC

**Ambitious:**  MSCS@USC (CS32 thesis), MSCS@NYU Courant, MSCS@TAMU, MEN

**Moderate:** MSCS@Tandon, MCS@UMass, MENG@UCLA

**Safe:** MC
S@NEU SV, MENG@Waterloo ECE (non co-op)

&#x200B;

Would it be an over- or under-estimation? Please feel free to suggest
 more programs/schools.

Given that spring applications are still open, I'm also trying for the spring deadlines in Sep/
Oct, if it has less severe competition. Since I primarily wish for research based, so having less internships does not a
ffect much.

```
As the title suggests, I'm currently pursuing a CS PhD in China. However, I'm considering a different career path and ha
ve decided to mastering out to pursue a PhD in the US. I'm aiming for a top 10-20 school in the field of computer scienc
e, but I'm not sure if my profile is competitive enough. I have 2-3 papers published in venues like NeurIPS and ICLR, as
 well as work experience. However, I feel I lack strong references, particularly from the US. I've heard that recommenda
tion letters are as important as qualifications.

Therefore, I'm considering delaying my grad application for at least s
ix months. During this time, I plan to visit a renowned lab to gain more experience and connect with professors who coul
d write me recommendation letters. I've sent out 3-4 cold emails to professors who I believe would be a good fit. In the
se emails, I expressed my interest in working with them and briefly outlined my research plans. I also mentioned that I 
could self-fund my visit if necessary. The emails are quite long, usually 200-300 words. As for now I have yet received 
any response from them.

Do you think it's off-putting to directly ask about the possibility of a self-funded visit with
out prior conversations? Which might appear that I am quite desperate.

Several non-parametric methods such as nearest neighbor, Parzen windows, and kernel methods
 are discussed, but they suffer from the curse of dimensionality [1]. Yann LeCun and François Vallet were colleagues in 
1991, with Vallet using LeCun's neural net simulator called HLM starting from 1986 [2].







California Governor Gavin
 Newsom has signed an executive order to study the development, use, and risks of generative artificial intelligence, a 
significant step towards potentially regulating this rapidly growing technology [3].







Stability AI has launched St
able Audio, their first AI product for music and sound generation, allowing users to create music with AI for free [4]. 
Stable Audio uses generative AI techniques to deliver faster and higher-quality music and sound effects through a user-f
riendly web interface [5]. Stability AI has partnered with Audiosparx, a leading music library, to curate a new model [6
]. However, due to high demand, their servers are currently at full capacity [11].







AIVF, an Israeli start-up, has
 developed an AI tool that selects the most viable embryo for implantation during IVF, increasing the chances of a healt
hy pregnancy by up to 30% [8]. OpenAI stores user data for 30 days, allows its employees to access the data, and may sha
re it with other services [9].







The author transitioned from building web applications to focusing on Machine Lear
ning systems, learning valuable skills while using Upwork [10]. LLM output validation is important to ensure the reliabi
lity and predictability of generative AI applications, with Guardrails AI introduced as a tool for implementing it [12].








Replit has introduced a new tool called Replit ModelFarm, which allows users to build Generative AI apps quickly
 and securely [15]. The tool is currently available for free on Hacker and Pro plans until October 15th [20]. Kraftful h
as developed a plugin for ChatGPT called the product coach, providing assistance with various product-related questions 
and tasks [21].







Apple is poised to become the leading AI company globally, with their advancements in hardware an
d the impressive capabilities of their ChatGPT competitor, Ajax [22]. Auto-regressive language models (LLMs) cannot plan
 or reason effectively, according to Yann LeCun [23].







Google AI hosted Research@ Accra in Ghana, featuring lightn
ing talks and interactive demos on various important topics [18]. Google AI has announced that the NeurIPS Unlearning Co
mpetition is now open for submissions on Kaggle [28].







OpenAI has announced the opening of a new office in Dublin,
 Ireland, to better serve the European market [30].

```
As a professional in the field, I've always targeted SIGKDD for publishing applied DS/ML work. I think SIGKDD is the top
 and most reputable in particular for industry practitioners, as opposed to academic researchers, who focus more on nove
lty and therefore aim for NeurIPS or ICML. This is thanks to the Applied-Data-Science track in SIGKDD which scopes deplo
yed systems and domain specific applications, rather than purely novel discoveries.

My question is whether there are ot
her \*\*reputable\*\* conferences similar to KDD in this sense and allow for publishing?

Hi everyone,

I am a research scientist working in one of the FAANG companies in the US. I did my undergrad and PhD in t
he UK (both at Oxford/Cambridge). I've worked a while for my current employer but got a bit fed up with the Bay Area & b
ecause of personal reasons I want to move back to the UK, either via an internal transfer (my company has a large resear
ch presence in the UK) or, if that's not possible, finding a new job. I got my eyes on the global talent programme, and 
since I will most likely be working as a researcher in industry rather than academia, I don't think any of the fast-trac
k routes would apply and 'peer review' (in my case through RAEng) seems to be the only choice. I've not seen many data p
oints on how high the bar is through this route (unlike the US EB-1 route, where tons of data are available), though, so
 I think it's a good idea to gather wisdom from Reddit to see how likely I'll be granted that visa, before more commitme
nt like getting a lawyer. Any advice is extremely appreciated!

&#x200B;

**About me:**

\- integrated masters & PhD wit
h scholarship in AI/ML (Oxbridge)

\- 1-2 yr work experience at one of the major US tech companies (think Alphabet / Met
a / Amazon) in California

\- \~20 papers (first/co-first author in half of them); around 15 published in top conference
s (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR/ACL etc. if you are familiar with AI/ML venues)  & journals -- note that in Computer science in gen
eral, conferences are the primary venue in contrast to journals. I have also served as a peer reviewer in these venues (
reviewed >50 papers).

\- \~400 citations according to Google Scholar, although half of the papers are published fairly 
recently (<1 year) -- hopefully citations will catch up later.

\- Good chance of getting a recommendation letter from s
ome big guy (think a Fellow of RAEng level) at my old lab in the UK.

\- Have been and will still be active in research 
(publishing papers, etc.) even though I'm working in the industry.

&#x200B;

A side question is: it seems that getting 
sponsored by RAEng would allow me to get ILR in 3 years even under 'exceptional promise' -- would that be true in my cas
e as well, even though I'm not conducting research in academia?

&#x200B;

Thanks, everyone!

 I'm curious to learn about the perception of papers published in the NeurIPS dataset track in comparison to those publi
shed in the main conference. Specifically, I'd like to know how both companies and Ph.D. committees view these papers. A
re they considered equally valuable, or is there a notable difference in their reputation and significance? Your insight
s and experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Hello! I’ve been working a bit over a year in trading and now looking to fulfill my dream of getting a PhD and focusing 
purely on research. Would love to get some feedback on how realistic the schools I’m looking at are given my background.


School:
US T15, 3.8 GPA, Major in CS + Math

Research (ML related):
2nd author in a Neurips workshop
2nd author in a N
ature Journal
1st author poster presentation at a small workshop

Awards:
Putnam top 500

Work:
1 internship at FAANG
1 
internship in trading
currently in trading FT

Rec letters:
research advisor (good), work manager (good), professor (wea
k)

(US Citizen)

1. Given my summers were spent interning in the industry rather than doing research, will this notably
 impact my application negatively?

2. Obviously I’d like to go to Stanford/CMU/MIT/Berkeley, but how are my odds given 
other competing applicants probably have all summers spent on research? (I can verify the labs there have interesting+re
levant work I’d like to be a part of)

3. Is it perhaps better to apply for a research based MS programs instead to get 
better research experience and stronger rec letters?
