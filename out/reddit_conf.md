```
Last year I applied to 10 CS PhD programs in the US with a focus on machine learning at Stanford, Columbia, CMU, Harvard
, UMaryland, UCSD (both CS and DS PhD), Duke, UCI, UNC Chapel Hill and UIUC with zero papers but 2 years of research exp
erience. Still, I was devastated to get rejected from all of them as I did my research and applied to targeted profs onl
y whose research I was familiar with. I didn’t take GRE and as I mentioned I had zero accepted papers but 3 under submis
sion.

I was pretty low on energy for most of the first half of the year but put myself back together to apply to some m
asters program at Germany — Tubingen and Saarland and got accepted in both of them.

Current research profile:
—————————
————
And fortunately recently one of my papers got accepted at UAI 2023 and I visited the conference as well with some p
otential collaboration opportunities ahead. So after a year my profile looks like this:
 - 1 accepted paper at UAI
 - 1 
under submission at NeurIPS with scores 4,5,4,6,4 (looks like a reject)
 - 1 book chapter in Springer (to be published)

(all relevant to the area I want to do my PhD in)
 - currently doing some stuff on LLMs but doesn’t look like it will be
 in a publishable shape by the application deadlines
 - I do have 5/6 US patents filed, not sure if they are helpful as 
I heard mixed opinions 

My background:
—————————
 - Undergrad in electrical engineering from a top 5 IIT in India with 
GPA 9.15/10.

My letter writers are research scientists at industry with PhDs from US (they know me over 2 years) and on
e IIT professor (also with PhD from US, worked with him for 3 months in an internship).

Question:
—————
I am now vacill
ating between whether to go with the offer at Tubingen or Saarland, or take another shot at the US PhD programs this yea
r. If I need to point out 1 mistake that cost me heavily last year, I would say it’s that I didn’t contact potential sup
ervisors that aggressively but many of them wrote that no need to contact them beforehand! On asking why rejected despit
e being a good match, one prof replied my profile was rated highly but I had “less publications” than others and also di
dn’t submit GRE score (it was optional, I mean wtf)!

I plan to start mailing now and have some meetings next week (one 
with a prof that rejected me last year!) Probably I would take GRE too this time.

Now on the other side, I have enough 
savings to last 1-2 years in Germany, but I would be much better off with a scholarship or stipend that I won’t have in 
the beginning there. I don’t want to break all my FDs and stock market investments!

What do you think? I am scared to a
pply and get rejected all over again, and also a bit anxious to go to Germany without any scholarship or financial assis
tance.

This years Neurips has been a rollercoaster for everyone involved.

Petar Veličković says that in their AC batch 65% sub
mitted no rebuttal or withdrew.

```
Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I come from a robotics background (bachelor + half of my masters), however, at the end of my mas
ters, I shifted towards learning theory by taking lectures on a variety of subjects such as deep learning theory, statis
tical learning, computer vision, etc. 

&#x200B;

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in the intersection of learning theory 
and computer vision, my research work revolves around compressing neural network models, reducing their complexity and t
esting them on vision tasks (classification mostly, but sometimes extended to segmentation and object detection).

My go
-to conferences are typically CVPR, NeurIPS, ICLR...However, my supervisors and I want to try out a robotics conference,
 and my question is, which one to prefer in my case ? Knowing that I do not experiment on real robots. Is my work more s
uited for IROS or ICRA? Any other conference suggestion?

&#x200B;

Thank you for your answers.

Greetings fellow researchers,

I am 27, currently working remotely at a healthcare IT company based in Silicon Valley  (
6+ years in industrial research) where I apply deep learning methods and large language models. I recently received an e
xciting opportunity to pursue a PhD at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in a similar research area. 

While I a
m grateful for my current position and compensation, Have published in NeurIPS, EMNLP, ACL, ACM etc (NLP) with really go
od citations under company. I feel unsatisfied with the learning opportunities available in company & industry.

I am st
rongly considering pursuing the DTU PhD program full-time, but wanted to get perspectives from others before making a de
cision. How strong is DTU's AI research community?

 Given the rapid advances in large language models, is now an ideal 
time to immerse myself in academic research? There are many topics that interest me, including fairness, ethics, halluci
nations, quantization, specialized domains like healthcare/finance, and federated learning combined with LLMs.

Would ap
preciate any insights on whether moving into academia would be a wise choice at this stage versus remaining in industry.
 I welcome any suggestions or considerations I should keep in mind. 

Thank you for taking the time to share your though
ts!

I as a researcher observed some researchers use dual accounts (using different email ids) in Openreview website primaril
y ICLR or NeurIPS. One hypothesis I heard is it helps in review with one email and submit using other email ID. Is this 
permitted ? I could see as a disclaimer written in OpenReview website that irrespective how many email id's you may have

NeurIPS 2023 paper reviews are visible on OpenReview.  See this [tweet](https://twitter.com/francoisfleuret/status/16864

se.

There is so much noise in the reviews every year. Some good work that the authors are proud of might get a low scor
e because of the noisy system, given that NeurIPS is growing so large these years. We should keep in mind that the work 
is still valuable no matter what the score is.

Hi there, 

I am a student at Mathematical Modelling and Computation at Technical University of Denmark. I would like to
 attend the Machine Learning Summer School in 2024 ([http://mlss.cc/](http://mlss.cc/)). 

The Machine Learning Summer S
chool has as admission requirement that I provide an extended abstract on: 'A project reproducing the results of a paper
 published by someone else in a top conference or journal in ML or applied ML (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, EC
CV, AAAI, ACL, EMNLP, TPAMI, JMLR, Nature, Nature Communications, Science, Science Advances, PNAS) in the past 3 years.'


Would anyone out there like to join forces and see if we can find an interesting paper in one of the mentioned journal
s/proceedings and then reproduce their results? I am mainly interested in time series and image recognition, but I am op
en for suggestions. 

Also, if you have any ideas about good approaches to this project, I am all ears. I have found it 
a bit overwhelming to find a suitable paper.

Hope to hear from you :).

So for the past six months I have been working on a domain adaptation research problem. I wanted to inspect/understand t

ntains the implementations of all published SSL methods, This made things very easy for me in terms of writing code. I a
m not a PhD student or don't have significant research experience. My guide/mentor is very interested in the work I'm do
ing and she aims to publish our work in somewhere like a NeurIPS, ICML or so.

Probably because of my lack of experience
, I am overlooking into things or I am genuinely concerned. I just don't want to make stupid coding or code related erro
