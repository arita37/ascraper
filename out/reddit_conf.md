Hi, I'm applying for MS programs in the US for this cycle. This is my profile -

CGPA: 9.22 (Tier 1), B.E. CSE.

Researc
h Papers : 3 arXivs as of now, 1 reproduction under review at a bad journal, 1 Small paper, which I will submit to a Neu
rIPS workshop and 1 big paper under review at ACCV (CORE B). I might be able to get another small paper at a NeurIPS wor
kshop.

Internship experience : 
1. Summer research through DAAD WISE. Decent work, this might go for a good journal lat
er.
2. Current internship with an OpenSource community (remote).

LORs : I have 3 strong LORs, 2 from BITS (I have been 
a topper in both of the prof's classes, have been a TA and have been working on research projects with them, they know m
e very well), 1 from my internship advisor in Germany. 1 more Moderate LOR from an internship I am doing right now.

GRE
 : 323 (168Q, 155V), not planning to give it again. Yet to give TOEFL.

Extra : Have a lot of TAship experience, Head of
 the AI club here, organized several events, have won a small research talk event as well. Active on GitHub (?). One Blo
gPost acceptance at an ICML workshop.

Universities:
Note that, I also have a Full Time offer in hand, so I'm only apply
ing to top universities.

CMU MS ML, Stanford MS DS, Princeton MSE CS, UCLA MS CS, UCSD MS DS, Columbia MS CS, UW Madiso
n MS CS, UPenn MS CIS, UT Austin MS CS.


I would also like to know if I have a chance at these universities, or should 
I go a little below, but I really don't want to apply below T20 as then I can just continue my job here for a year and t
hen go.

Thanks.

all -  [ Yurtdışı - Türkiye ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CodingTR/comments/1evhsx5/yurtdışı_türkiye/) , 2024-08-23-0911
```
Selam herkese,

Üç temel sorum olacak, fikirlerinizi gerçekten merak ediyorum. (TLDR aşağıda)

Bu sene UK'de Data Scienc
e master'ı yapacağım (top 100 bir okul), bilgisayar mühendisliğinden yeni mezun oldum fakat 2 seneye yakın sektörde iş t
ecrübem var. Hali hazırda Türkiye'de bir işim var ve memur maaşı seviyesinde bir maaş alıyorum. Master'dan sonra UK ya d
a Amerika'da 1-2 sene çalışıp hem okul masrafını karşılayıp hem de biraz tecrübe edinip, çok ısınamazsam dönerim temel p
lanımdı. Fakat genel olarak ne daha mantıklı hiç kafamda oturtamadığını farkettim. Yurtdışına 'alışsam' bile FAANG tarzı
 çok büyük firmalarda çalışmadıktan sonra Türkiye'den remote çalışmanın (2.5-3.5k$ net aylık) yurtdışında nereden baksam
 (4-6k$ net aylık) orta-üst arası net bir maaşa eşit olduğunu düşünüyorum (olay sadece para değil biliyorum iş/yaşam koş
ulları olarak da konuşabiliriz). Açıkçası bunun üstünde maaşlar da hele şuan sektördeki rekabeti ve piyasayı düşününce g
özüme zor geliyor. Günün sonunda aynı parayı biriktirebileceksem de yurtdışında birkaç sene durup alışmadıysam dönmek da
ha mantıklı geliyor. Ama sizce maaşlar 'gerçek anlamda' daha fazla olur mu yurtdışında ya da TR'den remote iş kovalamak 
da bir o kadar imkansız mı? UK'de net olarak ayda 7-8k$ alabileceğim senior pozisyonlar var ama (çok rekabetçi) öte yand
an bir dairenin kirası neredeyse 2.5k$ Londra'da. Amerika'da da gidip Seattle, SF falan yaşadığımda da aynı şeyler olaca
k. Yani bana şöyle geliyor: ultra yüksek maaş skalası ve pahalı yer, yüksek maaş ama pahalı yer, ortalama maaş ve ortala
ma masraf, yurtdışında seçeneklerim bunlarmış gibi. Ve FAANG hariç diğer seçenekler mantıksızmış gibi hissediyorum. FAAN
G tarzı bir yer için de biraz kafayı kırıp çok ekstra çalışmak lazım sanırım. Üniversitenin başından beri kendimi gelişt
irmeye çalışıyorum, 3. sınıfta işe girdim, mezun olmadan tam zamanlı çalışmaya başladım. Benden çok çok iyi pozisyon ve 
maaşlarda başlayan arkadaşlarım da var benden kötü olanları da var ama günün sonunda ben elimdekinden çok memnun değilim
 hep sıkı çalıştım, dereceyle iyi bir üniversiteden mezun oldum fakat günün sonunda elimde olan sadece bir 'memur maaşı'
. Master'dan sonra belki Türkiye'de hayalimdeki maaşları yine alamayacağım, yurtdışında da aynı şekilde (sektör malum). 
Master'da NeurIPS tarzı yerlerde paper kovalayıp ya da sağlam projeler yapıp son bir sağlam koşu yapmam gerekiyor gibi h
issediyorum bu konuda ne düşünüyorsunuz? Ve siz genel olarak sektördeki rekabete karşı ne yapıyorsunuz?

  
TLDR:

1) Si
zce Türkiye ile Yurtdışında yazılımcı olarak çalışmak için (default olarak Türkiye'de yaşamanın size daha tercih edilebi
lir geldiğini varsayalım) ne tür farklar olmalı maaş ve iş koşulları açısından?

2) Üniversiteden/Yazılım'a ilk atıldığı
 süreden beri çok sıkı çalışıp istediğini alamadığını düşünen ya da çok çalışıp istediğini aldığını düşünen arkadaşlar s
ektördeki rekabet ve bir sonraki kariyer adımlarınız hakkında ne düşünüyorsunuz?

3) Sizce biraz çalışmaktan yorulmuş ol
mama rağmen kendimi motive edip NeurIPS tarzı yerlerde makale yayınlatabilmek için sıkı çalışmalı mıyım? Bu tarz makalel
er büyük şirketlerde Research Engineer olarak işe girmekte çok büyük + sağlıyor.

The NeurIPS rebuttal period is finally over. How is everyone’s review? 

I had the worst experience ever with one review
er. For the initial comments, he/she only wrote a short paragraph asking a bunch of questions that can be easily answere
d by the content of the paper, then put a score of 3 and a confidence of 4. For the rebuttal, this reviewer gave contrad
ictory statements, and can’t even understand the difference between training data and testing data. I spent two good day
s explaining the difference. Finally, the reviewer left an incorrect statement about the paper and disappeared. Typical 
reviewer 2.

```
There's been a lot of talk about genAI, but most of it has been hand wavy. Imo, there's only a few things GenAI is usefu
l for. Communications, making decisions (reading PDFs, emails, etc and triggering actions), and insights (+ transforming
 large amounts of data into human readable text).

I'm trying to build something of value with Endflow which aims to be 
the AI hub for material procurement insights and actions. What it does:

1. Automation: Removes a lot of manual parts of
 the end-to-end purchase order process. Such as automated follow up schedules for open POs, matching invoice to PO to pa
cking slip, grief rack RCA, creating evidence-backed AI vendor scorecards, etc.
2. Insights: When you should consider re
placing a vendor, POs we deem as at risk, parts consolidation and volume discounts, other supply chain risks, etc.
3. Da
ta: Keeps your ERP/Excel clean and up to date which keeps the demand forecast accurate.

I previously ran a manufacturin
g services business as well being on the founding AI team of a couple startups (including at AutoGPT) and publishing AI 
research at the largest US AI conference (NeurIPS). I'm now trying to combine the two into a product that adds genuine v
alue.

Curious to get get your thoughts/feedback! Please lmk if you have questions & call me out if you have concerns :)

```
Although I have papers in some top venues (IJCAI, ACL, etc.), I tend to receive poor reviews initially, leading to a cyc
le of resubmissions before finally getting accepted. While some reviews at top conferences can be really poor, I can't b
lame everything on the reviewers. Since receiving the NeurIPS reviews this year, I've been reflecting on what I can impr
ove in my approach to avoid these frustrating cycles of resubmission.

My reviewers often mention that my papers read we
ll and are easy to follow, but they aren't impressed by the novelty. I understand that since I don't work with LLMs or o
ther trendy topics, reviewers usually don't seem to grasp the importance of the task I'm working on or the method itself
.

In improving my approach, I want to start with the figures. I usually use [draw.io](http://draw.io), but this often r
esults in unimpressive figures, reminiscent of those seen in papers from the 2000s. What tools are you all using to crea
te more polished figures? I understand that a tool is just a medium for expression and shouldn't limit what I want to ac
hieve, but I still want to know how you make good figures that encapsulate your work concisely and give reviewers a bett
er understanding of what you're doing.

NeurIPS 2024 paper reviews are supposed to be released today. I thought to create a discussion thread for us to discuss 
any issue/complain/celebration or anything else.

There is so much noise in the reviews every year. Some good work that 
the authors are proud of might get a low score because of the noisy system, given that NeurIPS is growing so large these
 years. We should keep in mind that the work is still valuable no matter what the score is.

Does anyone know when the reviews will be released? The NeurIPS website states that the rebuttal starts on July 30th any
where on Earth, and it’s already July 30th in our time zone!

Hello!

For those who would be interested in taking part in weather forecasting challenge I would like to let you know a
bout the [~Weather4cast 2024~ ](https://weather4cast.net/)[~Challenge~ ](https://weather4cast.net/)that we are organisin
g at the NeurIPS 2024 Competition Track.

The competition focuses on topics of high impact and practical value for our s
ociety – predicting future weather and changes of our environment. We provide satellite and radar data covering most of 
the Europe and we ask the participants to develop models that could predict extreme precipitation events.

This year, on
 the road to foundation models, **we move from basic rainfall prediction to testing generalisation performance and emerg
ent capabilities of probabilistic models** on a set of downstream tasks, such as cumulative rainfall and the prediction 
of rare extreme weather events. We provide an order of magnitude more hi-resolution data for training on multiple scales
.

To solve the competition task you will need to apply spatio-temporal modelling to complex dynamic systems and demonst
rate the  temporal and spatial transfer learning of your models under strong distributional shifts! Finally, you will ad
dress a super-resolution challenge where you need to predict future hi-res rain radar of ground-based weather stations f
rom broader satellite sensor images!

I compiled a spreadsheet of
 all papers from the ICLR, ICML, and NeurIPS conferences. It only contains data from 2023 (+ 2024 for ICLR). Thought it 
might be useful to someone else as well.

Contains the following columns (title, authors, abstract, and conference are a
lways filled in, others not):

|Title|Authors|Abstract|Conference|pdf|Poster|Slides|OpenReview|JMLR|

I reviewed the video clip, but it only covers a small fraction of the explanation we need. Are you looking for this spec
ific one, or should we dive into another? I'm excited to get your input and move forward with this
