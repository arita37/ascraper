There's been a lot of talk about genAI, but most of it has been hand wavy. Imo, there's only a few things GenAI is usefu
l for. Communications, making decisions (reading PDFs, emails, etc and triggering actions), and insights (+ transforming
 large amounts of data into human readable text).

I'm trying to build something of value with Endflow which aims to be 
the AI hub for material procurement insights and actions. What it does:

1. Automation: Removes a lot of manual parts of
 the end-to-end purchase order process. Such as automated follow up schedules for open POs, matching invoice to PO to pa
cking slip, grief rack RCA, creating evidence-backed AI vendor scorecards, etc.
2. Insights: When you should consider re
placing a vendor, POs we deem as at risk, parts consolidation and volume discounts, other supply chain risks, etc.
3. Da
ta: Keeps your ERP/Excel clean and up to date which keeps the demand forecast accurate.

I previously ran a manufacturin
g services business as well being on the founding AI team of a couple startups (including at AutoGPT) and publishing AI 
research at the largest US AI conference (NeurIPS). I'm now trying to combine the two into a product that adds genuine v
alue.

Curious to get get your thoughts/feedback! Please lmk if you have questions & call me out if you have concerns :)

l for. Communications, making decisions (reading PDFs, emails, etc and triggering actions), and insights (+ transforming

I'm applying the technology with [https://endflow.com](https://endflo
w.com) which is the AI hub for material procurement insights and actions. What Endflow does;

1. Automation: Removes a l
ot of manual parts of the end-to-end purchase order process. Such as ensuring PO confirmation and handling discrepancies
, automated following up schedules for open POs, matching invoice to PO to packing slip, grief rack RCA, creating eviden
ce-backed AI vendor scorecards, etc. Benefits are not just reducing errors and manual work, but also shortening PO cycle
, reducing vendor and production delay risk, and improving visibility. 
2. Insights: From this data we can notify you wh
en you should consider replacing/meeting with a vendor (ex. high lead time variance and low timeliness). Others include 
any POs we deem as at risk, saving money based on parts consolidation and volume discounts, other supply chain risks, et
c.
3. Data: Keeps your ERP/Excel clean and up to date which keeps the demand forecast accurate. No surprise emails that 
slip through the cracks because we monitor your inbox with AI.

all -  [ [D] How to make figures for your paper? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1er14hq/d_how_to_make_figures_for_your_paper/) , 2024-08-16-0911
```
Although I have papers in some top venues (IJCAI, ACL, etc.), I tend to receive poor reviews initially, leading to a cyc
le of resubmissions before finally getting accepted. While some reviews at top conferences can be really poor, I can't b
lame everything on the reviewers. Since receiving the NeurIPS reviews this year, I've been reflecting on what I can impr
ove in my approach to avoid these frustrating cycles of resubmission.

My reviewers often mention that my papers read we
ll and are easy to follow, but they aren't impressed by the novelty. I understand that since I don't work with LLMs or o
ther trendy topics, reviewers usually don't seem to grasp the importance of the task I'm working on or the method itself
.

In improving my approach, I want to start with the figures. I usually use [draw.io](http://draw.io), but this often r
esults in unimpressive figures, reminiscent of those seen in papers from the 2000s. What tools are you all using to crea
te more polished figures? I understand that a tool is just a medium for expression and shouldn't limit what I want to ac
hieve, but I still want to know how you make good figures that encapsulate your work concisely and give reviewers a bett
er understanding of what you're doing.

So I am looking for a company to do my Master research project at. I was looking at Sony but of course they have extreme

But do a

The description said MS/PhD so
 ofc that is where the 'papers published' came from, but I am still curious.

Is Unlimited Context Length really possible?  At what cost?

 will describe the architecture and take questions at this Friday's [Oxen.ai](http://Oxen.ai) Paper Club.

NeurIPS 2024 paper reviews are supposed to be released today. I thought to create a discussion thread for us to discuss 
any issue/complain/celebration or anything else.

There is so much noise in the reviews every year. Some good work that 
the authors are proud of might get a low score because of the noisy system, given that NeurIPS is growing so large these
 years. We should keep in mind that the work is still valuable no matter what the score is.

Does anyone know when the reviews will be released? The NeurIPS website states that the rebuttal starts on July 30th any
where on Earth, and it’s already July 30th in our time zone!

```
Hello!

For those who would be interested in taking part in weather forecasting challenge I would like to let you know a
bout the [~Weather4cast 2024~ ](https://weather4cast.net/)[~Challenge~ ](https://weather4cast.net/)that we are organisin
g at the NeurIPS 2024 Competition Track.

The competition focuses on topics of high impact and practical value for our s
ociety – predicting future weather and changes of our environment. We provide satellite and radar data covering most of 
the Europe and we ask the participants to develop models that could predict extreme precipitation events.

This year, on
 the road to foundation models, **we move from basic rainfall prediction to testing generalisation performance and emerg
ent capabilities of probabilistic models** on a set of downstream tasks, such as cumulative rainfall and the prediction 
of rare extreme weather events. We provide an order of magnitude more hi-resolution data for training on multiple scales
.

To solve the competition task you will need to apply spatio-temporal modelling to complex dynamic systems and demonst
rate the  temporal and spatial transfer learning of your models under strong distributional shifts! Finally, you will ad
dress a super-resolution challenge where you need to predict future hi-res rain radar of ground-based weather stations f
rom broader satellite sensor images!
