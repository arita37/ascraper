Long story short, this year NeurIPS in a paper which I am not really associated with, the co-authors got into a huge fig
ht about author ordering, and one of them threatens to withdraw the submission. I'm just curious if a withdrew submissio
n on OpenReview is able to be restored and returns to the regular review process once the withdrawal button is clicked. 
The paper now has all the review rebutalled.

**Tldr:** As I am about start my MS (in about a week's time), I need to pick collaborators/mentors to do research and
 publish papers with. **I want to maximize my chances of getting into a top AI PhD program like MIT, Berkeley, etc.** To
 that end, should I do research with people I've already have a relationship with? Should I aim to maintain those connec
tions (in hopes of receiving a glowing recommendation in the future)? Or should I end those collaborations and try to fo
rm new connections with different professors who are more 'reputed' and/or well-connected to top universities like Princ
eton, Berkeley etc.?? For context I go to a top 15 school **in USA**.

**Situation #1:** Over the summer I did a researc
h engineering gig with a scientist at my university. Not a professor, a 'scientist.' We worked on object detection for s
elf-driving cars. I enjoyed the experience and found him to be a very knowledgeable, constructive, and approachable ment
or. The conversations we have sometimes are almost like two friends talking. I've developed a good relationship with him
 and he has praised my capabilities and motivation. **However:** he isn't a very 'reputed' researcher in the field- at l
east not compared to professors at my university. After all, his job isn't to publish full-time, but rather to deliver M
L-based products for government agencies. And so, my work with him wasn't to conduct 'research', it was more about doing
 literature review and implementing existing approaches. More of a 'research engineering' gig.

**My question:** Should 
I reach out to actual professors at my university working in ML and computer vision? They publish more papers, and they 
are better connected to top-universities like Berkeley. Although I have never worked with these professors, I will also 
have the opportunity to take there courses so I can develop a relationship with them. Or, should I collaborate further w
ith the scientist? The thing is, since I didn't do real 'research' with him over the summer, we will be essentially **st
arting from scratch** and working on some entirely new problems. The only advantage is he is already familiar with who I
 am and definitely has a favorable view of me. I am leaning towards the professor, because I feel like since I only work
ed with the scientist for a few months, I'm not losing much in terms of the relationship.

**Situation #2: Let's forget 
about the scientist now, this is a different person.** I reached to a full-time professor (not even associate professor,
 he is a full professor, and my school is top 15). He is a senior member of IEEE. He also has quite a few publications a
t top conferences like ICML, NeurIPS etc. Thus it is safe to say he is a well-reputed researcher. Although my connection
 with this professor is not as strong as the above-described self-driving scientist, he thinks I have a good background,
 and we have agreed to collaborate over the Fall during my MS. I have done some basic preparatory work over the summer (
reading background papers etc.). Additionally, I will most likely take courses that he teaches at my university, so I wi
ll get to connect with him better.

**My question:** Should I cancel this collaboration and try to work with a different
 (associate) professor who studied at Princeton and did his postdoc at Berkeley? My thinking is that he's very well-conn
ected so his recommendation letter might mean a lot/open doors for me. Only problem is I don't know what I would tell th
e professor I've already agreed to work with...

ICML 2023 was my first trial. I've got polarized scores, 7/6/4/3, and got rejected. At this moment, I was so disappointe
d not for the result, but for the quality of review. (The last reviewer didn't read the paper at all.) For the final dec
ision, the last review was so bad as well, not presenting any reason of rejection.

With the same topic, I got 6/5/5/4/4
/3 from the NeurIPS 2023. The quality of reviewer is much better than ICML, and I've learned many things from the review
er, though they said the score will not be changed.

I think I should submit it to another conference again, ICLR or CVP
R. I just wonder how many submissions are tried for the acceptance in average. Just for reference.

I've been working on a specific project for a while now, and was interested in submitting my work to a Nips Workshop.

N
ow, I had a look at the Nips submission guidelines, they remain the same for the workshop except the page limit for main
 content is 6 pages instead of 9. I tried going over the Nips latex style, but feel pretty intimidated by the sheer amou
nt of rules. Would there be any guideline/blog I could use as a reference while writing my paper?

P S: Another thing, I
'm quoting from the workshop website:

'The workshop will not have proceedings (or in other words, it will not be archiv
al), which means you can submit the same or extended work as a publication to other venues after the workshop. This mean
s we also accept submissions to other venues, as long as they are not published before the workshop date in December. '


I was not sure as to what this means. So if my paper gets accepted, does that mean I can submit the whole thing again t

I thought some of you might find the following insightful, it gives you an idea of the signal/recuitment divide in quant
 finance.

# Talking

It's hard to stay up to date with the daily deluge of quant finance research. Top institutional fi
rms **filter** before they read. With quants being paid upwards of (you know what), their time can't be wasted trawling 
twitter and linkedin. A reasonably good filtering mechanism is conferences and internal seminars.

My first experience w
ith this was in 2019 when Cubist systematic invited me to a seminar after publishing my first paper on predicting earnin
gs surprises on SSRN.

'We run a regular semi-monthly seminar series at which professors present recent research to our 
team of Portfolio Managers and analysts. The format is a 1-1.5 hour interactive session followed by dinner... we are hap
py to cover travel costs if you would like to make a special trip to NYC and we will of course accommodate your schedule
.'

It doesn't always involve external speakers, almost every firm I have worked with have some form of internal seminar
 sometimes weekly, sometimes monthly, were an employee has to discuss a new topic of interest.

However, this is not the
 only format anymore. A lot of discussions have morphed into podcasts like Jane Street’s Signals and Threads or Putnam’s
 Active Insights. Podcast recover costs more effectlydue to their marketing alure.

More recently Quant funds have becom
e the top sponsor at prestigious machine learning conferences like *NeurIPS*. The list includes firms like DE Shaw, PDT 
Partners, HRT, Two Sigma, Jane Street, and others. Once more, this is not just an opportunity for employees to obtain co
mplementary tickets to listen to state of the art research, but a great recruitment drive. It signifies “we are great, j
oin us”.

The search for alpha versus recruitment intent is getting somewhat blurred. For example, it is commonly though
t among Kaggle data science participants in challenges set up by Winton, Two Sigma, Jane Street, and G-research, that th
e firms are there to mine the collective crowd-sourced alpha. In fact no, I have been part of developing such a challeng
e, the purpose is almost purely a recruitment drive.

Some firms have taken a further step, they have concluded that in 
addition to giving money to other conferences, they might as well set up out own. There are countless examples, more rec
ently see the G-Research Distinguished Speaker Series or The Discovery: Two Sigma PhD Symposium.

If I had to rate each 
one of these on the recruitment to alpha continuum, it would probably be: (1) data science competitions, (2) podcasts, (
3) conference sponsorship and attendance, (4) conference development, and (5) then internal seminars.

# Reading

Of cou
rse, that list doesn’t stop there, the most interesting part of the continuum is from 6 onward. There is a small industr
y dedicated solely to the capture, curation, and internal dissemination of public research.

It's an open secret in the 
quantitative finance community: the volume of research and discussion generated daily is both a treasure trove and a pot
ential time sink.

When powerhouse names like Acadian Asset Management elucidate on harnessing the disposition effect fo
r a momentum strategy, or AQR delves into the intricate dance of deep learning for identifying optimal lags, it isn't ju
st their direct audience that perks up. Portfolio Managers at other funds are equally, if not more, invested in these in
sights.

So, the question stands: *How do they achieve this level of efficient information assimilation?*

Here's is how
 I approach it for ML-Quant:

&#x200B;

1. **Preemptive Filtering:** Before anything even reaches a quant's desk, it's p
assed through layers of filters. These aren't just keyword-based, but often employ sophisticated algorithms that underst
and context, ensuring only the most relevant pieces make the cut.
2. **Tooling & Infrastructure:** The digital age has b
lessed us with a suite of tools designed to curate and present information. For instance, libraries like Scrapy, BS4, an
d Selenium form the vanguard of data extraction. These are not run on traditional setups but on serverless infrastructur
es, optimizing for both speed and cost.
3. **Hidden Treasures:** Not everything requires the heavy machinery of web scra
ping. Often, a hidden API or even an RSS feed can provide a direct line to the insights. For the discerning quant, this 
is akin to stumbling upon a gold mine, ensuring real-time updates without the overhead of web crawlers.

In essence, the
 world of quantitative finance has evolved. It's no longer just about devising the most sophisticated model or algorithm
 but ensuring that the pipeline of information feeding into these models is both relevant and efficient. In a world wher
e milliseconds can mean millions, can we really afford to be anything less than optimal?

```
Google recently highlighted the importance of Machine unlearning in their [neurips challenge](https://ai.googleblog.com/
2023/06/announcing-first-machine-unlearning.html). The goal is to allow a model to forget information that is private or
 confidential, without destroying model performance on the rest of the data.

We present: [Fast Machine Unlearning Witho
ut Retraining Through Selective Synaptic Dampening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07707)

Selective synaptic dampening (SSD
) is a novel retraining-free approach to let your model forget sensitive data. It's fast, performant, and lightweight. 
 
  
SSD first selects parameters that are considerably more important for the forget set than the retain set. Next, SS
D dampens these parameters proportional to the discrepancy in their importance to the forget and retain set. We achieve 
state of the art on a number of evaluations.  
Happy to answer any questions, or discuss the problem of unlearning!

Last year I applied to 10 CS PhD programs in the US with a focus on machine learning at Stanford, Columbia, CMU, Harvard
, UMaryland, UCSD (both CS and DS PhD), Duke, UCI, UNC Chapel Hill and UIUC with zero papers but 2 years of research exp
erience. Still, I was devastated to get rejected from all of them as I did my research and applied to targeted profs onl
y whose research I was familiar with. I didn’t take GRE and as I mentioned I had zero accepted papers but 3 under submis
sion.

I was pretty low on energy for most of the first half of the year but put myself back together to apply to some m
asters program at Germany — Tubingen and Saarland and got accepted in both of them.

Current research profile:
—————————
————
And fortunately recently one of my papers got accepted at UAI 2023 and I visited the conference as well with some p
otential collaboration opportunities ahead. So after a year my profile looks like this:
 - 1 accepted paper at UAI
 - 1 
under submission at NeurIPS with scores 4,5,4,6,4 (looks like a reject)
 - 1 book chapter in Springer (to be published)

(all relevant to the area I want to do my PhD in)
 - currently doing some stuff on LLMs but doesn’t look like it will be
 in a publishable shape by the application deadlines
 - I do have 5/6 US patents filed, not sure if they are helpful as 
I heard mixed opinions 

My background:
—————————
 - Undergrad in electrical engineering from a top 5 IIT in India with 
GPA 9.15/10.

My letter writers are research scientists at industry with PhDs from US (they know me over 2 years) and on
e IIT professor (also with PhD from US, worked with him for 3 months in an internship).

Question:
—————
I am now vacill
ating between whether to go with the offer at Tubingen or Saarland, or take another shot at the US PhD programs this yea
r. If I need to point out 1 mistake that cost me heavily last year, I would say it’s that I didn’t contact potential sup
ervisors that aggressively but many of them wrote that no need to contact them beforehand! On asking why rejected despit
e being a good match, one prof replied my profile was rated highly but I had “less publications” than others and also di
dn’t submit GRE score (it was optional, I mean wtf)!

I plan to start mailing now and have some meetings next week (one 
with a prof that rejected me last year!) Probably I would take GRE too this time.

Now on the other side, I have enough 
savings to last 1-2 years in Germany, but I would be much better off with a scholarship or stipend that I won’t have in 
the beginning there. I don’t want to break all my FDs and stock market investments!

What do you think? I am scared to a
pply and get rejected all over again, and also a bit anxious to go to Germany without any scholarship or financial assis
tance.

Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I come from a robotics background (bachelor + half of my masters), however, at the end of my mas
ters, I shifted towards learning theory by taking lectures on a variety of subjects such as deep learning theory, statis
tical learning, computer vision, etc. 

&#x200B;

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in the intersection of learning theory 
and computer vision, my research work revolves around compressing neural network models, reducing their complexity and t
esting them on vision tasks (classification mostly, but sometimes extended to segmentation and object detection).

My go
-to conferences are typically CVPR, NeurIPS, ICLR...However, my supervisors and I want to try out a robotics conference,
 and my question is, which one to prefer in my case ? Knowing that I do not experiment on real robots. Is my work more s
uited for IROS or ICRA? Any other conference suggestion?

&#x200B;

Thank you for your answers.

Greetings fellow researchers,

I am 27, currently working remotely at a healthcare IT company based in Silicon Valley  (
6+ years in industrial research) where I apply deep learning methods and large language models. I recently received an e
xciting opportunity to pursue a PhD at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in a similar research area. 

While I a
m grateful for my current position and compensation, Have published in NeurIPS, EMNLP, ACL, ACM etc (NLP) with really go
od citations under company. I feel unsatisfied with the learning opportunities available in company & industry.

I am st
rongly considering pursuing the DTU PhD program full-time, but wanted to get perspectives from others before making a de
cision. How strong is DTU's AI research community?

 Given the rapid advances in large language models, is now an ideal 
time to immerse myself in academic research? There are many topics that interest me, including fairness, ethics, halluci
nations, quantization, specialized domains like healthcare/finance, and federated learning combined with LLMs.

Would ap
preciate any insights on whether moving into academia would be a wise choice at this stage versus remaining in industry.
 I welcome any suggestions or considerations I should keep in mind. 

Thank you for taking the time to share your though

Hi there, 

I am a student at Mathematical Modelling and Computation at Technical University of Denmark. I would like to
 attend the Machine Learning Summer School in 2024 ([http://mlss.cc/](http://mlss.cc/)). 

The Machine Learning Summer S
chool has as admission requirement that I provide an extended abstract on: 'A project reproducing the results of a paper
 published by someone else in a top conference or journal in ML or applied ML (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, EC
CV, AAAI, ACL, EMNLP, TPAMI, JMLR, Nature, Nature Communications, Science, Science Advances, PNAS) in the past 3 years.'


Would anyone out there like to join forces and see if we can find an interesting paper in one of the mentioned journal
s/proceedings and then reproduce their results? I am mainly interested in time series and image recognition, but I am op
en for suggestions. 

Also, if you have any ideas about good approaches to this project, I am all ears. I have found it 
a bit overwhelming to find a suitable paper.

Hope to hear from you :).
