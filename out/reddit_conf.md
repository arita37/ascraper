```
Please don't downvote. I already asked before in r/quant but you have to do that in a weekly thread and it's often hard 
to get any answers. (I've never gotten a reply to date.) There doesn't seem to be rules against this kind of post in thi
s sub though (and there are a couple of others).

This is in the US. Feel free to continue for details, or skip to **TL;
DR**.

I have a theoretical physics PhD and I did mostly heavy mathematical research with little to no programming invol
ved. I learned on my own, but due to immigration constraints, couldn't get internships because my advisor was the 'indus
try sucks' type and wouldn't approve anything that wasn't academic. So wasn't able to intern throughout PhD, and when I 
graduated in the middle of COVID, my student VISA timeline was working against me and I had to go for a post-doc. (Note:
 publication record is not super strong because it was heavy theory work, and the academic post-doc was just one year. S
o I got like 3 or 4 papers in strong journals, but not the 10+ papers in ICML, NeurIPS, etc. More of the classical 'I pu
blished good papers in good research journals', which takes time.)

I managed to then secure a fixed-term position as a 
research scientist doing ML with applications to in finance at a good tech company (like those PhD programmes at banks) 
that was basically an industry post-doc (think like Microsoft/Meta/Apple ML Post-Doc but in quant finance).

That positi
on ran out last year, and since I was still under immigration constraints, and the market being what it was, the best I 
could secure was a position as a Data Scientist at a consulting firm. I did got some buyside quant interviews, but they 
were either looking for strong quant devs or seasoned QRs and wouldn't consider me for fresh grad / early career PhD pos
itions. The sellside ones I did get seemed to expect far more tech experience despite the positions being labeled 'ML sc
ientist' or 'research scientist'.

My concern here is the branding aspect: PhD was not from a target school, not in the 
more desired majors (applied math, stats, EE), and my experience so far seems to not help either despite it fairly techn
ical ML research in quant finance.

This branding issue seems to be US-specific to me because I have a friend who went t
o London instead to do post-doc and then had no issue getting into a Tier 2 multi-strat via the typical math + LC interv
iew pipeline. His same firm would not consider me at all on the US side, even though we went to the same grad school, he
's got even less of a publication record, and we have the same competitive background (in terms of physics olympiads, GP
As, etc).

This has gotten me to the point of considering doing a short but intense specialized QF masters at a target s
chool, either in the US (Baruch MFE being my primary target) or something like the MSc in QF at Erasmus or MSc in QF at 
ETH Zurich, in Europe. (EUR examples based on duration, cost, and reputation.) Now that I finally got to a point were my
 Green Card got through, if it’s a European Masters, I'd obviously prefer to do something like that and go right back to
 the US, but I'm open to other options.

Obviously the clear flaw is that it still indicates some sort of weak profile b
ecause the obvious question would be 'why masters after PhD?' but the markets in the US vs Europe have been very differe
nt over the past 4 years (perhaps a bit more) with the typical QR hiring really favoring a more solid CS background, in 
my opinion. At some point, I'd think that's a gap you can't convincingly cover via applied research experience.

My ques
tion is: what are my options if I still want to pursue some sort of quant finance career (whether its buyside or sellsid
e)? (I'm open to all sorts of roles, including data scientist roles and the like, as long as modeling is an important co
mponent, but I'm really interested in the quant finance industry specifically.)

**TL;DR:**

Background:

* Theoretical 
Physics PhD (US, non-target)
* 1 year academic post-doc
* 2 years industry post-doc
   * Post-doc course and lack of int
ernship experience due to immigration constraints and lack of PhD advisor assistance with approvals for industry interns
hips
* Currently working as a data scientist in a consulting firm
* Very strong math background, classical ML (statistic
al learning) modeling experience
* Reasonably well-versed in Python programming (built libraries entirely from scratch a
s part of research and applied research work; worked with teams)
* Now finally have US permanent residency, and can expl
ore more options

Main problem:

* Seem to be suffering from a branding issue given career trajectory so far and lack of
 industry connections
* Not being considered for fresh PhD roles anywhere in the US (but friends with 95% similar profil
es not having this issue elsewhere in Europe)
* Not sure how to re-align and pursue a QR/QR-adjacent (read modeling-orie
nted role) career

Options considered:

* Intensive Masters in QF at Target School (US, Europe) to secure a good QR/QR-a
djacent position and spring back to the US
   * Concerned about the perception of 'Masters after PhD' (more tolerated in
 other industries, seems to be heavily frowned upon in quant finance)
* Willing to also pursue quant trading trajectory 
if it makes sense

Seeking options and guidance, flexible on roles to pursue as long as they're reasonably modeling-orie
nted as opposed to SWE-heavy (quant dev and the like)

We're excited to share that our paper on BricksRL, a library of RL algorithms that can be trained and deployed on afford
able, custom LEGO robots, has been accepted at NeurIPS 2024 as a spotlight paper!

As AI and machine learning continue t
o make waves, we believe it's essential to make reliable and affordable education tools available to the community. Not 
everyone has access to hundreds of GPUs, and understanding how ML works in practice can be challenging.

That's why we'v
e been working on BricksRL, a collaboration between Universitat Pompeu Fabra and PyTorch. Our goal is to provide a fun a
nd engaging way for people to learn about AI, ML, robotics, and PyTorch, while maintaining high standards of correctness
 and robustness.

BricksRL is based on Pybricks and can be deployed on many different LEGO hubs. We hope it will empower
 labs worldwide to prototype ideas affordably without requiring expensive robots.

My paper was ultimately rejected because the program chair introduced new weaknesses that are a

```
My goal with graduate school is to set myself up to launch a company that produces a system of swarm robots that coopera
te to efficiently assemble orbital infrastructure; I believe the space industry is in the process of taking off and such
 a system will be necessary to scale it.

  
In my undergrad, I worked on 4 major research projects.

* One on efficient
 open set multimodal 3d mapping; under review at NeurIPS MAR workshop
* One on improving the performance of reinforcemen
t learning for knowledge graph query answering; accepted to IEEE TASL journal and resulted in a patent
* One on creating
 a universal testing platform for cooperative autonomous driving; accepted to VTC 2024 conference
* One on using evoluti
onary computation to improve the performance of a neurosymbolic planning architecture with the goal of creating a natura
l language iterface for a symbolic planning system; worked on this at CMU over the summer but am still collecting result
s. Likely to submit to ICRA or IROS down the road

and one major robotics project that was just for fun; I built an auto
nomous drone that can navigate to GPS coordinates while avoiding obstacles with a depth camera. I also have a startup wh
ere we're building models to translate natural language into formatted API calls in under a second, but with all the res
earch work we've been in the beta phase for a while (though we are eyeing an aquihire from an interested local firm).

 
 
I know my future company will be a deep tech company and be heavily research-oriented in its inception, but since it i
s still a company I know I'll need more business knowhow to make it successful. I've heard that MBAs teach people how to
 be effective managers at large businesses and from my own experience I know a very different skillset is required for s
tartups, so I'm left deciding between a dual research-based MS/PhD and MBA OR pursuing a professional masters focused on
 entrepreneurship (see CMU's MSAII or MRSD programs) and getting out into the market faster. CMU, MIT, and Stanford alum
s in particular, what do you think best aligns with my goals? Thank you for any feedback you can offer!

```
Hi folks!

I am very new to quant/fintech so please forgive me for my naivety and all the mistakes I make. I was doing a
n MBBS (equivalent to a US MD) from India at one of the top med schools in the country and was so done with the people a
nd culture that I dropped out recently and started a degree in Data Science at another top university in India (although
 my program is not considered competitive at all, I couldn't go via normal route because it usually takes years of prepa
ration \~6-7 years to get into the traditional program). For now, I have \~4/4 gpa.

I have been doing a lot of neurosci
ence and have several publications concerning clinical data analyses (2), experimental neuroscience (1), one on dimensio
nality reduction algo, submitting to neurips workshops this year (3), on a topic based on physics and neuroscience prese
nting to neuroscience conference, math neuro conferences, a few other research experiences using neuroscience datasets, 
etc. This year I am also joining a lab in Germany for research. I was previously a SURF at Caltech. And the list goes on
 in the direction that to me seems very tangential to quant jobs.

For as long as I can remember I have been in love wit
h neuroscience and machine learning and now I have begun to look towards more quantitative and complex ideas above neuro
science and my first thought is either research in quantum computing (QML) or quant research jobs.

I am probably being 
super crazy thinking of even doing this, but I was wondering whether I have any chance of getting an interview at let's 
say, the Jane Street internship program, next year while I focus more on getting research in ML/math this year. Or shoul
d I do something else with my life?

Thanks for all the insight!

1. **Networking system**- **Discord, Slack, Instagram webpage** for the **clubs and classes** you are interested in. *
*Piazza** good for reference to asking questions to the instructional team+class. **Cold email and Office hours** have w
orked well in finding research jobs. **Linkedin** is great for having your online profile up top, highly recommend a pro
fessional photograph. **X/Twitter** for following your latest research if you're into EE/AI/related fields. **Geisel, Cl
asses, Intramural Sports and Greek Rush** are experiences that got me some good exposure to social aspects of campus (no
t in a frat but made friends). For jobs **Handshake and Linkedin** is enough if you have a good portfolio going on. Look
 at accepted alumnis portfolio based on your goals and see what jobs fit your traits best. **Resident life events** too 
are lit. Become a IA/SI leader. You'll have fun lol.
2. **Offerup and Facebook Marketplace** are great for furniture and
 rentals. If you're a business nerd like me, you could also practice your negotiation skills there without anything at s
take (LOL!). Other good things I found were **Styl App** and **Poshmark + thrift stores and stockx** if you're looking t
o up your fashion game.
3. **Notetaking**/**Information management-** A HIGHLY debated topic amongst students because pe
n and paper models are outdated. I used **Apple Notes** combined with P**erplexity/Claude/GPT-4** for notetaking. The wo
rkflow I follow is **lecture notes (typed or handwritten + screenshot)-> pdf textbook into perplexity/GPT and prompt to 
follow textbook-> get key concepts and insights per lesson-> work on problems and use LLMs to see how and where each min
i concept applies-> understand doubtful concepts in office hours and mail TAs/post on piazza-> reflect and add summary t
o notes-> hold group study sessions to debate tougher questions and teach what you mastered to other students.**

The wh
ole process takes about 1 hour a day to 2 max per subject- benchmark-> math 142a. Perplexity is useful for getting searc
h and images/videos directly from your notes and interacting with content on a deeper level, GPT is great for summary an
d analysis. I strongly believe we should interface LLMs with learning and conventional instruction. Never rely on LLMs f
or answers. Never cheat. libgen, **JSTOR, arXiv, nature science journal, neurIPS, internet archive** are some excellent 
sources for articles. Geisel has some articles too that can be access with campus **VPNs.** My GPA went from a 3.2 to 4.
0 with straight As thanks to this note taking system. It is like my second brain. I also met a few cool people this way,
 we learnt a lot together.

4. **Hangouts**- The most subjective thing by far. Not a local. I intern full time rn so I b
arely have time. The one activity i did choose was fitness and beaches because I can't keep up with studies otherwise. I
 go to 24 fitness or main gym. Ice rink close by or the mt soledad drive is a cool date idea for reference. Cool tidepoo
ls nearby at LJ shores you can search instagram reels idk i randomly stumbled. There's some good cafes all around town g
o on yelp. Surf spots are windansea and couple others. Convoy easily on top for asian food. Crazy bakeries and sweet sho
ps all around little italy. Hillcrest welfare wednesdays you can do cool stuff. Indian food is good mira mesa side. Mexi
can at Old town and near TJ. SDSU side has lit parties if you want go make friends there and get invited. PB amazing for
 food and party. Downtown has great museums. Seaworld and zoo, sd science center amazing. La Jolla Playhouse is cool. Ch
e cafe is awesome. Gaslamp gastropubs go hard. SD padres games great hangouts you will make lots of friends. MMA PPV eve
nts too. Weekend getaway for non locals they have a secret place at OB which I know lot of you will try goofy stuff. Rem
ember if it takes a toll on your body and affects mental health then it is not worth it.

Ah thank god for speech to tex
t. Have fun. Went through 4 years and a lot of memories.

Hey, everyone.  
Sorry for asking a noob question.  
So basically we have submitted a paper at a workshop of NeurIPS 202
4. This is our first work during our undergrad. After submission, we received an email the next day regarding a margin i
ssue that needed to be fixed, or our submission would be rejected. Which we fixed \[a very unintentional error\] and try
ing to submit it since then  but in the Openreview, it keeps saying that the invitation submission has expired. So is th
ere any deadline we have to maintain for this kind of scenario. The main review will be given in the next month. We have
 tried to contact them, but we are not getting any response.

```
Hi everyone, 

The point of this post is not to blame the authors, I'm just very surprised by the review process.

I jus
t stumbled upon this paper. While I find the ideas somewhat interesting, I found the overall results and justifications 
to be very weak.   
It was a clear reject from ICLR2022, mainly for a lack of any theoretical justifications. [https://o
penreview.net/forum?id=slHNW9yRie0](https://openreview.net/forum?id=slHNW9yRie0)  
The exact same paper is resubmitted a
t NeurIPS2023 and I kid you not, the thing is accepted for a poster. [https://openreview.net/forum?id=XH3ArccntI](https:
//openreview.net/forum?id=XH3ArccntI)

I don't really get how it could have made it through the review process of NeurIP
S. The whole thing is very preliminary and is basically just consisting of experiments.  
It even llack citations of oth
er very closely related work such as *Generative Modelling With Inverse Heat Dissipation* [https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13
397](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13397) which is basically their 'blurring diffusion' but with theoretical background and
 better results (which was accepted to ICLR2023)...

I thought NeurIPS was on the same level as ICLR, but now it seems t
o me sometimes papers just get randomly accepted.

So I was wondering, if anyone had an opinion on this, or if you have 
encountered other similar cases ?

all -  [ Derivation of the upper bound of the average regret of online-to-batch conversion in H-smoothness ](https://www.reddit.com/r/mathematics/comments/1fbn724/derivation_of_the_upper_bound_of_the_average/) , 2024-09-28-0912
```
I've been studying a \[paper\]\[1\] (Smoothness, Low-Noise and Fast Rates) on the impact of smoothness on the convergenc
e rate of online-to-batch conversion, specifically Theorem 2, which provides a bound on the average regret in the contex
t of online convex optimization. The paper claims that this theorem can be proved using Lemma 3.1 in the original paper 
and Theorem 1 from \[this thesis\]\[2\] (Online Learning: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications). However, I'm struggling
 to see the connection between these results. Could someone help clarify how Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 1 from the thesis are
 used to prove Theorem 2 in the paper?

\*\*Lemma 3.1:\*\* For an $H$-smooth non-negative function $f : W \\rightarrow \
\mathbb{R}$, for all $w \\in W$:

$$

\\|\\nabla f(w)\\|\^\* \\leq \\sqrt{4H f(w)}

$$

\*\*Theorem 1:\*\* Under the sam
e conditions as Lemma 1. Assume that a constant $L$ exists such that for all $t$, the function $f\_t$ is $L$-self-bounde
d for the norm $\\|\\cdot\\|$. Let $U\_1$ and $U\_2$ be two positive scalars and set $c = L + \\sqrt{L\^2 + \\frac{LU\_2
}{U\_1}}$. Then, for any $u \\in S$ that satisfies $f(u) \\leq U\_1$ and $\\sum\_{t=1}\^{T} g\_t(u) \\leq U\_2$, we have
,

$$

R(u, T) = \\sum\_{t=1}\^{T} g\_t(w\_t) - \\sum\_{t=1}\^{T} g\_t(u) \\leq 2\\sqrt{LU\_1U\_2} + 4LU\_1.

$$

\*\*Th
eorem 2:\*\* For any $B \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\overline{L\^\*}$, if we use stepsize

$$

\\eta = \\frac{1}{H B\^2 + \\
sqrt{H\^2 B\^4 + H B\^2 n \\overline{L\^\*}}}

$$

for the Mirror Descent algorithm, then for any instance sequence

$z\
_1, \\ldots, z\_n \\in \\mathcal{Z}$, the average regret w.r.t. any

$w\^\* \\in W$ such that $F(w\^\*) \\leq B\^2$ and 
$\\frac{1}{n} \\sum\_{j=1}\^{n} \\ell(w\^\*, z\_j) \\leq \\overline{L\^\*}$

is bounded by:

$$

\\frac{1}{n} \\sum\_{i=
1}\^{n} \\ell(w\_i, z\_i) - \\frac{1}{n} \\sum\_{i=1}\^{n} \\ell(w\^\*, z\_i) \\leq \\frac{4H B\^2}{n} + \\frac{2 \\sqrt
{H B\^2 \\overline{L\^\*}}}{n}

$$

I found the proof of Theorem 1 a bit confusing as well, particularly because it does
n't clearly explain the relationship between $U\_1, U\_2$, and $c$ in that specific manner.

# Best AI Writing Detectors in 2024

AI-generated content is everywhere, and it’s getting harder to tell if a piece of w
riting was created by an AI or a human.

I've rounded up a list of the best AI content detectors to help you figure out 
what’s human-written and what’s likely generated by AI.

# Top AI Detectors for Accuracy in 2024

* [**TraceGPT**](https
://chatgpt.com/g/g-KI6H8Bz4n-tracegpt-ai-detector): A ChatGTP bot that's described as '[basically perfect](https://zapie
r.com/blog/ai-content-detector/)' in accuracy but independent tests, using AI-generated content from various sources, in
cluding ChatGPT and Claude. Best of all, it's free!
* [**Originality.AI**](https://tinyurl.com/Originality-AI-Detect-Red
dit): Independent testers cite [98.8% accuracy](https://ddiy.co/originality-ai-review/) for detecting GPT-4 and ChatGPT 
content specifically. Unique features include fact checking in addition to AI detection
* [**Scribbr Premium AI Detector
**](https://www.scribbr.com/ai-tools/best-ai-detector/): Came out on top in independent testing with an [84% accuracy ra
te](https://www.scribbr.com/ai-tools/best-ai-detector/), the highest among the tools tested. Free and premium tools avai
lable.
* [**Winston AI**:](https://gowinston.ai/) Claims to have [99% accuracy](https://zapier.com/blog/ai-content-detec
tor/) for spotting content from ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Bard, according to their internal tests.
* [**QuillBot AI Detector**
](https://quillbot.com/ai-content-detector): Tied for second place among free tools, scoring [78% accuracy](https://www.
scribbr.com/ai-tools/best-ai-detector/) in independent testing. Features a low false positive rate. Limited free version

This semester I am in a Neural Networks class and I need to do a project. The project is a 1h presentation of a semi-rec

The thing is that this is a second course on Machine Learning from the same professor and he recommends that it has 
to be related to the presentation we did last semester. In my case it was this: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07809](https

aper is too theoretical and is difficult to do numerical experiments.

The professor agreed with me and suggested to do 
something related to **algorithmic stability** and generalization instead. So I'm asking here if any of you have a sugge

***Can we upload a revision of our paper during the rebuttal/discussion period?*** *No revisions are allowed u
ntil the camera-ready stage.*

[ICML Author instruction: ](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorInstructions)

*There 
is no option to upload a revised version of the paper during the author feedback period. Upon the acceptance of the pape
r, it is up to the authors to include any changes to improve the paper (without essentially changing its content, compar
ed to what the reviewers have seen) in the final, camera ready version of the paper.*

However, when looking into papers
 on OpenReview from previous years, in the rebuttal answers many authors say: *We updated and uploaded the revised versi
on of the paper.*.. *As per you suggestion, we made changes on page 2 in the revised version of the paper.*

So is it th
at authors just ignore the official statements from the conferences and decide to upload revisions? Also for the reviewe
rs: is it better if the author makes the changes and uploads new version of the paper during the rebuttal phase?

I'm looking to follow 
up on this. I would like to be able to drag my tasks (from a drop down view) into a slot in the calendar.

  
Maybe this
 can be done by creating a View which is List + Calendar. If this is the case, we should be able to drag tasks into the 
Calendar, and schedule it.

  
And we can have this work for mobile also. Amazing Marvin has a view like the below, wher
e you can drop down and drag a task into your week.

Hey everyone,

# Getting into a good ML Job

I want to get into a good research position to gain exposure to ML research
 from top ML research companies in the world to gain exposure and work on smaller specific niche startups to solve some 
problems. Now the problem is that I ONLY have a *CS&E degree in Computer Engineering*, in contrast to a 5-10 year experi
enced PhD principal research engineer-like position in a company that insists on getting a PhD candidate only. These com
panies often insist on hiring PhD graduates because they bring a deep level of expertise and a proven track record in re
search.

# Problems with PhD

When it comes to pursuing a PhD, I’m running into another set of challenges. Top universit
ies around the world typically admit students based on impressive resumes - which include achievements like - (1) awards
 from prestigious conferences, (2) published research papers, and (3) strong letters of recommendation from prominent pr
ofessors and there's a lot of competition too. Unfortunately, my situation is quite different.

My college school was a 
very ordinary one - I don't think we have some of the world's most prominent teachers who can write referrals or strong 
endorsements and I never had any award in my life before in an ML or Academic degree before (at least the prominent ones
) to show them. I haven’t received any major awards in Machine Learning or academia that could make my application stand
 out. This puts me at a disadvantage compared to the top candidates, who often have resumes filled with numerous accolad
es, dozens of published papers in collaboration with renowned researchers, and strong recommendations from leading figur
es in the field. Moreover, I don’t currently have a mentor or an experienced individual to guide me through the process 
of achieving these goals. This lack of mentorship adds to the pressure I’m feeling, as I’m trying to compete against som
e of the best and brightest minds who have had access to far more resources and support.  
To complicate things further,
 I live in a small town, and as the only child of retired parents, I have financial responsibilities to support them. Th
is means I can’t afford to be away for an extended period, such as the 5-6 years it typically takes to complete a PhD in
 the US or Europe. Given my family obligations, pursuing a long-term PhD abroad is not a feasible option for me.

# My c
urrent approach to solving the mess - getting a PhD

I’m in a small town, supporting retired parents, so I can’t commit 
to a long PhD abroad. So I had only two axes out of three where I seem to improve myself - *one is to write some good pa
pers into top journals (like ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, etc) and maintain a good GitHub repo as a good engineer.* 

My GitHub 
is by far average in attendance, but it is somewhat satisfactorily good enough and I trust my skills here - I can write 
implementations from papers and optimize and compile them enough for real-world deployments, and optimizers. I'm good wi
th reading papers and getting them on code quickly. Have a good idea of meta-programming and how big libraries work and 
can easily get along with the codebase or port models across platforms/frameworks.

My current plan is *to improve my pr
ofile by publishing papers in top conferences like ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS, and maintaining a strong GitHub repo*. Now t
he problem is writing papers. I'm all okay with writing a few papers as a lone author. I understand it is very difficult
 to get the first paper into conferences like ICLR, and NeurIPS in a single go, **but** **I'm open to all feedback and l
earnings all along and other adjacent papers from where I can learn things easily.**

# Need Suggestion - Are there rela
ted papers/areas/fields that'd help me?

Currently, I've compute restrictions and have been carrying out with free resou
rces. So, I've some limitations in the areas - more aligned towards theoretical problems than actual practical ones (tha
t require more compute and resources!), although I can work in any area related to language processing or computer visio
n.

I’m limited by compute resources, so I’m focusing on more theoretical areas. **So, I'm open to all the suggestions f
or the areas where I can work with less compute and isn't very hard to start.** I've found a few areas like:

1. Interpr
etability of the transformer-based language models - using probability circuits, and custom languages to interpret their
 hidden mechanism and workings. 
2. Problem-solving using instructions (Tree-of-Thoughts, Chain-of-Thoughts, etc) - thei
r theoretical analysis, study and different variations. 
3. Interpretation or eval aspects of Language models - their em
ergent abilities, locality, etc.

I’m worried about being too theoretical, as big ML orgs lean towards practical work. A
ny advice on how to proceed, or suggestions for areas that are less compute-intensive but still impactful, would be grea
tly appreciated!

# Open to other alternative suggestions too!

Thanks!
