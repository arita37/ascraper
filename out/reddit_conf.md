```
VERSES AI ($VRSSF), a cognitive computing company, is continuing to make big strides in AI. They’ve introduced a researc
h roadmap that outlines the key milestones and benchmarks. This roadmap could revolutionize the development of AI by pro
viding clear goals to measure the progress and importance of $VRSSF's research and development endeavors. 

The company 
plans to use this roadmap this year to monitor its AI progress. Basically, it wants to check whether its approach can be
 as good as or better than advanced AI models on various industry tests, all while using less data and energy.  

By mee
ting these benchmarks, VERSES can prove that they can create AI that is better, cheaper, and faster. The end goal is to 
get their AI into more hands through their Genius Platform. 

Research Roadmap Highlights: 

VERSES’ research roadmap ha
s 3 benchmarks: Classification and generation tasks, Atari 10k Challenge, and NeurIPS 2024 Melting Pot Challenge 

The f
irst benchmark, Classification and generation tasks, focuses on proving VRSSF's approach is better at tasks like recogni
zing images and creating new ones. By utilizing advanced Bayesian inference techniques, they are trying to show that the
ir method has the ability to outperform traditional deep learning methods. This test is important because it shows wheth
er VERSES can make top-quality AI while being more efficient.  

The second benchmark, the Atari 10k Challenge, is all a
bout testing VERSES' AI skills in playing video games. Unlike conventional methods that need a lot of gameplay data, VER
SES is trying to play video games almost like a human but with way less practice. $VRSSF is using active inference to he
lp their AI be super adaptable. And by doing this, they're hoping to raise the bar for how well AI can perform in gaming
 

Lastly, there’s the NeurIPS 2024 Melting Pot Challenge. This is all about testing how well VERSES' can handle tricky 
situations where lots of different AI systems need to work together. $VRSSF wants to show that their AI can understand t
hese complicated situations and work smoothly with other AI systems. Through the use of active inference and explicit re
presentational structures, VERSES aims to become a leader in creating AI systems that can collaborate effectively and ta
ckle complex problems together. 

$VRSSF publicly released this roadmap so the public can track their progress. The road
map can be accessed here: [https://www.verses.ai/rd-overview](https://www.verses.ai/rd-overview)

Hello everyone, today the ICML results are out, congratulations to all those who have papers accepted here. I'm not an a
cademic myself, but sometimes I read papers at these conferences for work, and it's really interesting. I just have a qu
estion: why do juniors have so many papers at these conferences? I thought this was something you would have to learn th
roughout your 5 years of PhD and almost only achieve in the final years of your PhD. Furthermore, I've heard that to get
 into top PhD programs in the US, you need to have some papers beforehand. So, if a junior can publish papers early like
 that, why do they have to spend 5 long years pursuing a PhD?

```
[https://www.norange.io/projects/paper\_scorer/](https://www.norange.io/projects/paper_scorer/)

A couple of years ago, 
u/programmerChilli [analyzed](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/im65ia/r_i_made_a_website_for_predicting
_whether_your/) ICLR 2019 reviews data and trained a model that rather accurately predicted acceptance results for NeurI
PS.

I've decided to continue this analysis and trained a model (total \~6000 parameters) on newer NeurIPS reviews, whic
h has twice as many reviews compared to ICLR 2019. Additionally, review scores system for NeurIPS has changed since 2019
, and here is what I've learned:

1) Both conferences consistently reject nearly all submissions scoring <5 and accept t
hose scoring >6. The most common score among accepted papers is 6. An average rating around 5.3 typically results in dec
isions that could go either way for both ICML and NeurIPS, suggesting that \~5.3 might be considered a soft threshold fo
r acceptance.

2) Confidence scores are less impactful for borderline ratings such as 4 (borderline reject), 5 (borderli
ne accept), and 6 (weak accept), but they can significantly affect the outcome for stronger reject or accept cases. 

Fo
r instance, with ratings of \[3, 5, 6\] and confidences of \[\*, 4, 4\], changing the 'Reject' confidence from 5 to 1 sh
ifts the probabilities from 26.2% - 31.3% - 52.4% - 54.5% - 60.4%, indicating that lower confidence in this case increas
es your chances.

Conversely, for ratings \[3, 5, 7\] with confidences \[4, 4, 4\], the acceptance probability is 31.3%,
 but it drops to 28.1% when the confidence changes to \[4, 4, 5\]. Although it might seem counterintuitive, a confidence
 score of 5 actually decreases your chances. One possible explanation is that many low-quality reviews rated 5 are often
 discounted by the Area Chairs (ACs).

Hope this will be useful, and thanks to u/programmerChilli for the inspiration!

```
I entered the Computer Science PhD program at our school 3 years ago (I'm in USA). I did not have a masters, they had a 
combined program thingie. I did all of the masters courses so I can master out now, but I have 0 papers. My advisorwhen 
I joined had consultancy work in France on Spring and Summer semesters, and would generally let his students fend for th
emselves and only offer feedback once you had a draft for a paper. We also had no lab or lab meetings in person, if he n
eeded to talk to you it'd be over zoom. Since I had 0 research experience I spent the last 2.5 years banging my head aga
inst the wall and making no progress.

I received an offer to join another professors lab beginning of this semester bec
ause he seemed to generally like me, with a slightly better pay as well so I accepted and changed labs. He's the head of
 the Explainable AI lab here. He expects 3 top-tier conference papers from his students (NeurIPS, CVPR, etc). The proble
m as I found out, is that there's no research direction to his lab, he has no ideas to lead you, and none of the student
s are good at collaborating, so everyone is throwing shit at a wall and hoping it sticks. XAI in general is not an excit
ing and interesting field either. Not many interesting new papers come out recently, so its mostly about coming up with 
methods no one gives a shit about, or coming up with datasets no one else has made, showing existing papers do badly, an
d training a model to say we did it better, at least from what I've observed here so far. On average his students seem t
o spend 5-6 years before finishing their PhD, and after being in this lab since January I kinda see why. Since I joined 
now, it's safe to say I have 3-5 years ahead if I stay here. I'm trying to get a paper out for NeurIPS Datasets & Benchm
ark track but part of me knows its a hack job that I assembled together just to have something to submit and appease the
 prof. Its kind of looking bleak, but I have only 8 months or so of job experience and can't seem to get any offers in t
he current market. I work full time on top of my PhD. Its been extremely stressful, and I've developed what seems to be 
treatment resistant depression over the last 3 years.

What do I do? Do I keep trying and hope it pays off? Do I just st
art writing Masters with a graduation date at the end of next semester or something so I can start applying? I can't qui
t on the spot, I kind of need the salary as I have bills to pay and no one to support me. Not a day goes by where I wish
 I could turn back time and just apply for jobs back in 2021 when I first graduated instead of this shit.

Alternatively
, there's a professor who Im relatively familiar with and have good-ish relationship with. She's primarily working in VR
&Game Dev. I mainly focused on AI because I want to get a good paying job, but have experience in both VR and game dev f
rom freelance jobs I did, and generally think its a lot more fun and tolerable than AI work for me. Would it make sense 
to try and switch labs a 3rd time? She expects journal, or maybe even just a few arxiv papers and does not seem to care 
much about conferences etc. in general, which seems doable. She doesn't pay a GRA salary though, so I'd only have a teac
hing assistant's salary if I made the switch.

I don't care about academia, I want to work in industry since my primary 
motivation is money. I've been told PhD matters when it comes to hiring but I don't know the specific papers/conferences
 etc. will matter in the end.

Hi there,

I recently finished a paper that I submitted to an EAMT workshop through OpenReviews. That workshop is going

://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#multiple-submission-policy](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#multiple-submission-policy) and
 they say this:

'ARR + Other Venue: ARR precludes multiple submissions. ARR will not consider any paper that is under r
eview in a journal or another conference at the time of submission, and submitted papers must not be submitted elsewhere
 during the ARR review period. This policy covers all journals and refereed and archival conferences and workshops witho
ut exception (e.g., TACL, Computational Linguistics, IJCAI, SIGIR, AAAI, ICASSP, ICML, NeurIPS, etc). In addition, we wi
ll not consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) publ
ished elsewhere, without exception.'

```
Maybe I'm a bit paranoid but I'm a little worried about how future employers (e.g. FAANG) might view a CS PhD in computa
tional biology (and instead I may be a 'better fit' for big pharma/biotech post-graduation).

So did come interested in 
the comp bio side of things (despite being a CS PhD major), but from a career standpoint I'm getting a little nervous fr
om a flexibility standpoint (e.g. if I want to go back into big tech). Since we publish computational approaches for bio
logy, albeit very heavily in biology/medicine-related journals (e.g. Nature Comm, Nature BioE/Genetics/Medicine/etc, Gen
ome Biology) (and much less in ML conferences like NeurIPS ICML ICLR CVPR), it 'seems' as if we are much less productive
 than other CS labs from big tech companies. (And I've heard in general CS that is not comp bio, people seem to treat co
nference and journal papers roughly equally, while in biology people treat journal papers much more heavily since they t
ake longer to publish and require more experimental rigor).

Specifically, it seems that students from other labs regula
rly publish \~3-4 conference papers a year from top ML venues, whereas we only get <1 journal publication a year (which 
is really good for non-ML fields, but somehow in ML people seem to be 'playing the publication count' game). I'm persona
lly a little worried that big tech companies like FAANG won't understand the time and rigor needed journal publications 
in comp bio (since for the time it takes to publish 1 journal paper in a biology venue (with peer review+revisions+etc),
 one could publish 2-4 ML papers if lucky).

Any thoughts (e.g. maybe I shouldn't be worried since this might not actual
ly be an issue in reality?)

```

myquals : MTech AI from IISc. My motivation for writing this post comes from an earlier post in r/GATEtard titled, ['Do
 not join MTECH AI if you have other options like CSA (currently in IISC).'](https://www.reddit.com/r/GATEtard/comments/
1bcwx0a/do_not_join_mtech_ai_if_you_have_other_options/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&u
tm_content=share_button) TLDR at the bottom.

First, I will address a few things in reply to the post:

* Three batches 
have graduated from this program, which initially started in 2019. I am from the third batch, and the previous post's OP
 is from the program's fifth batch.
* The curriculum of MTech AI was reformed recently, and now, students have more flex
ibility in taking non-AI courses. You can opt for more AI courses if you are interested in AI.
* All students from my ba
tch who applied for placements got a job (not 80%, as OP wrote in the comments). The current batch might have a lower pl
acement percentage, but the [response in this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/GATEtard/comments/1bcwx0a/comment/kvrc5n
b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) addresses the current placem
ent scenario very well. I can confirm this for my batch as well. I have batchmates (MTech AI and MTech CDS) selected by 
MasterCard, Target, Well Fargo, etc. I would love to see OP reply to this comment. :)
* In the comments, the OP mentions
 that the newer generative AI companies are demanding MLOps skills, but the IISc curriculum completely ignores them. As 
far as I remember, there were no courses on MLOps when I was a student. So anyway, MLOps skills need to be developed out
side of courses.
* Before proceeding, I suggest prospective applicants read [this LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin
.com/pulse/mtech-ai-iisc-based-my-2-years-program-saurabh-shrivastava/) as well if they need to become more familiar wit
h the course structure of MTech AI.

I joined the program in 2021 for two main reasons: I knew I wanted to pursue AI, an
d I knew I wanted to go into research and do a Ph.D. When I started the program, I had some research experience in NLP, 
and I already understood the basics of ML. However, as time passed at IISc, I understood each topic more deeply. Not onl
y this but the knowledge and comprehensibility that I gained from the math courses also made it easier for me to underst
and any new concepts and research papers very quickly. These courses also helped me with my research. So, the math you l
earned from these courses makes you a better ML researcher/engineer in the long run. Although training a model is the 'e
asiest part,' you still require knowledge of what libraries you are importing, why something is not working, what you ca
n do to make it work, etc. I do not believe I could have done the impactful research I did based only on my understandin
g from my BTech if I had not joined MTech AI.

As for the research part, I do not need to say much about IISc as a resea
rch institute. The evidence is out there. If you are interested in making impactful research contributions, IISc provide
s you with a platform to do so. Apart from getting a deeper understanding of topics, I also learned more about the resea
rch process in general. This included learning to identify and define research questions, formulate hypotheses, and desi
gn experiments or studies that would yield meaningful and impactful results. I have developed skills to lead multiple re
search projects at the same time. Furthermore, students at IISc can collaborate with leading experts in various fields, 
providing invaluable insights into different methodologies and approaches to problem-solving. IISc's resources and suppo
rtive environment enable the students to develop essential research skills such as data collection and analysis, critica
l thinking, and effective communication of complex ideas. In my own experience, delving into research at IISc has been t
ransformative. I've been a part of a constantly changing environment where people are naturally curious and where limits
 are constantly being pushed. The journey has helped me learn more about the world and given me the tools to confidently
 and wisely handle its many challenges.

Besides research, IISc also provides opportunities to pursue PhD in India and p
repares you for a PhD abroad. Most of the professors at IISc are PhDs and postdocs from prestigious universities abroad.
 They have academic collaborations all over the world. Their recommendations can get you into terrific labs abroad in yo
ur field of choice. You also have the option to extend your MTech to a Ph.D. at the end of the second year now. Nowadays
, many Ph.D. fellowships, such as Google Ph.D. fellowship, Microsoft research Ph.D. fellowship, Qualcomm innovation fell
owship, PMRF, etc, are awarded to many Ph.D. students at IISc. These fellowships provide a better stipend and more funds
 for students to travel internationally and present at various international conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, CV
PR, ECCV, EMNLP, ACL, etc, to name a few.

I never thought that I would be able to publish in NeurIPS in my lifetime, bu
t it did happen. I never thought I would get to travel and present my research to researchers from whom I have learned t
he subjects and whom I look up to. I am joining a Ph.D. program at a Top 20 university in August 2024. I was able to ach
ieve this by joining MTech AI at IISc.

In conclusion, IISc is more than just about placements. Join if you have a genui
ne interest in your field of choice. Many other blogs, Quora Answers, etc., discuss why a person should join IISc. I sug
gest prospective applicants to take a look at that as well.

To the OP of the previous post: Do not make sweeping claims
. You can write a review or personal experiences. Directly saying 'Do not do x' creates a negativity bias in the minds o
f readers.

TLDR :

I would say join IISc and specifically the MTech AI program if you fall under one of the following:


* You are already sure you want to have a career in AI moving forward.
* You want to try your hand at research.
* You w
ant to learn and understand the topics you love deeply.

all -  [ A review of MTech AI at IISc (MTech AI recent grad). ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GATEtard/comments/1c4b78u/a_review_of_mtech_ai_at_iisc_mtech_ai_recent_grad/) , 2024-05-13-0910
```
I am from the 2021-23 batch of MTech AI at IISc. My motivation for writing this post comes from an earlier post in this 
subreddit titled, 'Do not join MTECH AI if you have other options like CSA (currently in IISC).' TLDR at the bottom.

Fi
rst, I will address a few things in reply to the post:

* Three batches have graduated from this program, which initiall
y started in 2019. I am from the third batch, and the previous post's OP is from the program's fifth batch.
* The curric
ulum of MTech AI was reformed recently, and now, students have more flexibility in taking non-AI courses. You can opt fo
r more AI courses if you are interested in AI.
* All students from my batch who applied for placements got a job (not 80
%, as OP wrote in the comments). The current batch might have a lower placement percentage, but the [response in this co
mment](https://www.reddit.com/r/GATEtard/comments/1bcwx0a/comment/kvrc5nb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=we
b3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) addresses the current placement scenario very well. I can confirm this for m
y batch as well. I have batchmates (MTech AI and MTech CDS) selected by MasterCard, Target, Well Fargo, etc. I would lov
e to see OP reply to this comment. :)
* In the comments, the OP mentions that the newer generative AI companies are dema
nding MLOps skills, but the IISc curriculum completely ignores them. As far as I remember, there were no courses on MLOp
s when I was a student. So anyway, MLOps skills need to be developed outside of courses.

Before proceeding, I suggest p
rospective applicants read [this LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mtech-ai-iisc-based-my-2-years-program
-saurabh-shrivastava/) as well if they need to become more familiar with the course structure of MTech AI.

I joined the
 program in 2021 for two main reasons: I knew I wanted to pursue AI, and I knew I wanted to go into research and do a Ph
.D. When I started the program, I had some research experience in NLP, and I already understood the basics of ML. Howeve
r, as time passed at IISc, I understood each topic more deeply. Not only this but the knowledge and comprehensibility th
at I gained from the math courses also made it easier for me to understand any new concepts and research papers very qui
ckly. These courses also helped me with my research. So, the math you learned from these courses makes you a better ML r
esearcher/engineer in the long run. Although training a model is the 'easiest part,' you still require knowledge of what
 libraries you are importing, why something is not working, what you can do to make it work, etc. I do not believe I cou
ld have done the impactful research I did based only on my understanding from my BTech if I had not joined MTech AI.

As
 for the research part, I do not need to say much about IISc as a research institute. The evidence is out there. If you 
are interested in making impactful research contributions, IISc provides you with a platform to do so. Apart from gettin
g a deeper understanding of topics, I also learned more about the research process in general. This included learning to
 identify and define research questions, formulate hypotheses, and design experiments or studies that would yield meanin
gful and impactful results. I have developed skills to lead multiple research projects at the same time. Furthermore, st
udents at IISc can collaborate with leading experts in various fields, providing invaluable insights into different meth
odologies and approaches to problem-solving. IISc's resources and supportive environment enable the students to develop 
essential research skills such as data collection and analysis, critical thinking, and effective communication of comple
x ideas. In my own experience, delving into research at IISc has been transformative. I've been a part of a constantly c
hanging environment where people are naturally curious and where limits are constantly being pushed. The journey has hel
ped me learn more about the world and given me the tools to confidently and wisely handle its many challenges.

Besides 
research, IISc also provides opportunities to pursue PhD in India and prepares you for a PhD abroad. Most of the profess
ors at IISc are PhDs and postdocs from prestigious universities abroad. They have academic collaborations all over the w
orld. Their recommendations can get you into terrific labs abroad in your field of choice. You also have the option to e
xtend your MTech to a Ph.D. at the end of the second year now. Nowadays, many Ph.D. fellowships, such as Google Ph.D. fe

all -  [ [D] Multiple first-author papers in top ML conferences, but still struggling to get into a PhD progr ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1c2pnam/d_multiple_firstauthor_papers_in_top_ml/) , 2024-05-13-0910
```
**TL;DR** I come from an average family and worked hard to put myself through college, driven by my passion for research
 and innovation. Despite having multiple first-author papers in top ML conferences, contributing to open-source projects
, and making industry impact, I'm struggling to get into a PhD program. I've been rejected by top universities and feel 
lost and exhausted. I'm starting to doubt myself and wonder if a strong research background is not enough without the ri
ght connections or family background. I'm considering giving up on my dream of pursuing a PhD and doing meaningful resea
rch.

I have published many  research papers so far as the first author in top-tier conferences and workshops like EMNLP
, NeurIPS, ACM, and ACL. My research has been honored as the Best NLP Researcher by my company. I actively contribute to
 open-source projects, including PyTorch and HuggingFace, and have implemented other tools and frameworks (aggregating \
[x\]0k+ stars on GitHub). My research papers are crossing \[x\]00+ citations and an h-index of \[x\]. All have been peer
-reviewed.

I wrote these papers entirely on my own, without any supervision or guidance. From conceptualizing the initi
al idea to writing the code, conducting experiments, refining the model, and ultimately writing the paper, I handled eve
ry aspect of the research process independently. As a first-generation college graduate, there was no publication cultur
e in my company. So, I read papers, made annotated notes, and experimented with new ideas. The first paper took me a yea
r to publish because I didn't know what to write, even though the results of my idea were state-of-the-art. I went throu
gh more than 600 papers in two months to find the pattern and learn how to write papers.

**Now, here's the problem:**


I want to pursue a PhD, but for me, it's not just a way to get a degree and land a job at top companies to earn more mon
ey. I am less inclined towards financial gains. I want to pursue a PhD to have a better environment for research, build 
a strong network with whom I can brainstorm ideas, receive constructive feedback, collaborate on projects and contributi
ng something meaningful to civilization from my knowledge.

However, coming from a small city, it has been quite challen
ging. I don't know how to approach professors, and frankly, I am not very good at reaching out to people. I tried talkin
g to a few professors over email, but they didn't reply. I also applied to CMU, Stanford, and a few other universities b
ut got rejected.

I am feeling a bit exhausted. I know it's not the end of the world, but doing all this alone and tryin
g to find a good college just to do some quality research - is it really that hard?

I have seen many posts on Reddit in
 this channel where people mention that they didn't get admitted because they don't have first-author papers, or they qu
estion why universities are asking for first-author papers. I've also read that if you have a first-author paper, you're
 already set. Is that true?

If so, where am I going wrong? I have a strong research profile, and even companies like Me
ta and Google are using my research and methods, but I still can't find a good professor for my PhD. Either I am mistake
n, or those who claim that having a first-author paper will get you into a top college are wrong.

Personally, I have lo
st hope. I've started believing that you can only get into a good college if you have some academic background in your f
amily because they will guide you on where to apply and what to write. Or, if you have strong academic connections, you'
ll be accepted directly based on referrals. Unfortunately, I don't have either of these. I feel like I'm stuck in this m
atrix, and people are so complex to understand. Why can't it be straightforward? If I get rejected from all universities
, they should at least provide a reason. The only reason I received was that due to an overwhelming response, they could
n't accept me.

I'm not feeling angry, but I am confused. I have started doubting myself.  I'm wondering what I'm doing 
wrong. I feel like I should quit research.

Folks on Twitter seem not to like the idea at least the rationale. I tend to agree with them because we are pushing ever

Profile:

* Tier 1 school BA+Master's. Originally physics major turned engineering. In exams, I ranked close to the top 
of my cohort, but only in my final year. Other years more like an avg student, mostly because I couldn't do more than th
e bare minimum as I kept pinballing around doing a very broad spread of things. Due to the way courses worked, I ended u
p having to do waaaay more work than any sane person should have and basically did the BA+Master's degree in 3 years. Th
is was because I'm indecisive to a fault. My last year was basically just a CS degree: taking ML, software and hardware 
courses. The years previous were irrelevant for CS - fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, control theory, signal processing,
 linear algebra and general fundamentals in all aspects of engineering. I also spent a year doing sciences.
* I'm more c
onfident that I can get a PhD at a tier 2/3 place and currently have a 'safety offer'.
* Published workshop paper at Neu
rIPS 2023. Got a NeurIPS 2024 submission in the pipeline. I'm currently taking a (gap) year out and been chaining togeth
er research internships/programs.
* I'm interested in quite niche topics - reasoning in ML learning machines i.e. how ca
n we make them reason multi-step and more like humans, more robustly, be Turing complete, etc. Why do models fail to gen
eralise, how do causal interventions white-boxing help with this? And of course this all links to model editing, knowled
ge graphs, model unlearning/pruning and explainability. I'm also a big fan of (useful) ML theory and 'science of deep le
arning'. I suspect I would not want to work with profs who just pattern match some 20 year old technique to ML and call 
it a day, or only do Bayesian/statistical ML. I also think I want to dedicate more time to learning computational learni
ng theory, areas of pure mathematics and formal logic during my PhD.
* I don't really care for things like RL, making mo
dels 'more efficient', computer vision or ML for medicine/neuro ML.

So now the question is; I want to get into a tier 1
 PhD sometime over the next few years. Other than publishing, what else can I do to get into a tier 1 PhD? Everything se
ems in the right direction, except my major is not ideal (on paper) and despite a high final GPA, my CGPA or equivalent 
is not the best (but I have a good reason, and my school didn't have grade inflation). I can't afford a Master's because
 I would be an international student. Would cold emailing to ask to RA be a good idea?
