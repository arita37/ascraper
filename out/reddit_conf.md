**Area of Interest:** RL + NLP + Multi-agent

**Education:** BASc Chemical Engineering from UToronto, MSc Computer scien
ce from PKU, mainland China (CSRanking Asia #2 World #14). Transitioned from PhD due to unhappy experiences and career c
hoices. Undergrad cGPA 3.3/4.0, PhD cGPA 3.45/4.00

**GRE:** no plan on taking

**TOFEL**: Not required maybe given my B
ASc in Canada?

**Internship Experience**:

\- 1 year at Cenovus Energy Canada as DS intern (Co-op program during my bac
helor)

\- 1.2 year at Beijing Institute of General AI (similar but inferior to MSRA)

\- \~3 months at a Chinese LLM un
icorn startup

**Publications**:

\- 2 NeurIPS (1 co-first, 1 second), 1 ICLR (co-first), all posters no awards.

\- Thi
rd author and beyond in 2 other arXiv papers (both under review)

\- Given authorship in that startup's technical report
 of their open-sourced LLM models

\- Citation count is not good (\~20)

**LORs:**

**-** 1 from my supervisor who does 
nothing but a very nice guy (full professor)

\- 1 from my frequent collaborater who does the heavy lifting (assistant p
rofessor)

\- 1 from my technical manager at the start-up

I can't think of anyone else who could write me a very detail
ed letter, I don't know other professors really well. But these guys promised me good letters.

I am a final year PhD student in France working on privacy and  fairness topics in deep neural networks. My publication 
record is decent but not top-tier (think EMNLP, TMLR rather than ICML/NeurIPS).  Recently, I've been applying to data sc
ience and machine learning  engineering roles. However, out of 50-75 applications over the past few  weeks, I have not r
eceived any callbacks.  
I'm wondering if there is something I should optimize on resume.  Any tips would be greatly app
reciated!  


P.S. - I also posted something similar to another sub, and the key advice I received was to add publicatio
ns on the second page.

I am applying for fall 2024 for both MS and PhD in CS, with specialization in ML (NLP, Speech)

Nationality: Indian

Col
lege: top 10 in India 

CGPA: 9.8/10; CS Department rank 1

Research papers: Total 5. 2 in top speech conferences (like 
ICASSP; however speech conferencs are much less selective/reputable in comparison to say ICML, NeurIps), 1 in Comp biolo
gy journal (not sure of exact reputation but looked good to me), 2 in ML IEEE journals (international but pretty mediocr
e to the trained eye). 4 are 1st author, 1 is 3rd author.

LORs: 2 should be super strong; 1 should be strong

Work ex: 
1.5 years in ~FAANG.

Current shortlist:

PhD: MIT, UCB, UCL (London)

MS (research focused): MS CS Stanford, MLT CMU LT
I, MS CS UIUC, MS CS UT Austin, MS CS UW Madison.

Future goals: PhD if masters experience is good and I like living in 
academia in US, otherwise industry research position.

My current list is all quite ambitious and risky, but my philosop
hy is I should be happy/excited to get admission to the least favourite school in my list, otherwise no point.

Help nee
ded: Any suggestions for other excellent MS CS research focused masters (not professional masters) that I can add to abo
ve list? It's currently 8, I am planning to apply for a total of 10, so I need to decide 2 more. My current list of univ
ersities provide decent chance of landing funding in form of TA/RA, this is important to me and that's why I am avoiding
 UCSD, MS CS CMU, GATech, Columbia, NYU.

Hello. I am an international masters student in the US, applying for software engineering internships, but I haven't had

```
About to finish my PhD in a specific application of ML. The university is a pretty famous French institution, but withou
t much AI/ML prestige right now. I have a bunch of publications in industry specific conferences/journals, but no NeurIP
S/ICML/etc. After that, I'm going to work as an ML researcher for a startup which does some research and some product wo
rk.

In the long run, my ideal position would be something line a research scientist/engineer at an industry lab - I sti
ll want to do research, but definitely not in academia. DeepMind/Google, Meta, Anthropic and the likes would be perfect,
 with some preference for the first one.

What I'm looking for now is advice how to head towards that goal. As a PhD stu
dent I had - at least theoretically - a lot of flexibility in what I do, and if I got a few NeurIPS papers, I'd be golde
n. Now, I'll probably spend most of my time working on client products. This will certainly help me learn a lot and give
 many necessary skills, but that won't be as apparent on my resume.

So - how can I make sure that throughout working in
 a startup, I get stuff that will be appreciated by future, hopefully higher-profile employers, at least enough to get m
e through the resume screening stage?

Yann LeCun's stage comments were not well received, with suggestions that his next movie should focus on the dangers
 of closed-source AI [1]. LeCun also responded to a statement made by E.S. Yudkowsky regarding nuclear bombs and AI syst
ems, clarifying that AI systems do not self-replicate like nuclear bombs [16]. He further clarified that the discussion 
was about AI versus nuclear bombs, not nuclear energy, expressing his support for nuclear energy [17]. LeCun believes th
at AI is not the problem when it comes to misinformation on social networks, but rather the solution [20]. He is also an
nouncing an upcoming paper on information theory applied to Self-Supervised Learning at the NeurIPS conference [21][22].








Improving the quality of data is crucial for reliable AI, and this can be achieved using an open-source tool. Be
tter hardware and algorithms alone are not enough [2]. The author also believes that the basic AI infrastructure being o
pen source would prevent certain negative outcomes [14]. OpenAI has released a new skin for the OpenAI cookbook, an open
-source collection of examples and guides for building with the OpenAI API [8].







The cost of sequencing a human ge
nome has significantly decreased from over $300 million in 2001 to $200 today. Similar cost reduction curves can be expe
cted in the field of AI over the next 20 years [3].







Emad Mostaque, CEO of Stability AI, gave an insightful talk a
t the KPMG 2023 Tech & Innovation Symposium. He discussed the potential of Generative AI and offered an optimistic persp
ective on its dangers and risks [4]. He also discussed the potential of humans and computers working together, stating t
hat they will always surpass the capabilities of either humans or computers alone [5][6].







Hugging Face has introd
uced a new feature called Hugging Chat, which allows users to run the model directly in their browser using transformers
.js [7].







Google Research hosted a Research@ event in Mexico City featuring lightning talks and interactive demos 
on topics like Education, Science, Generative AI, and LLMs [9]. Google AI is seeking suggestions for topics to be explor
ed at future Research@ events [10].







AI has the potential to transform the way science is done by generating new r
esults and new ways to generate results. One approach is 'literature-based discovery' (LBD), which analyzes scientific l
iterature to make new discoveries. LBD systems have become more capable and are being used in fields like materials scie
nce [11]. Isomorphic Labs has been recognized as one of the most promising early-stage companies in biotech for its work
 in using AI to reimagine the drug discovery process [13].







Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of Google DeepMind and cu
rrent head of Inflection AI, believes that the future of AI lies in Interactive AI, which is artificial intelligence tha
t can react in conversation, interact with other systems, and take actions based on high-level goals [12]. Suleyman also
 envisions a future where AI assistants act as personal 'chiefs of staff' and have the ability to make decisions and ent
er into contracts on behalf of their users [19].







The author, Andrej Karpathy, discusses the limitations of machin
e learning models in understanding knowledge. He mentions that their understanding is 'patchy' and lacks intuition [15].
 The author argues that poorly designed ranking algorithms can make people addicted or depressed, even without the use o
f AI. However, AI can be beneficial in creating ranking results that are interesting, non-addictive, and non-depressing 
[18].

Hi Everyone,

I am a phd student and I am about to graduate very soon. I have a paper accepted to a machine learning con
ference (NeurIPS) this year. But I am not sure if I should attend it. The main discouraging reasons are: 1) it may take 
20 hours or more than 30 hours for me to get to the conference in new orleans (plus I still need to apply for a visa to 
US); 2) my work is done during my internship at a company but the company won't reimburse ex-interns, and by the time th
e conference starts I will be graduated from the university already. The overall trip costs over $3000 dollars. 

On the
 other hand, attending this conference may help me landing an industry job as so many companies will be there. While I h
ave other top conference papers in the past few years, I couldn't attend any conference in person due to COVID. 

Will y
ou attend the conference in this case?

This year will be my first NeurIPS, and I see some cool workshops but don't have any work that would be a good fit for t
hem. Can I just go and listen?

all -  [ TimeGAN - doubt on generated sequence ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/16oc9f2/timegan_doubt_on_generated_sequence/) , 2023-10-17-0909
```
Hello everyone

I have a doubt regarding GANs for tabular data, more specifically for time-series generation. Looking at
 the TimeGAN [paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/c9efe5f26cd17ba6216bbe2a7d26d490-Paper.p
df) ([code](https://github.com/jsyoon0823/TimeGAN)) and other implementations such as the one by [YData](https://github.
com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic/blob/dev/examples/timeseries/TimeGAN_Synthetic_stock_data.ipynb), considering that the train
ing dataset is divided into slices (like a rolling window) of N length and that the generated sequence will follow the s
ame format, that is `[batch size, N, n_features]`, what we are effectively generating are slices and not a fully synthet
ic time-series.

&#x200B;

To clarify my question, the output of a TimeGAN is only a set of slices, although there is no
 guarantee that generated slice(N-1) is the one before slice(N), and so the true use of a TimeGAN is generating slices t
hat can be used to train a predictive TS model but not reconstructing a complete time series like the one used for train
ing.

&#x200B;

I suspect that's the case (useful only to generate good slices for training predictive models) as there 
is no fully generated time series in the paper or any of the codes, while the quality of the generated data is partially
 measured by training a model on original data and generated data and comparing their predictive performance. If anyone 
can confirm/develop upon these thoughts I would be extremely grateful.

```
NeurIPS 2023 paper acceptance results are supposed to be released at 8 pm (CDT) on September 21. I thought to create a d
iscussion thread for us to countdown and discuss any celebration/issue/complaint/feedback or anything else.

There is so
 much noise in the reviews every year. Some good work that the authors are proud of might get rejected because of the no
isy system, given that NeurIPS is growing so large these years. We should keep in mind that the work is still valuable n
o matter what the final result is.

```
Hi everyone, could you kindly help to advise on my choices given the following profile? Thank you so much!

I am aiming 
for a MSCS in AI/ML field and plan to apply for both thesis based (see if I'm into research) and course based (in case I
 decide to go for industry). You may refer to my [resume](https://imgur.com/XOvOAiz) for more details. Moreover, below a
re some supplementary info:

&#x200B;

Background:

* Undergraduate from Hong Kong, on CSRankings (World: 90 - 100; Asia
: 10 - 20)
* BSc in Computer Science (CGPA: 3.52/4.3; CS major GPA: 3.56/4.3) // I got half As and half Bs
   * WES eval
uation: CGPA 3.67/4.0
* Overseas exchange at UIUC (CGPA: 3.55/4.0) // got a B- for Machine Learning course... was workin
g on NeurIPS at the time so screwed up the assignments, got As for other Non-CS courses
* English: IELTS 8.0/9.0 (expire
d May 2023; planning to take TOEFL soon)
* GRE: to be taken

Academics:

1. NeurIPS (Computer Vision related, joint 1st 
author)
2. arXiv (Computer Vision related, joint 1st author, rejected by TPAMI)
3. bioRxiv (bioinformatics related, 4th 
author, submitted to Science/AAAS journal under review)
4. Patent (reinforcement learning related, 1st author, under rev
iew)

&#x200B;

Choices:

**Dream:**  MCS@UIUC

**Ambitious:**  MSCS@USC (CS32 thesis), MSCS@NYU Courant, MSCS@TAMU, MEN
G@Waterloo ECE (co-op), MENG@Toronto ECE, MPhil@Edinburgh

**Moderate:** MSCS@Tandon, MCS@UMass, MENG@UCLA

**Safe:** MC
S@NEU SV, MENG@Waterloo ECE (non co-op)

&#x200B;

Would it be an over- or under-estimation? Please feel free to suggest
 more programs/schools.

Given that spring applications are still open, I'm also trying for the spring deadlines in Sep/
Oct, if it has less severe competition. Since I primarily wish for research based, so having less internships does not a
ffect much.

&#x200B;

Update 20230919

Last year I was rejected by MSSE@CMU-SV, MCS@UIUC, MSCS@Columbia, MSCS@SFU, MSCS
@UBC

If possible, can you also comment on my possibility of going for research-based alternatives of the MCS programs a
bove? E.g. MS/PhD@UMass, MMath@Waterloo, MSCS@UCLA

all -  [ Is it weird to send out cold emails asking professors for an opportunity to do a long-term self-fund ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/16l25ha/is_it_weird_to_send_out_cold_emails_asking/) , 2023-10-17-0909
```
As the title suggests, I'm currently pursuing a CS PhD in China. However, I'm considering a different career path and ha
ve decided to mastering out to pursue a PhD in the US. I'm aiming for a top 10-20 school in the field of computer scienc
e, but I'm not sure if my profile is competitive enough. I have 2-3 papers published in venues like NeurIPS and ICLR, as
 well as work experience. However, I feel I lack strong references, particularly from the US. I've heard that recommenda
tion letters are as important as qualifications.

Therefore, I'm considering delaying my grad application for at least s
ix months. During this time, I plan to visit a renowned lab to gain more experience and connect with professors who coul
d write me recommendation letters. I've sent out 3-4 cold emails to professors who I believe would be a good fit. In the
se emails, I expressed my interest in working with them and briefly outlined my research plans. I also mentioned that I 
could self-fund my visit if necessary. The emails are quite long, usually 200-300 words. As for now I have yet received 
any response from them.

Do you think it's off-putting to directly ask about the possibility of a self-funded visit with
out prior conversations? Which might appear that I am quite desperate.
