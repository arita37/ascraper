AI company Anthropic is set to participate in the AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, with CEO
 Dario Amodei joining AWS CEO Andy Jassy for the keynote. The event will be livestreamed and will cover topics such as c
loud transformation, data innovations, AI/ML, and AWS news[1].







GPT-4, an AI model, has demonstrated impressive pe
rformance in radiology tasks, including disease classification and report summarization. The model has potential to stru
cture radiology reports automatically, improving standardization and consistency in disease descriptions. It can also tr
anslate medical reports into more empathetic and understandable formats for patients and healthcare professionals[2].








OpenAI is focusing on safety in AI development, with ongoing efforts in preparedness, reliable AI deployment resear
ch, and AI security research. They are inviting discussions on these topics at NeurIPS[3].







Pika 1.0, an idea-to-v
ideo platform, is now available to new users on the web and Discord. The platform allows users to create and edit videos
 using AI[5][12][16][44]. Pika Labs, the company behind Pika 1.0, has raised $55 million in funding and is hiring for va
rious roles[7][8][9][29]. The company aims to make video creation accessible to everyone and is looking for passionate a
nd ambitious team members[8].







A new AI system, Sturgeon, has been developed for brain tumor surgeries. It uses ra
pid nanopore sequencing to obtain molecular subclassification of tumors in under 90 minutes. The system can assist in ne
urosurgical decision-making and potentially prevent additional surgeries[42][43].







Artie has launched its Analytic
s Portal, a real-time database replication solution that provides visibility into streaming data pipelines and offers sy
stem infrastructure monitoring[45]. Decoherence has launched Stable Video, a next-generation video generator that allows
 users to create videos with remarkable camera movement and fidelity using just a starting image or text[46]. Solve Inte
lligence, a legal tech startup, has raised $3 million in funding. The company provides an AI-powered in-browser document
 editor for patent attorneys to write high-quality patents efficiently[47].







NVIDIA has announced NeMo Retriever, 
a microservice that allows for the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities into AI applications
. RAG combines information retrieval with large language models (LLMs) to enhance their knowledge and address limitation
s[50][53]. NVIDIA's AI technology, Picasso, has been recognized as one of the Next Big Things in Tech in AI and data by 
Fast Company[49][52].







Google Research has made contributions to Call Screen on Pixel phones, a feature that uses 
on-device ASR to transcribe callers' requests in real-time[55]. The Google Research team in Ghana has been collecting da
ta to train automatic speech recognition models for local languages in Africa[57].







SDXL Turbo is a real-time text
-to-image generation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance by using a new distillation technology. This techn
ology allows for single-step image generation with high quality[58]. Yann LeCun and Catherine Rathkopf wrote an essay di
scussing the misconception that language models like ChatGPT are intelligent simply because they are fluent[61].








Cohere is hosting a demo showcase with Stepan Pushkarev, CEO and CTO of Provectus Inc, at their booth 124 every day at 1
0:30 am and 1:30 pm PT during the AWS re:Invent event[62].

OpenAI's approach to Q-Learning has been drawing significant attention recently.

However, there's a fundamental issue i
n the way Q-learning is typically implemented in deep learning and neural network environments. This concern is highligh
ted in the award-winning paper 'Non-delusional Q-learning,' presented at NeurIPS.

The paper suggests a fundamental flaw
 in the blind application of Q-learning updates to deep neural networks. It points out that such updates can create a se
lf-contradictory scenario where improving the network for the current batch of data inadvertently makes it less effectiv
e for other batches. This is akin to a situation in supervised learning where optimizing a network for a specific set of
 data may degrade its performance on other datasets.

ively, AGI has been defined as an autonomous system that surpasses human capabilities in the majority of economically va
luable tasks.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:1-4) Creating AGI is a pri
mary goal of some [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) research and of compa

The timeline for AGI development remains a subject of ongoing d

ke a century or longer; and a minority believe it may never be achieved.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial

complete forms of AGI[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:11-6) or if new ap

Contention 
exists over the potential for AGI to pose a threat to humanity;[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_

 present a risk.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-8)[\[5\]](https://en.wik

\------------------------------ end update

My issue with this is why is one organization 
defining what AI is? And so drastically at that. Why isn't there a community of AI scientist and engineer's that are agr
eeing on such a pivotal definition for an agreed upon general consensus?

**Original Post:**

Upon researching why peopl
e are so confused by what is meant by the today's (apparently) lightning rod term 'Artificial General Intelligence' or '
AGI' one would have to look to none other than how OpenAI moved the goal post of what AGI is. Wikipedia: [https://en.wik
ipedia.org/wiki/Artificial\_general\_intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)

\>  A

s an autonomous system that surpasses human capabilities in the majority of economically valuable tasks.[\[4\]](https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:1-4) Creating AGI is a primary goal of some [artificial
 intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) research and of companies such as [OpenAI](https:/

epMind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind), and [Anthropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic). AGI is a comm
on topic in [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) and [futures studies](https://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Futures_studies).

Odd, who is notation 4? Hmm, who could that be that wrote an update to what the definition o
f what AGI means. Oh it's OpenAI themselves.

4. ['OpenAI Charter'](https://openai.com/charter). *openai.com*. Retrieved
 6 April 2023.

I'm not going to go into a diatribe about how the definition is purely related to Effective Altruism and
 not rooted in technical reality. But I will show you that just a few paragraphs down in the same article they describe 
AGI in a much different way.

\>  Terminology

AGI is also known as strong AI,[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art
ificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKurzweil2005260-10)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_gene
ral_intelligence#cite_note-Kurzweil_2005-08-05-11) full AI,[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_int
elligence#cite_note-12) human-level AI[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:2
-5) or general intelligent action.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTN
OTENewellSimon1976-13) However, some academic sources reserve the term 'strong AI' for computer programs that experience
 [sentience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience) or [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness).[\
[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-Searle's_Strong_AI-14) In contrast, weak A
I (or narrow AI) is able to solve one specific problem, but lacks general cognitive abilities.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipe
dia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-15)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_inte
lligence#cite_note-Kurzweil_2005-08-05-11) Some academic sources use 'weak AI' to refer more broadly to any programs tha
t neither experience consciousness nor have a mind in the same sense as humans.[\[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art
ificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-Searle's_Strong_AI-14)

Related concepts include artificial [superintelligence](h
ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence) and transformative AI. An artificial superintelligence (ASI) is a hypoth
etical type of AGI that is much more generally intelligent than humans.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial
_general_intelligence#cite_note-16) And the notion of transformative AI relates to AI having a large impact on society, 
for example similar to the agricultural revolution.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligenc
e#cite_note-17)

It seems as if they wanted to water down and dilute the understanding and meaning of what AGI is for pe
rhaps I don't know contractual obligations?

[https://openai.com/our-structure](https://openai.com/our-structure)

* Fou
rth, profit allocated to investors and employees, including Microsoft, is capped. All residual value created above and b
eyond the cap will be returned to the Nonprofit for the benefit of humanity.
* Fifth, the board determines when we've at
tained AGI. Again, by AGI we mean a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.
 Such a system is excluded from IP licenses and other commercial terms with Microsoft, which only apply to pre-AGI techn
ology.

Interestingly this was reported in many places as much as 6 days ago.

[https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/25bb2-op

Point is. How do yo
u get to change the goal post and determine all by yourselves what AGI is? Nah this isn't going to fly. Nice try. I feel
 this verbiage is going to get changed very soon.

teams behind the various projects. I must agree that these two are the most critical issues about DreamLab and the burde
n of solving them shouldn't be given to the users. However I decided to write this post to give a better insight to what
 DreamLab has achieved so far. While the results are far from being as much as those of F@H and BOINC, I think that ther

 version and hasn't been peer-reviewed or published on a scientific journal. I have no information on why there is only 
a pre-print, and the last news published on the Institute's website about DreamLab is [this one](https://www.garvan.org.

# AIRC

I couldn't find any paper relate
d to DreamLab, however Cell Identity Hunter phase 2 is still going. The team behind the projects is still active, and th
e last news (at least on the italian version of the app) is from 25 May 2023. AIRC is one of the biggest for cancer reas
erch in Italy, so I expect for something to be published in the future (possibly after 2024). I'll keep you updated.

Please notice that my research was definetely more focused on the DRUGS/CORONA-AI projects, so the results are d
efinetely biased. The fact that I couldn't find anything for the other projects doesn't necessarily mean that nothing ha
s been published yet, so don't be frustrated about it.

I'm currently in the process of building a feature selection framework for reinforcement learning.

s://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1273496.1273589)

B. Context :

\--> I am experimenting with the non-continuous lunar lander 
environment using gym library. And I want to add two additional features that are introduced as random noise, incrementi
ng the observation space  to (8 + 2 ) = 10. I will then train my lunar lander using PPO algorithm, and use my feature se
lection framework to rank them and select the original 8 features, i.e excluding noise. (2 features.)

C. What do I need
 help with ?

\--> How should I be adding the noise ? Meaning what type of noise should be ideal for this ? I'm new to  
RL, and hence still learning.

D. What I have seen so far  on my own:

\--> After scouring some google searches on ' how
 to introduce noise in RL' lead me to other reddit posts, medium articles. I found that these lead me to the following t
opics :

1. Out-of-Distribution Detection in RL, Ex paper : [https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14990](https://arxiv.org/abs/200
4.14990), [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.02694.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.02694.pdf), [https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.4898
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.4898),

//arxiv.org/pdf/1706.10295.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.10295.pdf).

Some additional questions :

1. While searching 
for  'How to add NOISE in RL' opened me up to a whole new world of types of NOISE. My goal is to : a. add noise in my ob
servation space, b. possibly add a type of noise replicating real-world noise. (Most common ones I see are talking about
 Gaussian noise).
2. My feature selection framework accounts for implicit-state-reward dependency, similar to section A 
paper 1 linked above. The GOAL of my research is build algorithms to improve ROBUSTNESS, AND SAFETY for applicatIons usi
ng RL. Hence, building a custom feature selection framework is one of the first step towards it. PLEASE feel free to lin
k other open challenges in real-world RL applications, so I have the opportunity to address and work on them in my futur
e works.

Hey guys,

Im looking for a profile evaluation, and suggestions. I applied to PhD programs last cycle and was accepted t
o 2, which I turned down. Im applying this cycle again. My profile is pretty similar and so are my recommendations, so I
m not sure if I should have high hopes. Currently 3.8 GPA MS in CS student at a top 30 US University (by CS rankings for
 AI). 2 publications in robotics (IROS), 1 in NeurIPS this year (but I'm the 4th author), and 1 first author work under 
review at ICLR, one under review at  AAAI. 2 pretty strong recommendations, one from a faculty whose course I took and T
A'd for.

Im planning on applying to:
MILA, UNC Chapel Hill, CMU, NYU, USC, SFU, UCR, Virgina Tech, University of Washin
gton. 

One drawback of my profile is that I was enrolled as a PhD at my current uni, and didn't like the topic and didn
t find a good fit. So I've decided to apply elsewhere (finishing up as a MS at my current uni), but I think this negativ
ely impacts my applications because I thought I had a good profile but didn't get any interviews last year. Let me know 
what you think

```
I recently began my career as a Machine Learning Engineer, marking my first job in the industry. A few months ago, I com
pleted an MPhil program specializing in Environmental Engineering, with a research focus on applying ML in that field. T
hroughout my job search, I frequently encounter questions about my academic background. Additionally, utilizing ML techn
ologies has become increasingly convenient with the availability of user-friendly APIs.

&#x200B;

To enhance my competi
tiveness in the industry, I am looking to take proactive steps. I have been actively staying updated on ML technologies 
and trends, and now I am considering the following options:

1. As an independent researcher, try to publish papers in t
op conferences in the field like CVPR and NeurIPS.

2. Expand my knowledge in data engineering and MLops and work on end
-to-end personal projects.

&#x200B;

I understand that both of these options require a significant investment of time a
nd energy. Therefore, I wonder which option would be more worthwhile in terms of my time and effort. It is important to 
note that I am interested in working in the industry and do not intend to pursue a career in academia.

```
If anyone is interested in learning AI/LLM's and you’re more familiar with dotnet than python, take a look at my [NanoGp
tDotnet](https://github.com/biegehydra/NanoGptDotnet) project. It is a direct translation of a [project](https://github.
com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture) by Andrej Karpathy, a leading expert in deep learning and LLM's. His project was written 
while recording the youtube video: [Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?
v=kCc8FmEb1nY) The design used in the better model, NanoGpt in my project, is based off the breakthrough [Attention Is A
ll You Need](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf) arti
cle.

The project is meant to be a learning aid for you to learn about LLM's. I added a lot of the comments from Andrej 
Karpathy, some of my own comments, some from GPT-4, and timestamps to relevant sections of the youtube video. The projec
t uses TorchSharp (from the dotnet team) which uses the same naming conventions as python so the knowledge you gain from
 my project is very translatable to python. I also tried to never use the var keyword so you can have a better idea of w
hat's going on.

The NanoGpt project is only 600 lines of code, most of which are whitespace and comments, so don't hesi
tate to give it a look and let me know what you think!

all -  [ [D] Machine Learning PhD failure? Navigating the harsh reality of graduating without publications ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/17skp7j/d_machine_learning_phd_failure_navigating_the/) , 2023-12-08-0910
```
Hi ML community, 

I'm nearing the end of my three-year PhD journey. Throughout this period, I've dedicated myself to pr
oducing a research paper annually, targeting top-tier conferences like ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS. Despite my efforts and r
esubmissions, none of my papers made it through. As a result, my publication record consists solely of three manuscripts
 on arXiv.

My initial post-PhD ambition was to delve deeper into machine learning research at leading tech companies su
ch as Facebook, Google, or Microsoft. However, my applications were turned down, primarily due to the lack of publicatio
ns in prestigious conferences, which seems to be a crucial criterion for these roles.

Confronted with this setback and 
the pressing need to manage my finances, I shifted my focus to more traditional industry roles in consulting and finance
. I've recently secured a position in quant finance, which, while exciting, means I won't have the bandwidth to revisit 
and resubmit my research papers.

Reflecting on this journey, I sometimes feel disheartened, questioning the value of my
 PhD experience, especially when I consider my lack of published work in major machine learning conferences.

I see othe
r PhD students in my field publish 2 papers per year in these top conferences which makes me wonder whether I am a failu
re? I'm open to any thoughts or advice on my situation.

```
I've had the Neurio Home Energy Monitor (USA, Split Phase) for many, many years. Since they first came to the market, I 
was an early adapter. 
And it's been **rock solid**.

I just ordered another one for my cabin. (New in box from eBay, ab
out $60 after shipping (I set up scheduled alert, and low-balled a best offer)
I had it up and running in minutes. (Conn
ected to WiFi, registered to my existing cloud account, API enabled, and integrated in Home Assistant). 

Despite being 
vaporware and sold off to Generac and later abandoned, the API lives on,and the Home Assistant integration keeps working
. 
AND EVEN IF THEY DO KILL THE API (Aka, 'The MyQ treatment'), THERE IS STILL LOCAL ACCESS. (Which I don't use, YET)

*
*Existing Home Assistant integration:**  
https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/neurio_energy  
Two sensors will be
 created with the following names:   
* Energy Usage: Current active power usage in Watts. Updated every 10 seconds.   

* Daily Energy Usage: Daily power usage in kWh. Updated every 2.5 minutes.   

Polls via the cloud API (Which is still a
ctive!)  
https://api-docs.neur.io/#overview   

   
**Local Sensor Access:**  
JSON via IP:  
Example:   
http://192.16
8.1.xxxx/current-sample   
https://api-docs.neur.io/#sensor-local-access   
And in case the cloud doc ever goes missing,
 I've cloned it here: https://pastebin.com/raw/7YUCSzCe
   

Food for thought for those looking for an energy monitoring
 solution, but don't want to shell out a lot of money. 
I was about to pull the trigger on the 'DIY-ish' methods, but af
ter getting the board, CT sensors, etc, it will still going to cost at least $100. On top of that, forums are full of pe
ople struggling to set them up, calibrate them properly, etc.  I wasn't up for the task. I wanted a turn-key solution re
ady out of the box.

Hi folks! I'm an undergraduate senior studying CS and Statistics at a T10 undergrad school (not for CS PhD, though); I'm
 also concurrently getting my M.S. in CS here as well. I have research experience in industry (at a top AI Research lab 
for 2 summers and ongoing part-time during the year for follow-up work / paper writing) and in academia (undergraduate h
onors thesis, and several collaborations with researchers both at my university and elsewhere). I have a few publication
s -- 2 at workshops (NeurIPS) and 4 pre-prints for papers under review at tier 1 venues (all first-author or co-first au
thor). I will add that my research experience appears to be a little unorthodox at the undergrad level, as most of my pr
ojects in academia have been self-initiated and self-devised, turning to mentor(s) (profs and sometimes PhD students) fo
r feedback, rather than working in a lab consistently with PhD students, postdocs, and a professor.

I also have quite a
 bit of teaching experience (TA'd 6 courses, all upper-level, majority being graduate-level) and some professional servi
ce (served as a reviewer for a few tier-1 conference workshops; some departmental service and other leadership stuff too
). LoRs most likely coming from an industry mentor, a research (thesis) advisor, and another professor I was Head TA for
 (am curious if there are any opinions on whether I should be going in a different direction for the 3rd recommender).


The reason I'm posting here is: I'm nervous that my GPA is a bit lower than the top programs' averages, and I'm wonderin
g if that'll be strongly held against me / a dealbreaker. Part of the reason for this is mental health struggles while b
eing overwhelmed with commitments. I'd say my course rigor is generally pretty strong (given that a lot of the technical
 courses are graduate / doctoral-level) despite that, but I'm worried that the GPA may be an immediate turnoff for those
 reviewing my application. As you probably can expect, I'm interested in Stanford, MIT, Princeton, CMU, etc.

Thanks in 
advance for your feedback and insights (and for taking the time to read all of this :))!!
