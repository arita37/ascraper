myquals : MTech AI from IISc. My motivation for writing this post comes from an earlier post in r/GATEtard titled, ['Do
 not join MTECH AI if you have other options like CSA (currently in IISC).'](https://www.reddit.com/r/GATEtard/comments/
1bcwx0a/do_not_join_mtech_ai_if_you_have_other_options/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&u
tm_content=share_button) TLDR at the bottom.

First, I will address a few things in reply to the post:

* Three batches 
have graduated from this program, which initially started in 2019. I am from the third batch, and the previous post's OP
 is from the program's fifth batch.
* The curriculum of MTech AI was reformed recently, and now, students have more flex
ibility in taking non-AI courses. You can opt for more AI courses if you are interested in AI.
* All students from my ba
tch who applied for placements got a job (not 80%, as OP wrote in the comments). The current batch might have a lower pl
acement percentage, but the [response in this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/GATEtard/comments/1bcwx0a/comment/kvrc5n
b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) addresses the current placem
ent scenario very well. I can confirm this for my batch as well. I have batchmates (MTech AI and MTech CDS) selected by 
MasterCard, Target, Well Fargo, etc. I would love to see OP reply to this comment. :)
* In the comments, the OP mentions
 that the newer generative AI companies are demanding MLOps skills, but the IISc curriculum completely ignores them. As 
far as I remember, there were no courses on MLOps when I was a student. So anyway, MLOps skills need to be developed out
side of courses.
* Before proceeding, I suggest prospective applicants read [this LinkedIn article](https://www.linkedin
.com/pulse/mtech-ai-iisc-based-my-2-years-program-saurabh-shrivastava/) as well if they need to become more familiar wit
h the course structure of MTech AI.

I joined the program in 2021 for two main reasons: I knew I wanted to pursue AI, an
d I knew I wanted to go into research and do a Ph.D. When I started the program, I had some research experience in NLP, 
and I already understood the basics of ML. However, as time passed at IISc, I understood each topic more deeply. Not onl
y this but the knowledge and comprehensibility that I gained from the math courses also made it easier for me to underst
and any new concepts and research papers very quickly. These courses also helped me with my research. So, the math you l
earned from these courses makes you a better ML researcher/engineer in the long run. Although training a model is the 'e
asiest part,' you still require knowledge of what libraries you are importing, why something is not working, what you ca
n do to make it work, etc. I do not believe I could have done the impactful research I did based only on my understandin
g from my BTech if I had not joined MTech AI.

As for the research part, I do not need to say much about IISc as a resea
rch institute. The evidence is out there. If you are interested in making impactful research contributions, IISc provide
s you with a platform to do so. Apart from getting a deeper understanding of topics, I also learned more about the resea
rch process in general. This included learning to identify and define research questions, formulate hypotheses, and desi
gn experiments or studies that would yield meaningful and impactful results. I have developed skills to lead multiple re
search projects at the same time. Furthermore, students at IISc can collaborate with leading experts in various fields, 
providing invaluable insights into different methodologies and approaches to problem-solving. IISc's resources and suppo
rtive environment enable the students to develop essential research skills such as data collection and analysis, critica
l thinking, and effective communication of complex ideas. In my own experience, delving into research at IISc has been t
ransformative. I've been a part of a constantly changing environment where people are naturally curious and where limits
 are constantly being pushed. The journey has helped me learn more about the world and given me the tools to confidently
 and wisely handle its many challenges.

Besides research, IISc also provides opportunities to pursue PhD in India and p
repares you for a PhD abroad. Most of the professors at IISc are PhDs and postdocs from prestigious universities abroad.
 They have academic collaborations all over the world. Their recommendations can get you into terrific labs abroad in yo
ur field of choice. You also have the option to extend your MTech to a Ph.D. at the end of the second year now. Nowadays
, many Ph.D. fellowships, such as Google Ph.D. fellowship, Microsoft research Ph.D. fellowship, Qualcomm innovation fell
owship, PMRF, etc, are awarded to many Ph.D. students at IISc. These fellowships provide a better stipend and more funds
 for students to travel internationally and present at various international conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, CV
PR, ECCV, EMNLP, ACL, etc, to name a few.

I never thought that I would be able to publish in NeurIPS in my lifetime, bu
t it did happen. I never thought I would get to travel and present my research to researchers from whom I have learned t
he subjects and whom I look up to. I am joining a Ph.D. program at a Top 20 university in August 2024. I was able to ach
ieve this by joining MTech AI at IISc.

In conclusion, IISc is more than just about placements. Join if you have a genui
ne interest in your field of choice. Many other blogs, Quora Answers, etc., discuss why a person should join IISc. I sug
gest prospective applicants to take a look at that as well.

To the OP of the previous post: Do not make sweeping claims
. You can write a review or personal experiences. Directly saying 'Do not do x' creates a negativity bias in the minds o
f readers.

TLDR :

I would say join IISc and specifically the MTech AI program if you fall under one of the following:


* You are already sure you want to have a career in AI moving forward.
* You want to try your hand at research.
* You w
ant to learn and understand the topics you love deeply.

all -  [ [D] Multiple first-author papers in top ML conferences, but still struggling to get into a PhD progr ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1c2pnam/d_multiple_firstauthor_papers_in_top_ml/) , 2024-04-16-0910
```
**TL;DR** I come from an average family and worked hard to put myself through college, driven by my passion for research
 and innovation. Despite having multiple first-author papers in top ML conferences, contributing to open-source projects
, and making industry impact, I'm struggling to get into a PhD program. I've been rejected by top universities and feel 
lost and exhausted. I'm starting to doubt myself and wonder if a strong research background is not enough without the ri
ght connections or family background. I'm considering giving up on my dream of pursuing a PhD and doing meaningful resea
rch.

I have published many  research papers so far as the first author in top-tier conferences and workshops like EMNLP
, NeurIPS, ACM, and ACL. My research has been honored as the Best NLP Researcher by my company. I actively contribute to
 open-source projects, including PyTorch and HuggingFace, and have implemented other tools and frameworks (aggregating \
[x\]0k+ stars on GitHub). My research papers are crossing \[x\]00+ citations and an h-index of \[x\]. All have been peer
-reviewed.

I wrote these papers entirely on my own, without any supervision or guidance. From conceptualizing the initi
al idea to writing the code, conducting experiments, refining the model, and ultimately writing the paper, I handled eve
ry aspect of the research process independently. As a first-generation college graduate, there was no publication cultur
e in my company. So, I read papers, made annotated notes, and experimented with new ideas. The first paper took me a yea
r to publish because I didn't know what to write, even though the results of my idea were state-of-the-art. I went throu
gh more than 600 papers in two months to find the pattern and learn how to write papers.

**Now, here's the problem:**


I want to pursue a PhD, but for me, it's not just a way to get a degree and land a job at top companies to earn more mon
ey. I am less inclined towards financial gains. I want to pursue a PhD to have a better environment for research, build 
a strong network with whom I can brainstorm ideas, receive constructive feedback, collaborate on projects and contributi
ng something meaningful to civilization from my knowledge.

However, coming from a small city, it has been quite challen
ging. I don't know how to approach professors, and frankly, I am not very good at reaching out to people. I tried talkin
g to a few professors over email, but they didn't reply. I also applied to CMU, Stanford, and a few other universities b
ut got rejected.

I am feeling a bit exhausted. I know it's not the end of the world, but doing all this alone and tryin
g to find a good college just to do some quality research - is it really that hard?

I have seen many posts on Reddit in
 this channel where people mention that they didn't get admitted because they don't have first-author papers, or they qu
estion why universities are asking for first-author papers. I've also read that if you have a first-author paper, you're
 already set. Is that true?

If so, where am I going wrong? I have a strong research profile, and even companies like Me
ta and Google are using my research and methods, but I still can't find a good professor for my PhD. Either I am mistake
n, or those who claim that having a first-author paper will get you into a top college are wrong.

Personally, I have lo
st hope. I've started believing that you can only get into a good college if you have some academic background in your f
amily because they will guide you on where to apply and what to write. Or, if you have strong academic connections, you'
ll be accepted directly based on referrals. Unfortunately, I don't have either of these. I feel like I'm stuck in this m
atrix, and people are so complex to understand. Why can't it be straightforward? If I get rejected from all universities
, they should at least provide a reason. The only reason I received was that due to an overwhelming response, they could
n't accept me.

I'm not feeling angry, but I am confused. I have started doubting myself.  I'm wondering what I'm doing 
wrong. I feel like I should quit research.

Profile:

* Tier 1 school BA+Master's. Originally physics major turned engineering. In exams, I ranked close to the top 
of my cohort, but only in my final year. Other years more like an avg student, mostly because I couldn't do more than th
e bare minimum as I kept pinballing around doing a very broad spread of things. Due to the way courses worked, I ended u
p having to do waaaay more work than any sane person should have and basically did the BA+Master's degree in 3 years. Th
is was because I'm indecisive to a fault. My last year was basically just a CS degree: taking ML, software and hardware 
courses. The years previous were irrelevant for CS - fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, control theory, signal processing,
 linear algebra and general fundamentals in all aspects of engineering. I also spent a year doing sciences.
* I'm more c
onfident that I can get a PhD at a tier 2/3 place and currently have a 'safety offer'.
* Published workshop paper at Neu
rIPS 2023. Got a NeurIPS 2024 submission in the pipeline. I'm currently taking a (gap) year out and been chaining togeth
er research internships/programs.
* I'm interested in quite niche topics - reasoning in ML learning machines i.e. how ca
n we make them reason multi-step and more like humans, more robustly, be Turing complete, etc. Why do models fail to gen
eralise, how do causal interventions white-boxing help with this? And of course this all links to model editing, knowled
ge graphs, model unlearning/pruning and explainability. I'm also a big fan of (useful) ML theory and 'science of deep le
arning'. I suspect I would not want to work with profs who just pattern match some 20 year old technique to ML and call 
it a day, or only do Bayesian/statistical ML. I also think I want to dedicate more time to learning computational learni
ng theory, areas of pure mathematics and formal logic during my PhD.
* I don't really care for things like RL, making mo
dels 'more efficient', computer vision or ML for medicine/neuro ML.

So now the question is; I want to get into a tier 1
 PhD sometime over the next few years. Other than publishing, what else can I do to get into a tier 1 PhD? Everything se
ems in the right direction, except my major is not ideal (on paper) and despite a high final GPA, my CGPA or equivalent 
is not the best (but I have a good reason, and my school didn't have grade inflation). I can't afford a Master's because
 I would be an international student. Would cold emailing to ask to RA be a good idea?

FAR AI is seeking applications for a skilled Technical Lead to spearhead the delivery of our technical AI safety researc
h and red-teaming projects.

**About Us**

FAR AI is a technical AI research non-profit, focused on ensuring the safe de
velopment and deployment of frontier AI technologies.

Since starting in July 2022, FAR has grown to 12 FTE, produced 13
 academic papers, hosted events for some of the world’s leading AI & computer science researchers, and opened our AI saf
ety focused co-working space which is home to around 40 members.

**About FAR Research**

Our research team likes to mov
e fast. We explore promising research directions in AI safety and scale up only those showing a high potential for impac
t. Unlike other AI safety labs that take a bet on a single research direction, FAR aims to pursue a diverse portfolio of
 projects. We also put our research into practice through red-teaming engagements with frontier AI developers.

Our curr
ent focus areas are building a *science of robustness* (e.g. finding vulnerabilities in superhuman Go AIs), finding more
 effective approaches to *value alignment* (e.g. training from language feedback), and *model evaluation* (e.g. inverse 
scaling and codebook features).

**Other FAR Projects**

To build a flourishing field of AI safety research, we host tar
geted workshops and events, and operate a co-working space in Berkeley, called FAR Labs. Our previous events include the
 *International Dialogue for AI Safety* that brought together prominent scientists (including 2 Turing Award winners) fr
om around the globe, culminating in a public statement calling for global action on AI safety research and governance. W
e recently hosted the New Orleans Alignment Workshop for over 140 researchers from academia and industry to learn about 
AI safety and find collaborators. For more information on FAR AI’s activities, please visit our latest post.

**About th
e Role**

Our research projects are focussed on ensuring the safe and responsible development of advanced artificial int
elligence systems. As a Technical Lead at FAR AI you will be crucial to driving the quality and execution of these proje
cts to new heights, helping shaping the future of AI safety.

You will work in tandem with Research Scientists, Advisors
 and Engineers both within and outside FAR, providing technical guidance and project stewardship.

**Key responsibilitie
s:**

* **Technical Leadership and Execution**. Be FAR’s point-of-contact for all technical matters related to our resea
rch projects.
* **Strategic Guidance**. Play a key role in the development and direction of technical research projects.

* **Hands-on Leadership**. Lead by example with active involvement in coding, debugging and project development.
* **In
novation**. Run scientific experiments and contribute to the development of scalable implementations of machine learning
 algorithms. You will be credited as an author in submissions to peer reviewed venues (e.g. NeurIPS, ICLR, JMLR)
* **Res
earch Collaboration**. Work closely with Research Scientists to convert theoretical models into practical experiments. F
oster strong relationships with collaborators from various academic labs and research institutions, facilitating the exc
hange of ideas and methodologies.
* **Mentorship and Team Development**. Guide and support the professional growth of th
e engineering team.
* **Learning and Development**. Pursue continual development of your skills. You will have an opport
unity in the role to develop your research taste and high-level views on AI safety research by collaborating with our Re
search Team. We are excited to support our team to grow in other areas, and will have a dedicated Learning & Development
 budget.

**About You**

You should be excited to help make AI systems safe. You are expected to have a minimum of 5 yea
rs experience in software development OR 3 years (PhD equivalent) experience with Machine Learning methodologies.

It is
 essential that you have a:

* Track record of delivering technical projects, ideally in a startup or research environme
nt
* Strong technical expertise in software engineering, with proficiency in at least one object-oriented programming la
nguages (preferably Python).
* Are results-oriented and motivated by impactful research.
* Excellent ability to communic
ate complex technical concepts and lead collaborative efforts.

It is preferable that you have:

**About the Projects**

As a Technical Lead you would drive engineering excell
ence across multiple projects, with examples below:

* Scaling laws for prompt injections. Will advances in capabilities
 from increasing model and data scale help resolve prompt injections or “jailbreaks” in language models, or is progress 
in average-case performance orthogonal to worst-case robustness?
* Robustness of advanced AI systems. Explore adversaria
l training, architectural improvements and other changes to deep learning systems to improve their robustness. We are ex
ploring this both in zero-sum board games and language models.
* Mechanistic interpretability for mesa-optimization. Dev
elop techniques to identify internal planning in models to effectively audit the “goals” of models in addition to their 
external behavior.
* Redteaming of frontier models. Apply our research insights to test for vulnerabilities and limitati
ons of frontier AI models prior to deployment.

NeurIPS24 is nearby and I've got a paper that got rejected last year at ICLR (5/5/6/3). While I'm addressing the feedbac
k from last conference (method was received positively, but they asked for more experimentation), I'm still unsure wheth
er the paper is strong enough to make it to an A\* conference such as NeurIPS. Also, to be honest, I've been working on 
it for almost a year and I feel I want to wrap this up already and look at other ideas.

&#x200B;

I was wondering which
 is better from these two:  


* Submitting to a workshop at NeurIPS or similar (ICLR, ICML..). I assume this should be 
doable with my paper given the feedback at ICLR but I don't know if that's correct?
* Aiming for a conference paper in a
 'lower-tier' venue such as AISTATS, IJCAI or similar. I assume this is more difficult to pull off than the workshop pap
er at NeurIPS but again I'm just guessing?

I am still not a PhD student, but I'm applying for PhDs regularly. Therefore
 I am kinda looking for the option that (in case my paper goes through) would give me more leverage as a PhD candidate i
n my future applications.

all -  [ Career advice for someone hoping to transition to big tech ML after a PhD in ML for science? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1bxt76g/career_advice_for_someone_hoping_to_transition_to/) , 2024-04-16-0910

Hi all, this is going to be a somewhat long post. I am at a crossroads in my career and I highly appreciate any and all 
advice and pointers you can provide. Below I am going to describe my situation, but all my thoughts are a bit hazy and s
o don't shy away from offering your opinions even on topics that I am not asking for advice directly.

**My background:*
* I came to the US from another country to do my PhD. My PhD is in Mechanical Engineering (ME) in a solid (but not, say,
 top 20) university. Before starting my PhD, I did my BS and MS in Aerospace Engineering and worked in 2 aerospace compa
nies in my country for 4 years before coming here. Even though my PhD is in ME, I would say my PhD research is more in M
L than ME. I developed ML tools to solve problems in ME, basically. I am finalizing my PhD this year. At the risk of sou
nding arrogant, I will say that I am a very accomplished PhD student. My publication record is much higher than my peers
 and I have won numerous awards, fellowships, grants etc. I mention these because later on in this thread when I say I a
m trying to go into a research scientist in ML position in big tech, you will know that I have some things on my CV that
 make me believe I will (or should) be taken seriously.

As I said I had a job before coming here and I had a somewhat c
omfortable life. The 2 reasons that I decided to start a PhD were 1) life is much better in the US and a PhD would give 
me a solid path to come here, and 2) I realized that my job is extremely boring and my brain was rotting away. I needed 
to challenge myself and I found that challenge in academia. After four years of working in the industry (2 different eng
ineering companies), I fully realized that I belong in academia doing research.

That was until 1-2 years ago. Around 1-
2 years ago I started questioning if this much commitment to get an academic position is even worth it. In my field, the
 academic market is *extremely* oversaturated. Most open faculty positions get 250+ applications, with 50+ serious appli
cations, out of which 10-20 are shortlisted who all have 3-5 years of postdoc on top of their PhD. I am questioning if s
ubjecting myself to 3-5 years of postdoc with shit pay and high stress and moving from state to state for my next postdo
c every year is worth it. Plus, I have a family and I have an obligation towards my family (and parents) and instead of 
this pipe dream I should be looking for a solid job with a good pay.

**My current situation:** So, I started looking fo
r jobs. But jobs in ME or related fields sound very boring to me. I fully know that I will regret it if I go into an eng
ineering position. And once I go there, it is virtually impossible to come back to academia. Then I will have to endure 
a very miserable life for the rest of my life. On the other hand, I really like ML. I can see myself doing ML for the re
st of my life. If I can do research in ML and get a good pay, then that is literally heaven for me. Because 1) it combin
es my interests: research and ML, 2) it solves my problems (good pay), and 3) it leaves open the option to come back to 
academia later on even if I dislike it (if I can publish papers while away, I can still come back). So, I can't stress h
ow much I want a research scientist position in ML. The problem is, I have no background or training in computer science
. And my ML research is mostly 'applied ML', if that makes sense. My research is ML in nature, but not the kind of ML th
at companies need (say NLP, LLMs, image processing, etc). Rather, my research involves using ML for science. Therefore, 
probably, it will be very hard to convince companies to take my application to these positions seriously.

So after all 
this reflection, earlier this year I started applying for industry positions in ML. I didn't have much of a hope when ap
plying, but I still applied for the heck of it. But to my extreme surprise, a FAANG company offered to interview me for 
a Research Scientist in ML position! This was huuuge for me, and filled me with self confidence. I put everything aside 
to do some leetcode (because, as I said, I have no CS background and these leetcode-type problems are very new to me). I
 passed the screening round and went into full loop. I kept leetcoding and rigorously preparing for the ML system design
 and behavioral interviews. I thought I had done well in all of my interviews, but to my dismay they rejected my applica
tion at the end. This was a huge bummer for me. I was one step away from my dream job and I failed. And to make it worse
, this company was the only company to even interview me, all the other companies (10s of non-FAANG) companies that I ap
plied to, outright rejected me (which was surprising to be honest).

**What now?:** I apologize for the extremely long p
ost with my entire life story. I don't even know what I am saying or what questions I am asking clearly, but whatever it
 is, providing my full background may help. All I know at this point is I am in shambles. Maybe I am aiming too high and
 it was completely expected for this one chance to end up in failure. But I have no idea what I am going to do now. Mayb
e I have become myopic from hoping/looking at this company for so long. But right now, I feel like I should either becom
e a research scientist in ML or nothing at all. In my opinion, **the biggest obstacle in all of this is: I am looking fo
r a job in big tech where I can do research and publish which extremely limits my choices.** There are only 4-5 companie
s in the world that have these kinds of posts and those companies are so prestigious that they have no shortage of prope
r ML researchers applying to their posts. I think it is a miracle that I even got this one interview.

So I guess my mos
t important question to you guys is: **With my background in mind, what is the shortest path for me to obtain a research
 scientist position in ML?** My current plan is to start a postdoc but use my postdoc to publish a paper in NeurIPS/ICML
/ICLR (or at least aim for this) just to show potential recruiters that even though my PhD is in ME, I have what it take
s to do the research scientist jobs.

Thank you for looking at my post.

TLDR: Delusional (?) ME PhD graduate who thinks
 he is worthy of a research position in pure ML with those amazing FAANG salaries asking how he can get to his dream.

A new study has uncovered that a significant fraction of peer reviews for top AI conferences in 2023-2024 likely include
d substantial AI-generated content from models like ChatGPT.

Using a novel statistical technique, researchers estimated
 the percentage of text generated by AI in large collections of documents. Analyzing peer reviews, they found:

* 10.6% 
of ICLR 2024 reviews had significant AI content
* 9.1% for NeurIPS 2023
* 6.5% for CoRL 2023
* 16.9% for EMNLP 2023

In 
contrast, only 1-2% of pre-ChatGPT reviews from 2022 and earlier were flagged as having substantial AI contribution.

So
me key findings:

1. AI-heavy reviews tended to come in close to the deadline
2. Fewer scholarly citations in AI-flavore
d reviews
3. Reviewers with AI-tinged reviews engaged less in author discussion
4. AI content made reviews more semantic
ally homogeneous
5. Lower reviewer confidence correlated with higher AI estimates

The study, I think, raises some quest
ions for proactive policy development in academia around responsible AI use in research. AI may be eroding the quality a
nd integrity of peer review through these 'shadow' influences. Open questions include:

* Should AI assistance in peer r
eview be disclosed?
* How should we incentivize good practices despite AI temptations?
* Can we preserve intellectual di
versity under AI homogenization?
* Should we rethink credit for hybrid human/AI knowledge work?

Overall, an interesting
 empirical glimpse into AI's rapidly growing tendrils in the foundations of scientific quality control! I thought the ap
proach of measuring the frequency of certain AI wording 'ticks' made a lot of sense (some of the adjectives GPT4 uses, f
or example, are clear tells).

I'm curious to read the comments on this one! I have a [much more detailed summary availa
ble here](https://aimodels.substack.com/p/new-study-finds-up-to-17-of-ai-conference) as well if you're interested, and t
he original paper is [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07183.pdf).

Though I mailed to all authors, I couldn't receive any reply...

&#x200B;

I really enjoyed reading paper, “Compositiona
l Visual Generation with Energy Based Models” (NeurIPS\`20; [https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06030](https://arxiv.org/abs/200
4.06030)).

While I am following the idea in the paper, I am facing a problem in understanding the equation (8) in the p
aper.

According to the paper's notation, the EBM is defined as (1):

[Eq. \(1\)](https://preview.redd.it/lnerbdlm58pc1.
png?width=202&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7ce768304cafa8e0fb88202466ad7cf40d9d3e8)

i.e.,, the *energy function*, E\_\\theta
(x), is defined as the negative term on top of the exponent.

&#x200B;

In eq. (3) below, authors defines SGLD step for 
acquiring samples from any energy based model (EBM).

Next, according to 'concept disjunction' proposed by authors, the 
union-ized probability densities are defined in (7), in the form of the exponential of log-sum-exp of different EBMs' *e
nergy function*s.

https://preview.redd.it/sas3f4yg58pc1.png?width=1005&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bb0aa67cf2767ede091102ce
22965e8c8bdbe7c

From (7), I understood that the unionized energy function is accordingly -logsumexp(-E(x|c1), ...),  
t
hus corresponding SGLD should have plus sign.  
However, in the paper, authors stated the SGLD with ***minus sign***, an
d I've lost...

After looking through the official code implementation,   
([https://github.com/yilundu/ebm\_composition
ality/blob/c7ac54366d2d5a15f71871448bd720bf5b3eb82d/celeba\_combine.py#L150C9-L150C32](https://github.com/yilundu/ebm_co
mpositionality/blob/c7ac54366d2d5a15f71871448bd720bf5b3eb82d/celeba_combine.py#L150C9-L150C32))  
I found that the combi
ned energy function derivation of mine ( E(x|\\cup\_i c\_i) ) seems to be correct,  
according to the assignment of the 
\`e\_pos\` variable in the code.

&#x200B;

Still, I'd like to acquire some clarification on this flow.  
Can anybody sk
im through this post and check my thought?

Thank you in advance!

I unfortunately got denied from Online Stanford MS in CS Today. I was fairly confident in my application. I had 4.00/4.0
0 GPA (ranked 1st in my graduation class from decent US college), ML Engineer at FAANG, published a paper in NeurIPS. My
 references include Dean of Engineering, My college Prof (Oxford grad) and my manager from work - MIT (PhD). I had alrea
dy got rejected 2 years ago, since then I made a publication switched to an ML oriented role and tailored my referrals a
ccordingly. It makes sense that a lot of people flooded in to AI track this year but I really want to get a sense of oth
er profiles who got admitted this year.

Maybe next year I will try again :/

all -  [ [D] papers that only evaluate on cifar10 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1bhp54a/d_papers_that_only_evaluate_on_cifar10/) , 2024-04-16-0910
```
Hi everyone!

While reviewing for NeurIPS 2024, one of the things I keep noticing is that a lot of papers only evaluate 
on datasets of very small size, like Cifar-10. his feels weird to me: I consider Cifar10 to be a toy-dataset and testbed
 for my methods, not something I'd use to show that my method actually works/is relevant in practice. So my first intuit
ion is always 'this approach probably does not scale to larger datasets'. I mean, ImageNet is 12 years old now, and I've
 personally been giving results on imagenet for my papers since ~8 years. most computer vision applications I know requi
re larger resolutions than just 32x32. it's also my impression that almost all of the 'good' papers I read have results 
on larger scale data. But given how often I encounter this situation, I have to wonder: am  I just working in a very pri
vileged environment, or are the manuscript-authors just lazy? How much faith do you have in papers that only evaluate on
 MNIST and CIFAR10?
