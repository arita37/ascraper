Greetings fellow researchers,

I am 27, currently working remotely at a healthcare IT company based in Silicon Valley  (
6+ years in industrial research) where I apply deep learning methods and large language models. I recently received an e
xciting opportunity to pursue a PhD at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in a similar research area. 

While I a
m grateful for my current position and compensation, Have published in NeurIPS, EMNLP, ACL, ACM etc (NLP) with really go
od citations under company. I feel unsatisfied with the learning opportunities available in company & industry.

I am st
rongly considering pursuing the DTU PhD program full-time, but wanted to get perspectives from others before making a de
cision. How strong is DTU's AI research community?

 Given the rapid advances in large language models, is now an ideal 
time to immerse myself in academic research? There are many topics that interest me, including fairness, ethics, halluci
nations, quantization, specialized domains like healthcare/finance, and federated learning combined with LLMs.

Would ap
preciate any insights on whether moving into academia would be a wise choice at this stage versus remaining in industry.
 I welcome any suggestions or considerations I should keep in mind. 

Thank you for taking the time to share your though
ts!

NeurIPS 2023 paper reviews are visible on OpenReview.  See this [tweet](https://twitter.com/francoisfleuret/status/16864
64712534638592). I thought to create a discussion thread for us to discuss any issue/complain/celebration or anything el
se.

There is so much noise in the reviews every year. Some good work that the authors are proud of might get a low scor
e because of the noisy system, given that NeurIPS is growing so large these years. We should keep in mind that the work 
is still valuable no matter what the score is.

Hi there, 

I am a student at Mathematical Modelling and Computation at Technical University of Denmark. I would like to
 attend the Machine Learning Summer School in 2024 ([http://mlss.cc/](http://mlss.cc/)). 

The Machine Learning Summer S
chool has as admission requirement that I provide an extended abstract on: 'A project reproducing the results of a paper
 published by someone else in a top conference or journal in ML or applied ML (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, EC
CV, AAAI, ACL, EMNLP, TPAMI, JMLR, Nature, Nature Communications, Science, Science Advances, PNAS) in the past 3 years.'


Would anyone out there like to join forces and see if we can find an interesting paper in one of the mentioned journal
s/proceedings and then reproduce their results? I am mainly interested in time series and image recognition, but I am op
en for suggestions. 

Also, if you have any ideas about good approaches to this project, I am all ears. I have found it 
a bit overwhelming to find a suitable paper.

Hope to hear from you :).

So for the past six months I have been working on a domain adaptation research problem. I wanted to inspect/understand t
he inherent capability of SSL methods to extract domain invariant features. For this purpose I have been conducting diff
erent kinds of experiments.There is a very nice library called [lightly](https://github.com/lightly-ai/lightly)  that co
ntains the implementations of all published SSL methods, This made things very easy for me in terms of writing code. I a
m not a PhD student or don't have significant research experience. My guide/mentor is very interested in the work I'm do
ing and she aims to publish our work in somewhere like a NeurIPS, ICML or so.

Probably because of my lack of experience
, I am overlooking into things or I am genuinely concerned. I just don't want to make stupid coding or code related erro
rs and report wrong results.  I just want to know if its mandatory to use the official implementations of every method I
'm benchmarking.or example, SimCLR's official implementation is in Tensorflow and I am using PyTorch. Using official imp
lementation would introduce these kind of bottlenecks and slow down my experimentation process. Any advices on this woul
d be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Hey, all. I just created a new subreddit, /r/LearningMachines. The goal of the subreddit is to be entirely research-focu
sed. With that being said, I'm hoping the research discussed in /r/LearningMachines will be broader than just papers sub
mitted to ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR/CVPR. With that being the case, the only rule for submissions is that they must be research 
involving machine learning. Here, 'research' means either an academic manuscript/technical report (e.g., posted on arXiv
, a journal website, or a conference website; note that this does not include Medium posts) *or* a conference presentati
on where conferences can be either academic or applied/industrial in nature (e.g., PyData). You're a biologist who used 
machine learning to classify species using their DNA? Share it! You're a data scientist who used graph neural networks t
o model customer interactions? Submit your conference talk! Links to project webpages/code repositories for papers are a
cceptable, but they must be clearly tied to a singular piece of research.

Note that software packages are *not* conside
red research by themselves in this context. If the software package has an associated research product (i.e., paper or c
onference presentation), then that research product should be the link for the submission.

Lastly, I also want to activ
ely encourage a culture of self-promotion. Reddit is the only social network where reach is relatively flat, i.e., your 
research can be seen by a wide audience regardless of your seniority or institution, so this subreddit is an opportunity
 for junior scientists and/or researchers at less prominent institutions to share the cool things they're working on. In
 that spirit, I want to actively encourage every user to submit all of their own research products from the past 12 mont
hs to the subreddit to get the community going.

Hey guys. I am a rising senior starting to apply for jobs for after I graduate next spring. My main goal is to get a PhD
, but I am applying to SWE positions as a backup in case that doesn't go well (my field is extremely competitive).

I ha
ven't done a single company internship throughout my undergraduate years - everything I have done has been research. I w
ork in Natural Language Processing, and I have a publication at a top conference and a first-author one in review at ano
ther (NeurIPS) now, so I'd say I'm pretty accomplished on that front for an undergraduate.

But I'm not sure how strongl
y SWE people will view these accolades/if they will even care, and instead will reject me for not having worked at a com
pany before. Is this the case, or should my publications be decent enough that I can get interviews at top places?

The 
reason I ask is I'm not sure if its worth it practicing leetcode for interviews I might not even get, when I could also 
be spending that time putting extra work into my research and preparing for PhD applications.

Thanks for the help!
