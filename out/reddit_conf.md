I'm not sure if the quote refers to the [MATH dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/math), which
 was introduced in [this paper (PDF file)](https://datasets-benchmarks-proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2021/fil

>**We also evaluated humans on MATH**, and found that a computer science PhD student who does not especially like

EDIT: Another quote from the MATH-related paper:

>Human-Level Performance. 
To provide a rough but informative comparison to human-level performance, we randomly sampled 20 problems from the MATH 
test set and gave them to humans. We artificially require that the participants have 1 hour to work on the problems and 
must perform calculations by hand. All participants are university students. One participant who does not like mathemati
cs got 8/20 = 40% correct. A participant ambivalent toward mathematics got 13/20. Two participants who like mathematics 
got 14/20 and 15/20. A participant who got a perfect score on the AMC 10 exam and attended USAMO several times got 18/20
. A three-time IMO gold medalist got 18/20 = 90%, though missed questions were exclusively due to small errors of arithm
etic.

**Introduction**



In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, understanding how neural networks process 
visual data has become a crucial area of research.  
The AlexNet paper from 2019 offers profound insights into how deep 
convolutional neural networks operate, shedding light on the striking parallels between artificial and biological neural
 networks.

This exploration delves into the intricate connections between AI models and the human visual cortex, levera
ging recent studies and historical perspectives.

**Understanding AlexNet**

**AlexNet**, introduced in 2012, revolution
ized the field of computer vision.  
This deep convolutional neural network demonstrated unprecedented accuracy in image
 classification tasks, sparking a surge in AI research.  
But beyond its technical prowess, AlexNet revealed something p
rofound: its architecture and processing mechanisms bore an uncanny resemblance to the human visual cortex.

c/paper_files/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf)

**The Human Visual Cortex**

The human visual
 cortex is a complex network of neurons organized into **columns and hypercolumns**, systematically processing different
 aspects of visual information such as orientation, color, and motion. This organization is crucial for interpreting the
 vast array of visual stimuli we encounter daily.

**Bridging the Gap: AI and the Visual Cortex**

Recent research undersco
res the remarkable similarities between deep neural networks and the visual cortex. Here are some key findings:

1. **Hi
erarchical Representations**: Deep neural networks, much like the visual cortex, develop hierarchical representations. T
his structure is crucial for accurately predicting brain activity in visual tasks.
   * **Reference**: [Brain-optimized 
deep neural network models of human visual areas](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38674-4)
2. **Cortical Magn
ification and Retinotopic Organization**: Convolutional neural networks mimic major organizational principles of the ear
ly visual cortex, including cortical magnification and retinotopic mapping.

tworks develop major organizational principles of early visual cortex](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-59376-

apping between AI tasks and brain regions, aligning with the ventral and dorsal visual streams.

eiling functions of the visual cortex using task-specific deep neural networks](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/a
rticle?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1009267)
4. **Stabilization Across Conditions**: The visual cortex maintains stable fir
ing rates across different conditions, a trait mirrored by deep neural networks in their processing stability.
   * **Re
ference**: [Rapid and active stabilization of visual cortical firing rates across light–dark transitions](https://www.nc
bi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6731644/)

**Implications for AI and Neuroscience**

The parallels between AI and the hum
an visual cortex not only enhance our understanding of artificial neural networks but also provide invaluable insights i
nto the workings of the human brain. This synergy could lead to breakthroughs in both fields, paving the way for more ad
vanced AI models and deeper comprehension of human cognition.

**Conclusion**

The journey from AlexNet to the present r
eveals a potentially profound convergence between artificial and biological intelligence.

The parallels between AlexNet
's architecture and the human visual cortex are more than just intriguing – they're unsettling. It's as if, in our quest
 to build intelligent machines, we've inadvertently stumbled upon the blueprint of our own minds, a blueprint that revea
ls the emergent nature of the mind itself.

By studying these parallels, we can unlock new possibilities for AI developm
ent and deepen our understanding of the human mind. As we continue to explore this intersection, the future holds exciti
ng potential for innovation and discovery.

Perplexity 07-07-2024

\[ Prompt (#1) :  
i need papers that show the direct correlation of the outside phen
omena with the visual cortex firing, i believe it is called the cortex movie, im not sure, help me out here!

Perplexity
 (Answer):

Based on the search results provided, there does not appear to be a direct correlation between external phen
omena and the firing patterns in the visual cortex referred to as 'cortex movie'.  
The search results focus more on the
 organization and encoding of visual information in the visual cortex, as well as the stability and representational dri
ft of neural firing rates and temporal spiking sequences in response to natural movie stimuli.

The key findings from th
e search results are:

1 -( Temporal spiking sequences in the visual cortex carry more unique information about natural 
movies compared to population firing rates . Temporal patterns show little representational drift over time, whereas fir
ing rates exhibit substantial drift.

( [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.27.546669v2.full.pdf](https://w

information about natural movies)

2 -The visual cortex is organized into columns and hypercolumns that systematically p
rocess different aspects of visual information like orientation, eye of origin, and color

Tem
poral spiking sequences in visual cortex carry unique information about natural movies)

3 - Decorrelated or spatially u
ncorrelated visual stimuli evoke weaker and less reliable responses in the visual cortex of awake mice compared to natur
al, spatially correlated stimuli.

4 - Firing rates of visual cortex neurons are remarkably stable over both long and short timescal
es, even during transitions between light and dark conditions. However, pairwise correlations between neurons are signif
icantly higher during natural vision in the light compared to darkness.

The search results do not directly ad
dress a 'cortex movie' phenomenon. They focus more on the encoding and dynamics of visual representations in the visual 
cortex in response to natural movie stimuli, rather than a direct correlation between external phenomena and visual cort
ex firing patterns. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions! \]

\[ Prompt (#2) :  
  
so
 what do you suggest we search for?  
here is what is going on, i have an intuition, after reading the alexanet2019 pape
r.  
How the neural network reads and processes the data is eerily similar to what is happening in the human visual cort
ex neural networks.  
Im looking for evidence, more specific how it maps identically.

Perplexity (Answer):  
Based on t
he search results, there does appear to be a strong correspondence between the organization and function of deep neural 
networks trained on visual tasks and the structure and processing in the human visual cortex:  
  
1 - ( Deep neural net
works optimized for visual tasks learn representations that align layer depth with the hierarchy of visual areas in the 
primate brain, suggesting hierarchical representations are necessary to accurately predict brain activity in the visual 
system.

ed deep neural network models of human visual areas learn non-hierarchical representations.)

2 - Convolutional neural n
etworks develop major organizational properties of the visual cortex, including cortical magnification, eccentricity-dep
endent receptive field sizes, and retinotopic organization.  
  
( [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-59376-x](

3 - Comparing fMRI responses in the human v
isual cortex to activations of deep neural networks optimized on different scene perception tasks reveals a structured m
apping between DNN tasks and brain regions along the ventral and dorsal visual streams.  
Low-level visual tasks map to 
early visual regions, 3D scene perception tasks map to the dorsal stream, and semantic tasks map to the ventral stream

4 - Deep neural
 networks trained to directly predict brain activity in human visual areas V1-V4 learn hierarchical representations, eve
n when not required by the architecture, suggesting hierarchical representations may be a general property of brain-like
 visual processing.

( [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38674-4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-3
8674-4)  
Brain-optimized deep neural network models of human visual areas learn non-hierarchical representationsBrain-o
ptimized deep neural network models of human visual areas learn non-hierarchical representations. )  
In summary, the se
arch results provide strong evidence that the hierarchical, modular organization and processing in deep neural networks 
trained on visual tasks closely mirrors the structure and function of the human visual cortex.

The mapping between neur
al network layers and visual cortical areas is striking, and suggests deep learning models may be powerful tools for und
erstanding the neural code underlying human visual perception.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additi
onal questions! I'd be happy to discuss this fascinating topic further.

# Introduction

For centuries, the properties of the human central nervous system (CNS) or human neural networks (HNNs) 
remained a mystery, a tangled web of intuition and bias. 

However, with the advent of artificial neural networks (ANNs)
 like AlexNet, we now have a unique opportunity to deconstruct these processes, to separate the signal from the evolutio
nary noise, and perhaps, even improve upon the flawed design.

The process of learning, whether in ANNs like AlexNet or 
in humans HNNs, involves iterative modifications that lead to significant emergent properties.

By examining these proce
sses, we can gain deeper insights into the unique and shared aspects of cognition between humans and AI.

# Iterative Le
arning in AlexNet (2019)
[ https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-P
aper.pdf ]

1. **Initial State**: AlexNet begins with random weights and biases, representing a blank slate.
2. **Exposu
re to Data**: It processes a large dataset of labeled images.
3. **Forward Propagation and Feature Extraction**: The net
work identifies and extracts key features through convolutional layers.
4. **Error Calculation and Backpropagation**: Er
rors are calculated and propagated back, adjusting weights and biases.
5. **Iteration and Refinement**: This process is 
repeated, continuously refining the network.
6. **Convergence**: The network eventually converges, accurately categorizi
ng new images.

# Iterative Learning in Human CNS (HNNs)

1. **Initial State**: Humans start with an existing neural net
work shaped by genetics and prior experiences.
2. **Exposure to Information**: Humans are exposed to new information thr
ough various forms.
3. **Sensory Processing and Integration**: The central nervous system HNNs processes and integrates 
this information.
4. **Practice, Feedback, and Neural Plasticity**: Through practice and feedback, neural pathways are s
trengthened and reorganized.
5. **Iteration and Adaptation**: This iterative process leads to improved proficiency.
6. *
*Mastery**: Over time, humans become skilled in the trade, optimizing their neural pathways.

**Emergent Properties in A
lexNet**:

* **Pattern Recognition**: AlexNet develops the ability to recognize complex patterns in images.
* **Generali
zation**: It can generalize from the training data to categorize unseen images.
* **Adaptability**: The network can adap
t to new types of data.
* **Scalability**: AlexNet’s architecture allows it to scale and handle larger datasets with inc
reased complexity.

**Emergent Properties in Human** HNNs **(CNS)**:

* **Intuition and Creativity**: Humans develop int
uitive understanding and creative problem-solving abilities.
* **Contextual Understanding**: The HNNs integrates sensory
 information with prior knowledge.
* **Adaptability and Flexibility**: Humans can adapt to new environments and learn ne
w skills rapidly.
* **Emotional and Social Intelligence**: The HNNs supports complex emotional responses and social inte
ractions.

**Comparative Analysis**:

* **Pattern Recognition vs. Intuition**: AlexNet uses mathematical computations; h
umans use intuition.
* **Generalization vs. Contextual Understanding**: AlexNet generalizes from data; humans add contex
tual layers.
* **Adaptability**: Both systems adapt.
* **Creativity and Emotional Intelligence**: Humans possess creativ
ity and emotional intelligence, emergent properties not fully replicated by ANNs.

**Implications and Insights**:

Inter
estingly, while HNNs excel at emotional responses (often to the detriment of logical decision making), they are remarkab
ly inefficient at processing raw data. ANNs, on the other hand...

1. **Learning Mechanisms**: Understanding these emerg
ent properties enhances our comprehension of learning mechanisms in both systems.
2. **Educational Techniques**: Insight
s from AI learning can inform human education.
3. **AI and Human Collaboration**: Recognizing the strengths and limitati
ons of each system can lead to more effective collaboration.

all -  [ Algoverse Honest Review ](https://www.reddit.com/r/summerprogramresults/comments/1dso17p/algoverse_honest_review/) , 2024-07-18-0911
```
Hey all!
So originally I was accepted into Algoverse for the Neurips track and was browsing on reddit to see if it was a
 scam, and there weren’t really any full reviews so I thought I’d share my thoughts! I think Kevin will be able to deduc
e who I am from this review, so hi Kevin!
Is it a scam? No.
Is it a bit pricy? Yes, I paid for it with money from my job
 🥲

The first part of the program is lectures, which I think were pretty informative and gave me a good background on AI
. The lectures were also used for meetings so I thought that was pretty useful.
The second part is working within a grou
p and making a research paper. So my group consisted of students who were all underclassmen without much research and AI
 experience, which is fine but I was pretty much the leader of the group. I love my team but I feel like I had to push t
hem a bit and really guide them. All of us avoided the actual code of the paper like the plague, until the deadline was 
coming up and I took one for the team. This could be avoided by the way, as Kevin gives you the option to switch teams p
retty early on.
The third part is mentorship. In my opinion, this is the most valuable part. Kevin was pretty helpful in
 providing insight on our paper and was always happy to help even though we definitely were not following our deadlines.
 He’s a really cool person and I can tell he puts a lot of work into the program. I have no bad things to say about him,
 he’s great.

To take the most out of this experience: I would say to stay on track with the workload, which in hindsigh
t wasn’t too bad and ask for help when needed. I know I was a bit hesitant in asking for help, not because Kevin was unw
elcoming, but because I was shy, so be unafraid. I also think people who come into this experience with previous ML/AI/p
ython experience gain the most from this. Don’t get me wrong, I had zero Python experience before this and was able to m
ake a pretty decent paper but it took a lot of trial and error.
I also think you have to be a bit self motivated to see 
this program through, and to really put yourself out there in communicating.

I have done research for the past two year
s with AP research and independent research, and I can say this has been the best paper I have ever written. I wish I wo
uld’ve found out about this program sooner so I could’ve done it earlier.

It’s not the most selective program, but it o
pens doors to research, networking, and some opportunities, for example Kevin sent out applications for a collaboration 
project with Umich, I didn’t get in but it was cool to see.

Overall: Happy with my experience, if you don’t mind the pr
ice, I would recommend.

```
I'm a 1st year PhD student working on a hot area in ML (3 guesses as to what lol) and the past year has been absolutely 
brutal for me on a personal level. Every single weekday, I check the daily arxiv digest that hits my inbox, and there ar
e consistently always 3-5 new papers that are relevant to my topic, especially recently given that everyone is now relea
sing their Neurips submissions.

No paper has directly scooped what I've been working on so far, but there were so many 
near-misses lately that I'm worried that either (a) it's only a matter of time, and I should work even faster to get a p
reprint out; or (b) even if I do get a paper out in the near future, it's one among a dozen similar titles that it won't
 get much traction. Some papers even have my advisor's name on them since she is a Big Famous Professor and is very amen
able to collaboration (I sometimes think because she pitches the same ideas to multiple people, there is inevitably some
 local scooping going on). These circumstances drive up my anxiety, since I feel that speed is really the best comparati
ve advantage here; it's all speed iteration from idea generation to execution to publication.

IDK, I felt like I was so
 prolific and accomplished and ahead of the curve as an undergrad, and now it's been a year and I'm still struggling to 
get a meaningful and novel idea out....is anyone else in the same boat? Does anyone have helpful advice...for dealing wi
th the stress of fast publication cycles, or for generally struggling through the early years of research, or for how to
 think faster and better? Thanks for listening to my (possibly hideously naive) rant....

```
so i have a phd in chem and a research focus in comp bio (drug discovery and such). I am up-to-date with ML literture in
 my field and have even applied some of the ML methods in my project. But I havent developed a foundation model or publi
sbed in NeurIPS or any ML journal. Currently doing a post doc (in the US [1st year], and no publication yet from my post
 doc, i do have several from my phd just not in ML). Current boss also wont touch ML because they are an ML denier. I ha
ve been actively looking for a job in the US primarily. However the job market is tough and it has been nothing but reje
ctions. It seems like all people want these days are ML engineers and I am unfortunately not one of the lucky ones. I fe
el like my life has been on pause for so long now. I live by myself and have no family. Feels like with how things are g
oing I will probably never have one either. 

I tried doing those stupid ML tutorials but they are boring and often skip
s the most important part (data processing, featurization, normalization etc). All of ML math is always hidden behind ja
rgons so it just hurts everytime to open up an ml paper and feel so far behind. I even tried applying to quantitative ro
les in finance but still nothing.

The other part that makes life difficult is that I am not from the US and is on STEM-
OPT. So I guess is this the end for me? I just waste away in my post doc and then go back and do nothing? Or go for a ma
sters in CS/ML in hopes maybe that gives me better opportunity?

Sorry for my rant. Any advice helps thanks.

```
There is a somewhat [duplicated question](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/olmq3m/d_difference_between_
aaai_iclr_and_aistats/) here, but I would like to bring this topic up again, since the September/October deadline is app
roaching and things might have changed now.

The big 3 ML conferences are ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR which divide the year into 3
 deadlines. However, AISTATS also has a decent reputation. The deadlines of ICLR and AISTATS are quite close, so many pe
ople have to decide to submit their work to which of them.

ICLR rises so quickly because of popularity in deep learning
 (DL), but people nowadays seem to treat it the same as ICML/NeurIPS, and there seem to be quite some non-DL and theoret
ical ML papers there.

**Questions:** For purely empirical DL papers, it seems like a no-brainer to submit them to ICLR.
 What about (1) ML papers that have more theoretical results, or (2) ML papers with no DL (e.g., statistical ML)? **What
 are the pros and cons of submitting these works to ICLR and AISTATS?** Some aspects to consider:

* For these kinds of 
work, will AISTATS carry less prestige or receive less attention from the ML community?
* How are the experiences of sub
mitting theoretical works to ICLR? (E.g., will reviewers there ask for many experiments?)
* Does industry/academia count
 more for ICLR, or treat ICLR and AISTATS the same (for more theoretical works)?

**Disclaimer:** Please stop saying 'th
e work itself is more important than the publication venue', which is obviously true but not terribly informative.

**Paper abstract**

>Multi-vector retrieval models such as ColBERT \[Khattab and Zaharia, 2020\] allow token-level
 interactions between queries and documents, and hence achieve state of the art on many information retrieval benchmarks
. However, their non-linear scoring function cannot be scaled to millions of documents, necessitating a three-stage proc
ess for inference: retrieving initial candidates via token retrieval, accessing all token vectors, and scoring the initi
al candidate documents. The non-linear scoring function is applied over all token vectors of each candidate document, ma
king the inference process complicated and slow.  
In this paper, we aim to simplify the multi-vector retrieval by rethi
nking the role of token retrieval. We present XTR, ConteXtualized Token Retriever, which introduces a simple, yet novel,
 objective function that encourages the model to retrieve the most important document tokens first. The improvement to t
oken retrieval allows XTR to rank candidates only using the retrieved tokens rather than all tokens in the document, and
 enables a newly designed scoring stage that is two-to-three orders of magnitude cheaper than that of ColBERT. On the po
pular BEIR benchmark, XTR advances the state-of-the-art by 2.8 nDCG@10 without any distillation. Detailed analysis confi
rms our decision to revisit the token retrieval stage, as XTR demonstrates much better recall of the token retrieval sta
ge compared to ColBERT.

iew me to be a 'better fit' for big pharma/biotech post-graduation.

I became interested in the comp bio side of things 
research-wise as it is more meaningful, but from a career standpoint, I am getting a little nervous from a flexibility s
tandpoint (e.g. if I want to go back into big tech after graduation). Since we publish computational approaches for biol
ogy, albeit very heavily in biology/medicine-related journals (e.g. Nature Comm, Nature BioE/Genetics/Medicine/etc, Geno
me Biology) (and much less in ML conferences like NeurIPS ICML ICLR CVPR), it 'seems' as if we are much less productive 
than other CS labs from big tech companies. I have heard in general CS that is not comp bio, people seem to treat confer
ence and journal papers roughly equally, while in biology people treat journal papers much more heavily since they take 
longer to publish and require more experimental rigor.

Specifically, it seems that students from other labs regularly p
ublish \~3-4 conference papers a year from top ML venues, whereas we only get <1 journal publication a year (which is re
ally good for non-ML fields, but somehow in ML people seem to be 'playing the publication count' game). I am personally 
a little worried that big tech companies like FAANG won't understand the time and rigor needed for journal publications 
in comp bio (since for the time it takes to publish 1 journal paper in a biology venue (with peer review+revisions+etc),
 one could publish 2-4 ML papers if lucky). Furthermore, I am not researching pure ML, but ML applied to biology data, a
nd most ML applied to biology data is not a fancy Deep Learning model since they are not much biological data available 
to train a big model. Most of the time, my models are simple NN, random forest, and logistic regression.

Any thoughts? 
Maybe I shouldn't be worried since this might not actually be an issue in reality? Should I do a more ML-focused PhD ins
tead if I know I want to go to into tech?

This is my first year as a PhD student and I am currently attending the Naacl conference in Mexico with a poster attache
d to a workshop and I definitely want my next papers to pass in for conferences in such venues. But I am still confused 
on how the depth of the experiments should be.  it feels like you have to be associated with cliche labs in order to get
 in...

Well, any comments and suggestions will be helpful

Well, this will be my third paper and it is published in NAACL as a poster, not yet get into the main conference. For th
ose who got into main conferences of those well known venues what are the main things that put you there? Sorry this is 
my first year PhD so I am kind of noob at this.

Hi everyone! Thank you so much for taking the time to read my post. This is going to be long but I didn't know how to ma
ke it any shorter so here it goes.

So, at the moment, I am at the end of my first year in a CS PhD program in a decent-
ish state school in the United States. I had initially done my applications with Quantum Complexity/Quantum Simulations 
in mind but 2 things have changed/ refined/ put me back to my initial interests. 1. The only professor I wanted to work 
with -- the only quantum prof -- said he doesn't have funding and the department is super weird in that it dislikes if a
dvisors are not funding you research; this also means no summer funding which is a huge bummer as an international stude
nt. 2. While reading a lot of quantum papers across different subareas I found myself gravitate towards algorithmic prob
lems/ problems related to simulations etc that have both theory and applied parts, and also because I personally cannot 
just be satisfied with theory (I realized) and want applied parts as well and in quantum everything at the moment is at 
the mercy of experimental physicists (wish I did physics).

However, this isn't a drastic turn because my original inter
ests lied in problems in the realm of applied mathematics -- numerical methods, PDEs, etc. but couldn't pursue it becaus
e no one was doing it at my UG institution. No one was doing quantum either but I just taught it to myself in the hopes 
that my UG advisor will follow through with his word of connecting me with his friends working in quantum research which
 did not happen for one reason or another (bygones are bygones) and I basically ended up applying for a PhD without an L
OR from a guy who does work in the field which led me to being wait-listed at most of my top choices.

Now, I am looking
 to move to working in algorithms, numerical linear algebra and on problems that relate to scientific computing. However
, the BIG issue is no one even does algorithms at the institution where I am at..like there is barely any theory.  This 
led to some bad mental health state for the a couple months at the start of the year -- being in a department where you 
are not interested in anyone's work. However, I was able to get out of it and started to researching and studying things
 on my own. I was always interested in Ising models, spin glasses, and phase transitions etc and I have been studying up
 on literature that build up from graph theory and connect to topics in statistical mechanics. I am also trying to find 
research avenues in areas related to algorithms and simulation of many-body systems. There are lots of exciting work aro
und using continuous methods in optimization which appears to be very interesting and I am studying up and building up m
y background so I can better interface with those works. At the moment, I am studying from these set of lecture notes: [
https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/18/sp18/18.408/index.html](https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/18/sp18/18.408/index.html) 
. Some of the work that have me interested are: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.00709](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.00709); [h
ttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.10959](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.10959); [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.00755](https://arxiv.org
/pdf/1611.00755); [https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3564246.3585142](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3564246.358514
2);  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.03963.

So, at the moment I am reading up from various lecture notes to get familiar wit
h the literature so I can start reading papers and maybe come up with idea (at least that is the plan now), and I am als
o starting to contribute to Julia since the Julia lab looks like the optimal place with the type of interests I have. Ob
viously, I will have to manage all this while I manage my graduate school requirements at my current institution.

I wou
ld love it if I could work with somebody or work under someone as an RA doing research and building up my research profi
le in these areas.. I guess we'll see.

I am basically looking for advice on if folks here feel if this is a good/optima
l way to go about it or there are other things that I should do. I am also attaching my cv with the post so you could ge
t an idea of my background. I really wish I had some theory work to show for but it just didn't happen because no one at
 my UG uni was doing it. Obviously, I could have tried harder to connect to people back then but I guess it's okay.. I r
eally want do some good research under advisors whose work I admire and it would be great if you folks would be kind eno
ugh to give me some pointers.
