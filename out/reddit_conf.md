Th
is past weekend at NeurIPS, Valence Labs and Recursion won first, second and third place awards at the Foundation Models
 for Science workshop. These foundation models offer breakthroughs in leveraging machine learning to better model the in
tersection of biology and chemistry necessary to improve and scale AI drug discovery. 

**First place** was awarded to a
 paper on MolPhenix, a foundation model that can predict the effect of any given molecule and concentration pair on phen
otypic cell assays and cell morphology by integrating phenomics data with chemistry data. Over the past decade, Recursio
n has generated billions of phenomics images through automated, high-throughput experiments. Paired with new phenomics f
oundation models like Phenom-1, Recursion can extract meaningful representations from these high-dimensional images to b
uild Maps of Biology, allowing them to navigate which molecules and genes map to the same space of morphological changes
. MolPhenix mines that rich data and delivers 10X improvement over previous methods – from 7.9% to 77.3% on the Top 1% r
ecall of active molecules. **Paper:** [https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2409.08302](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2409.08302?fbclid

**Second pla
ce** was awarded to a paper on Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as
 building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. The model uses an unsupervised pre-training a
pproach using offline drug-like molecule datasets, conditioning A-GFNs on inexpensive yet informative molecular descript
ors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve 
as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. **

```
This was my first year at NeurIPS. It’s inspiring to see so much cutting-edge research being presented, but something tr
oubling caught my attention during the poster sessions that I feel compelled to share, especially given [the recent inci
dent with Rosalind Picard](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1hdxbru/d_what_happened_at_neurips/).

Gett
ing a paper accepted at NeurIPS is a huge achievement. Each poster spot represents so much hard work and is highly covet
ed.

I saw two posters that *shouldn’t* have been there, and it has left me wondering about the exploitation of these sp
aces.

**Illegal Poster #1:** [Generative Boba](https://x.com/BoyuanChen0/status/1778565953627775453). This was a “cute,
 look at me” poster, but it also featured a QR code linking to the creator’s X/Twitter. While the poster itself was plac
ed on a side wall in the exhibition hall and not in an official poster spot (when I saw it anyway), it still felt odd. W
hy did they make this poster? Was this about sparking joy, or gaining attention and followers?

[Illegal Poster #1: Gene
rative Boba.](https://preview.redd.it/u3vfvszkoy6e1.jpg?width=3363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c09ddda45e0ac002223dadf0eac4
165bfdc0433)

**Illegal Poster #2:** [Benchmarkthing](https://x.com/xdotli/status/1867823150068535797)**.** This was far
 more concerning. It blatantly promoted a new AI startup, mentioning funding by a prominent figure in our field, Jeff De
an. Unlike the boba poster, this could visually pass as a real NeurIPS poster. Probably most passersby didn’t give it a 
second thought, but the poster's presenter (who is also the company’s founder) was essentially promoting his new startup
, sometimes to a significant audience size AND across *multiple* poster sessions. This feels deceptive and exploitative 
— gaming the trust of the community to cheatingly gain visibility in a sacred academic space.

[Illegal Poster #2: Bench
markthing.](https://preview.redd.it/qn7vpos4py6e1.jpg?width=2646&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cfd1aa535bdf74cdb57ba8e44f1fa8
13b9d28a7)

A different type of gaming involves authors putting up their poster at unused spots while leaving a sign in 
their formally assigned location that says “See poster at #{better spot}”. If the authors for the unused spot arrived, t
hey’d just move their poster back — but if not, they would presumably revel in the extra attention from being located, f
or example, closer to the hall’s entrance with more foot traffic.

Relocating posters still seems problematic, but at le
ast the posters *belong* at the conference. On the other hand, I feel much more strongly that unauthorized posters for p
ersonal or commercial promotion hurts the integrity of the space, disrespects the presenters whose posters truly belong 
there, and undermines the conference overall.

Questions for the community:

1. Should there be stricter policies or bet
ter enforcement for poster sessions?
2. How do we differentiate between minor gaming (e.g. relocating posters) and outri
ght exploitation (e.g. unauthorized posters)?
3. Is it fair to tolerate some flexibility as long as the intentions are l
ighthearted or still academic? 
4. How do we address these behaviors moving forward? Should there be consequences?

Ilya Sutskever's recent bombshell at NeurIPS – [https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320811/what-ilya-sutskever-sees-op
enai-model-data-training](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320811/what-ilya-sutskever-sees-openai-model-data-traini
ng) that we've reached 'peak data' and the era of pre-training as we know it is ending – has sent ripples through the AI
 world. His vision of a future dominated by 'agentic,' reasoning AI, capable of learning from limited data, sets the sta
ge for a fundamental shift in how we develop and deploy artificial intelligence. This shift, it turns out, might just be
 the perfect storm for the rise of the TPU and Broadcom's latest chip announcement could be the catalyst. [https://www.b
roadcom.com/company/news/product-releases/62691](https://www.broadcom.com/company/news/product-releases/62691)

**Why TP
Us are Poised to Shine in a Post-'Peak Data' World:**

1. **Inference, Inference, Inference:** Sutskever's emphasis on a
 future where AI is smarter, not just bigger, puts the spotlight squarely on **inference**. This is where AI applies its
 learned knowledge to make predictions and decisions in real-world scenarios. And this is precisely where TPUs have a di
stinct advantage.
2. **Enter Broadcom: The 3.5D XDSiP and the TPU Advantage:** Broadcom's new 3.5D chip isn't just anoth
er incremental improvement; it's a potential game-changer, especially for TPUs. Its innovative design, featuring vertica
l die stacking and face-to-face interconnects, directly addresses the key challenges of inference:
   * **Latency Killer
:** By drastically reducing the distance data needs to travel, Broadcom's chip minimizes latency, enabling the rapid-fir
e calculations that TPUs are built for. This is crucial for real-time inference applications.
   * **Power Saver:** The 
3.5D architecture slashes power consumption, a critical factor for deploying TPUs in data centers and edge devices where
 energy efficiency is paramount.
   * **Density Champion:** The compact form factor allows for denser packing of TPUs, p
aving the way for more powerful and efficient inference systems.

The potential rise of TPUs, spurred by the need for mo
re efficient inference and enabled by innovations like Broadcom's, could trigger a paradigm shift, compelling all major 
players in the AI field to develop their own specialized chips and hardware solutions to remain competitive in this rapi
dly evolving landscape. This may be the dawn of the age of custom AI silicon, and potentially the beginning of the TPU e
ra.

Il a notamment affirmé que le pré-entraînement des modèles tel que nous le connaissons va inévitablement prendre fin, co
mparant les données à un 'combustible fossile' limité. Selon lui, nous avons atteint un pic des données disponibles, car
 il n'existe qu'un seul internet.  
  
Pour l'avenir, il prédit que les prochaines générations d'IA seront plus 'agentiq
ues' et capables de raisonner véritablement, contrairement aux systèmes actuels qui se contentent principalement de reco
nnaître des motifs. Ces systèmes deviendront plus imprévisibles à mesure qu'ils développeront leur capacité.  
  
Il a é
galement établi un parallèle intéressant entre l'évolution de l'IA et la biologie évolutive, suggérant que l'IA pourrait
 découvrir de nouvelles approches de mise à l'échelle, tout comme l'évolution a trouvé un nouveau modèle pour le cerveau
 des hominidés.

I'm not a computer science major but do have extensive technical background (I'm in cognitive science with a computer sc

 aim to refine the project so that I can submit it to a journal or a good conference (NeurIPS maybe!) I've also done thi

l in nature. I presented the research at a big psychology conference. I'm also volunteering at a computational psychiatr

That being said, how much are research projects worth when finding full-time jobs, even 
the ones that are published or presented at conferences? I'm graduating next May. I haven't gotten any internships throu

I’m attending NeurIPS for the first time and it’s quite overwhelming seeing the amount of people and so many recruiters.
 I come from a not so well known university, and have come to the conference completely alone, not even my supervisor is
 here.

I didn’t really end up talking to many other attendees or recruiters because (1) it just seemed hard to approach
 others who are in big groups of people and (2) I’m feeling strong imposter syndrome and under-qualified for the jobs re
cruiters offer. I only got a workshop paper accepted that is more application and not as technical as many of the other 
students.

Any advice for how I can make the most of the rest of the conference? On that note, would anyone also want to
 potentially meet up and have a chat? I’m a 3rd year PhD student from the UK, but from Vancouver myself so know lots of 
stuff going on in the area. Cheers!

```
We would like to share and discuss this NeurIPS spotlight paper (disclaimer: I am a co-author).

**Paper**: [https://arx
iv.org/abs/2406.16540](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16540)  
**GitHub**: [https://github.com/trungtrinh44/DAMP](https://gi
thub.com/trungtrinh44/DAMP)  
**DAMP** (Data augmentation via multiplicative perturbations) is a simple yet effective ap
proach to improving neural network robustness through multiplicative weight perturbations. Unlike traditional data augme
ntation methods, DAMP operates directly on model weights during training, enabling improved corruption robustness withou
t compromising clean image performance or increasing computational cost.  
  
**Key Highlights:**

* **Theoretical Found
ation**: DAMP demonstrates that input corruptions can be equivalently represented as multiplicative weight perturbations
, providing a theoretical basis for weight-space data augmentation.
* **Simple Implementation**: The method requires onl
y random Gaussian sampling and pointwise multiplication, maintaining almost the same training cost as standard SGD while
 being fully compatible with data parallelism.
* **Breakthrough in ViT Training**: Successfully trains Vision Transforme
rs from scratch using only basic preprocessing, achieving ResNet50-level performance (23.7% top-1 error) on ImageNet wit
hout complex augmentations.
* **Advanced Integration**: When combined with MixUp and RandAugment, DAMP significantly imp
roves both clean and corruption performance:
   * ViT-S/16: 20.09% clean error (vs 20.25% baseline), 58.30% avg corrupti
on error (vs 60.07% baseline)
   * ViT-B/16: 19.36% clean error (vs 20.41% baseline), 56.76% avg corruption error (vs 58
.83% baseline)

**Why DAMP?** Unlike traditional approaches that rely on complex data augmentation pipelines or computat
ionally expensive ensemble methods, DAMP provides a simple, theoretically-grounded solution to improving model robustnes
s. Its ability to train Vision Transformers from scratch without advanced augmentations and compatibility with existing 
techniques makes it a practical choice for developing robust vision models.  
**Since DAMP has minimal overhead over sta
ndard training, it is particularly effective when applied to large models and datasets.**  
  
We welcome technical disc
ussions, particularly regarding theoretical connections to other robustness methods and potential applications beyond co
mputer vision!

I believe that in the future, drugs will be highly customisable based on the patience’s health history. Based on your ph
ysiology, syndromes, and genetics, you may receive a drug that is well-suited for you and only you. 

How can you do tha
t? First and foremost, you need data, huge amounts of it. We all know how generative and predictive models had advanced 
in the last year. It wasn’t in fact, until the launch of AlphaFold (by Google, whose team was recently awarded with the 
Chemistry Nobel Prize), that AI drug discovery became prominent. This open source model is used for molecular discovery.
 Again, would be nice if a company could:

1. Generate proprietary synthetic, good quality molecular data using models l
ike AlphaFold.
2. Using this data to train models for drug discovery, reducing pipelines costs and times up to 50%.
3. E
ventually, with the possibility of bringing the first AI-aided drug to the market.

First two points have been achieved,
 and the company is Recursion. We may know them because NVIDIA invested 50m in them. Why then are at ATL? I think the an
swer is time. We all know there is no room for patience when it comes to money sometimes. Training and bringing such res
ults may take years.

However, I think another catalyst is coming. On 9. December, they will host a seminar for new read
outs in one of their most well-known drugs in development, CDK7, for advance solid tumours (an inhibitor, which are curr
ently none approved by the FDA).

Now, I am not saying that they will cure cancer - that’s BS. But over the years conver
ging to novel oncological solutions using AI? This is not the only drug they have (other 9 are in development).

They ha
ve more than 60 petabytes of data.
They combined forces with Exscientia recently, forming probably the most important po
werhouse of AI-drug research.
They are extremely active in the research field (see their presence in the upcoming NeuRIP
S conference) or their new open dataset for Quantum Computing (OpenQDC).

I started investing in IONQ in 2021 for a simi
lar impression. Now I am getting the same vibes with this. I feel that a small catalyst will put this to fly, although t
he real potencial will come in the next 5-10 years. If they can bring the first AI drug to the market,  this implodes.


Of course, no financial advice. I’m long 800 shares and loading as much as I possibly can.

Hello, I hope you are doing well!

I am a second year undergraduate student seeking to land a machine lear
ning research intern position next summer. The CV up there is shrunk to be 1-page length and contains only the most mach
ine learning-related stuff I have created in the past year.  
I am curious in what ways could this CV be bettered and de
tails provided, so I can increase my chances. I have already gotten plenty of industry offers, but I would like to maxim
ize my chances for research positions.

I am very much so aware that, after the second year of undergraduate studies, it
 is very hard to land one, but in case it happens, it can kickstart my career a lot.

I am also interested whether I sho
uld add 2 work in progress papers that I am aiming to publish in the following months - one is related to graph neural n
etworks in medicine, while the other is related to graph neural networks and categorical deep learning.

Thank you in ad
vance - every advice is helpful and appreciated!

Dear MS Students,

We have an opportunity for an MS Thesis project at IBM Research-Zurich.  

**Project description:** D
espite the breakthrough made by large language models (LLMs), they struggle with high-level reasoning tasks requiring de
liberate thinking and problem-solving skills. Particularly, the pretrained state-of-the-art Transformer language models 
fail at compositional generalization, multi-step deductive reasoning, and analogical reasoning \[1, 2, 3\]. As a potenti
al alternative, neuro-symbolic AI seeks complementary approaches that beneficially combine deep learning advancements wi
th symbolic computations to endorse their strengths and supplement their weaknesses. Key challenges in neuro-symbolic AI
 involve the potentially exponential time required to perform probabilistic inference and the difficulty in learning new
 symbolic programs. Our latest research results addressed these challenges by performing analogical reasoning over distr
ibuted representations \[4,5\]. In this project, the main objective is to develop methods that reduce the computational 
bottleneck in general neuro-symbolic AI systems, while maintaining learning rules/programs that exhibit out-of-distribut
ion generalization, flexibility, and interpretability. Other inputs or directions are welcomed.

**Requirements:** Stron
g motivation and self-drive. Strong analytical and problem-solving skills. Concrete knowledge in deep learning, or a sol
id background in machine learning. Experience with TensorFlow or PyTorch frameworks. Expertise with LLMs is an advantage
.

**Some administrative information:**  
o Earliest start date: Feb 2025  
o Duration: 6 months  
o Pay: None (prohibit
ed from ETH)

The thesis will be performed at the IBM Research-Zurich in Rüschlikon. If you are interested in this chall
enging position on an exciting new topic, please send your most recent curriculum vitae including a transcript of BS and
 MS grades by email to: Dr. Michael Hersche ([her@zurich.ibm.com](mailto:her@zurich.ibm.com)) and Dr. Abbas Rahimi ([abr

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Accepted NeurIPS 2024 paper claimed to be solving a novel problem as first work, but ignores 5 p ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gxooqv/d_accepted_neurips_2024_paper_claimed_to_be/) , 2024-12-17-0914
```
At NeurIPS 2024 I found a paper that got accepted that positions its main contribution in the form of “Existing algorith
ms for X ignore Y. We adapt algorithm Z for X to account for Y”.

On OpenReview I see that the reviewers in particular p
raised the novelty of the work, and recognised Y as an important aspect that had been ignored in the field of X.

Now th
e interesting bit: co-authors and I published a paper in Springer’s Machine Learning journal in 2023 that also proposes 
an algorithm for X that account for Y. We were also not the first to study the problem setting of X with Y: our paper’s 
related work section discusses 4 papers that have all proposed algorithms for X that account for Y. One is even from Neu
rIPS (2017), and the oldest one dates back to 2012 (an AAAI paper).

The authors of this 2024 NeurIPS paper completely m
issed all this prior literature and believed they were the first, and so did all the reviewers.

This week I e-mailed th
e authors of this NeurIPS 2024 paper and they acknowledged that these works (mine + the 4 others) indeed were all workin
g on the same problem setting, mentioned that they were unaware of all these works, and acknowledged that they can no lo
nger claim novelty of the problem setting.

NeurIPS allows updating the camera ready paper after the conference, and the
 authors promised to use this opportunity to incorporate those related works and modify their contribution statements to
 no longer claim novelty of a first solution of X with Y.

At the one hand, it makes me happy that our work will get cre
dited appropriately.

At the other hand I have my doubts about the ethics of severely modifying contribution statements 
post-review. The authors will no longer claim novelty, but the reviewers in particular praised this novelty, which makes
 me uncertain whether reviewers would have recommended acceptance had they known that this paper will ultimately no long
er be able to claim the novelty that it claimed to have in the reviewed version.

Moreover this makes me wonder about th
e experimental section. Almost surely, reviewers would have demanded comparison to those 5 prior works as baselines. Thi
s paper did not compare against baselines, which will have seemed reasonable to a reviewer who reviewed this work under 
the assumption that the problem setting was completely novel and no prior methods exist that could function as a baselin
e.

Asking the group here about any thoughts on how such cases should get resolved:
- should the paper be retracted?
- s
hould the area chair / program committee be informed? who may or may not take action
- should the paper just get updated
 by authors in the way that was promised, and that is it?
- something else?

I redacted X, Y and Z in order to not publi
cly shame the authors, as they have engaged with my e-mails and I am convinced that there is no foul play and they truly
 were unaware of those works.

MachineLearning -  [ [D] PhD in RL/ML Theory or LLM ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gvx8vx/d_phd_in_rlml_theory_or_llm/) , 2024-12-17-0914
```
Hi guys,

I'm at a crossroads in my academic journey and would appreciate the community's insights. I'm trying to decide
 between pursuing a PhD focused on reinforcement learning/ML theory versus specializing in large language models with mo
re experimental/applied research (these are the only two offers I had).

# Key considerations are the following:

# Rese
arch Impact

* RL/ML Theory: Foundational work that could advance the field's mathematical understanding
* LLMs: Direct 
applications in today's most transformative AI systems

# Job Prospects

* Theory: Academia, research labs, potentially 
more limited industry roles
* LLMs: High industry demand, active research area in both academia and industry

# Long-ter
m Relevance

* Theory: Core principles likely to remain valuable regardless of specific technologies
* LLMs: Currently r
evolutionary but uncertain long-term trajectory

Personal background

* I'm an international student and about to finish
 my master program in US, so I no longer has enough time before making the final decision. I used to research in ml theo
ry, but did not end up with a real top conference publication in theory. I personally doubt if I have enough mathematica
l background to pursue a successful PhD in this area (e.g., at least publish 2 theory papers a year on ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR
/COLT/AISTATS). At the same time, I am personally doubting if theory works indeed advance the ML/AI community, as many p
apers are just proving vacuous bounds or propose some new algorithms that themselves cannot even implement or experiment
ally tested.
* I also used to research in more applied ml, with one aaai paper. My personal concerns is that I'm not fas
t at implementation and coding, the most strategic ability for a successful applied ML researcher. After we entered the 
LLM era, the pacing or applied ML research (especially in LLM and CV) becomes so fast. It's like competitive programming
 in research community (well, also the #GPUs competition).

Hey everyone,

I’ve seen a lot of posts here about careers in ML and landing internships or jobs, and two things come up
 a lot

1. Building a strong research portfolio and publishing at conferences like NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML, which seems 
to focus more on getting research scientist roles.

2. The growing demand for Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) roles, whi
ch are apparently more in demand than research scientist positions.

I’m curious about the difference between these two 
roles and what kind of portfolio would be ideal for landing an MLE position. I know having a master’s degree is often pr
eferred, but is an impressive publication record necessary for MLE roles? Or is it not that big of a deal?

What are you
r thoughts?
