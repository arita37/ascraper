Cohere is hosting a live demo session featuring the winners of the Coral hackathon, showcasing a c
hatbot app called Chat with RAG that connects to health data points, scans nutrition labels, and provides dietary recomm
endations based on user's goals [1]. Cohere now officially supports both JavaScript and TypeScript, with a short video p
rovided to help users get started [2]. In collaboration with Buildwithfern, Cohere is creating an always-up-to-date and 
well-documented TypeScript SDK, currently in beta, that provides access to the Cohere API from JavaScript/TypeScript and
 supports streaming endpoints [3]. Cohere is also highlighting a maker spotlight on BYTE [4]. As the NeurIPS2023 confere
nce concludes, Cohere For AI Vice President Sarah Ooker and Research Scientist Ahmet Üstün will discuss the mission and 
research goals of the C4AI lab [5].







NVIDIA AI Developer introduces FoundationPose, a unified model for 6D object 
pose estimation and tracking for novel objects [6]. This framework supports both model-based and model-free setups and o
utperforms prior work designed specifically for these tasks [7]. The model is applied to each object without any fine-tu
ning, and the result is comparable to the ground truth throughout the video [8]. NVIDIA AI Developer set a new benchmark
 record for the 'model-based pose estimation' task in the BOP challenge, which has implications for fields such as robot
ics and augmented reality [9]. The foundation model is scalable and can be quickly deployed to different objects, highli
ghting the importance of high-precision pose and tracking for robotic manipulation in tasks that require higher precisio
n [10]. Smooth and accurate pose tracking is also important in enabling high-fidelity physics simulation for an improved
 augmented reality (AR) gaming experience [11].







The latest annual McKinsey Global Survey on the state of AI revea
ls that one-third of organizations are using generative AI tools regularly in at least one business function. AI has bec
ome a focus for company leaders, with C-suite executives personally using gen AI tools for work. However, many organizat
ions are not fully prepared for the risks associated with gen AI, with less than half of respondents saying their organi
zations are mitigating the risk of inaccuracy [15].







Auto-Regressive Language Models (AR-LLMs) are useful for conv
erting abstract ideas into sequences of tokens, such as words, actions, or code. However, abstract ideas should be furth
er developed through planning and reasoning in representation space. AR-LLMs bypass the step of reasoning in representat
ion space and directly generate answers from prompts [16][17][18].







The AI industry would be significantly hindere
d if research labs in the industry had not open sourced their code, patented everything, and enforced their patents. The
 open sourcing of code and lack of patent enforcement has been beneficial for the development and progress of the AI ind
ustry [19]. ChatGPT, for instance, is built with PyTorch [20]. The patents on ConvNets expired in 2007 [21][23].








Google AI has introduced StyleDrop, a model that allows for stylized text-to-image synthesis by using style reference im
ages instead of text prompts. This approach enables the generation of images in a style consistent with the reference, b
ypassing the need for text prompt engineering [33]. Google Research has developed Magic Editor, an AI-powered photo edit
or that allows users to easily make complex edits to photos using generative AI [34]. Google AI has also made recent adv
ances in using machine learning (ML) to improve the efficiency of ML workloads, introducing TpuGraphs and developing Gra
ph Segment Training [35].







NVIDIA AI hosted a webinar series on getting started with AI inference, focusing on bui
lding and deploying cloud-ready AI-inferencing solutions for large language models [31]. The paper titled 'Privacy Audit
ing with One (1) Training Run' by Thomas Steinke, Milad Nasr, and Matthew Jagielski has won the Best Paper award at Neur
IPS 2023 [32].

Hello,

I'm trying to understand what sort of background preparation in mathematics is sufficient to conduct publishable
 research in top venues.

Is calculus, linear algebra, engineering level probability & statistics and optimization suffi
cient ?

By **sufficient**, I mean the *bare minimum* you must know to get by and *you learn more things as you encounte
r them* or solve problems (**learning while doing**) without having to first prepare requisite background and then dive 
in.


My **main problem** is - at what point do I say let's directly jump into research and figure out things I don't kn
ow on the fly VS first learn the necessary background and then proceed. I'm familiar - not strong but have taken those c
ourses in undergrad but have largely forgotten many important concepts.

The **traditional** approach in mathematics (as
 suggested by MathOverflow folks) involves nothing short of solving textbook exercises in Math for mastery. This is larg
ely impractical/unfeasible and will take forever stalling me from actual research progress.

A **parallel** question is 
also - *how do you guys learn the math you don't know ? Do you actually solve textbook problems like folks from Math dep
artments ? Or just understand high level picture and key central idea without focusing on proofs or a dozen theorems sur
rounding it ?*

Any help from authors from ML venues is greatly appreciated. 

Please post only if you are an ML researc
her or from academia :).

Thank you very much !

```
Am visiting New Orleans for NeurIPS and stumbled across Papier Plume in the French Quarter. 

The gentleman there was so
 helpful! I originally went in for a Pilot vanishing point with a stub nib that I turned out not to like. I’ve wanted an
 823 with a falcon nib for a while but assumed they weren’t available in the USA. 

A short chat later - he swapped a Nu
mber 15 FA nib off another pen onto this one and I couldn’t be happier! 

Great to have the ergonomics and ink capacity 
of the 823 with this fantastic nib - if you don’t think about it, it’s a free flowing smooth fine nib, but slow down and
 pay attention and touch can get a lot of character with the flex - still very much learning how.

Generative diffusion models are all the rage, but it is unclear how they could be
 applied to sequences of varying numbers of events, e.g. tweets, reddit comments or taxi trips. We present a diffusion a
pproach that turns any sequence into a noise sequence, a sample from a homogeneous Poisson process. Conversely, our mode
l transforms such noise sequence samples iteratively into samples from any target data distribution by deleting events t
hat it classifies as noise and proposing new events from a learned (conditional) intensity distribution. Experimentally,
 we were able to demonstrate excellent forecasting performance on various benchmark datasets.

I am looking forward to d
iscuss our method here on reddit. If you happen to be at NeurIPS, you can also meet /u/davidluedke at poster #602 on Tue

```
Dear fellow NeurIPS rejects. As your deep learning, reinforcement learning, graph neural networks, and deep learning the
ory people fly off to New Orleans and you realize that you are left behind.

&#x200B;

I invite you to join me in this g
roup therapy discussion, where our topic of the day is Collusion Rings.

&#x200B;

I suppose that.... the first question
 is do they actually exist, and what is the extent of their penetration into the machine learning academic community? As
 someone who struggled many years to have their first paper published, it's my anecdotal evidence that machine learning 
is much more about marching to the beat of the drummer, where the drummer is certainly someone who is a fan of deep lear
ning.

&#x200B;

As someone struggling, still, to get another paper published, my anecdotal observation is the drum beat
ing has gotten even more fierce over the last few years.

&#x200B;

As someone who has had many, many conversations with
 others whom are also marginalized, our anecdotal data pools not quite to a dataset, but a filtration which is not i.i.d
., but certainly indicates actively farming deep learning citations is the better choice for our careers.

&#x200B;

As 
someone currently reviewing for ICLR/AAAI/AISTATS. My anecdotal evidence is the reviewer coordination is with secret han
dshakes, keywords, citations, reference lists, topics, arxiv preprints, and shibboleths.

&#x200B;

I hope you find the 
bravery to share your experience as one who is on the inside looking out, or on the outside looking in.

&#x200B;

As a 
beacon of hope, I remind you to read [The Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet](https://medium.com/@mijordan3/artificial-intel
ligence-the-revolution-hasnt-happened-yet-5e1d5812e1e7) by Michael Jordan.

&#x200B;

As a final question to ponder. Is 
the deep learning collusion ring already collapsing, and will it collapse further?

Hey all,

Hope you all are doing good. I am planning to apply for CS Phd program at [Khoury College of Computer Sciences
](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at NEU where I majorly want to focus on 3d vision. I graduated this year (June 2
023) with a 3.69 in BSCS. I am kind of insecure about it ngl. I have one publication and it was in an image processing c
onference (SPIE) in Amsterdam. It is majorly about analyzing and processing remote sensing data. Other than that I have 
2.5 years of research experience during my degree as I worked in 2 different labs for almost 2.5 years. I also have almo
st 1.5 years of industry experience as I was working at a start up as an ML engineer and I am currently working remote i
n 3d vision as AI engineer at startup in Hongkong. I have won 3 hackathons (2 international and 1 national) and I also w
on the 2nd prize for my final year project.

Now i have seen people who are studying at NEU have stellar GPAs like 3.9s 
and 3.8s. The only reason mine fell cause I had to support my degree and that's why I was basically working part-time at
 the start up as an ML engineer. Publishing was my dream and I did in the end but its not in some shiny conference like 
CVPR or Neurips but ya I mean I  am thankful that I do have one. It wasn't easy. So idk if I stand a chance here at NEU 
and so here I am asking you guys to help me through this process. I am obviously planning to apply next year, cause I ha
ve to like save up for apps and IELTS.

```
I am preparing my CV for grad school apps and I have one conference paper and one preprint (already submitted to journal
) to list on it. I am second author on both but had far more involvement in the preprint work so I would like to highlig
ht that. Much of my CV consists of work on this project as well.  
  
I have a separate 'Preprints' and 'Conference Pa
pers' sections. I was thinking I would put 'Preprints' first because this is the project I heavily contributed to, but I
 question this since the conference paper is 'published' in that it was already reviewed and accepted to this conference
 (a Neurips workshop). Which should be put first?

rious roles[7][8][9][29]. The company aims to make video creation accessible to everyone and is looking for passionate a
nd ambitious team members[8].







A new AI system, Sturgeon, has been developed for brain tumor surgeries. It uses ra
pid nanopore sequencing to obtain molecular subclassification of tumors in under 90 minutes. The system can assist in ne
urosurgical decision-making and potentially prevent additional surgeries[42][43].







Artie has launched its Analytic
s Portal, a real-time database replication solution that provides visibility into streaming data pipelines and offers sy
stem infrastructure monitoring[45]. Decoherence has launched Stable Video, a next-generation video generator that allows
 users to create videos with remarkable camera movement and fidelity using just a starting image or text[46]. Solve Inte
lligence, a legal tech startup, has raised $3 million in funding. The company provides an AI-powered in-browser document
 editor for patent attorneys to write high-quality patents efficiently[47].







NVIDIA has announced NeMo Retriever, 
a microservice that allows for the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities into AI applications
. RAG combines information retrieval with large language models (LLMs) to enhance their knowledge and address limitation
s[50][53]. NVIDIA's AI technology, Picasso, has been recognized as one of the Next Big Things in Tech in AI and data by 
Fast Company[49][52].







Google Research has made contributions to Call Screen on Pixel phones, a feature that uses 
on-device ASR to transcribe callers' requests in real-time[55]. The Google Research team in Ghana has been collecting da
ta to train automatic speech recognition models for local languages in Africa[57].







SDXL Turbo is a real-time text
-to-image generation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance by using a new distillation technology. This techn
ology allows for single-step image generation with high quality[58]. Yann LeCun and Catherine Rathkopf wrote an essay di
scussing the misconception that language models like ChatGPT are intelligent simply because they are fluent[61].








Cohere is hosting a demo showcase with Stepan Pushkarev, CEO and CTO of Provectus Inc, at their booth 124 every day at 1
0:30 am and 1:30 pm PT during the AWS re:Invent event[62].

OpenAI's approach to Q-Learning has been drawing significant attention recently.

However, there's a fundamental issue i
n the way Q-learning is typically implemented in deep learning and neural network environments. This concern is highligh
ted in the award-winning paper 'Non-delusional Q-learning,' presented at NeurIPS.

The paper suggests a fundamental flaw
 in the blind application of Q-learning updates to deep neural networks. It points out that such updates can create a se
lf-contradictory scenario where improving the network for the current batch of data inadvertently makes it less effectiv
e for other batches. This is akin to a situation in supervised learning where optimizing a network for a specific set of
 data may degrade its performance on other datasets.

For more insights, the full paper can be accessed here: [Non-delus
ional Q-learning Paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2018/hash/5fd0245f6c9ddbdf3eff0f505975b6a7-Abstract.htm
l)(Follow up ICML paper: [Practical Non-delusional-Q Learning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cebly/Papers/CONQUR_ICML_2020
_camera_ready.pdf) )

I'm curious about others' views on this topic. What do you think about the implications of these f
indings for the future of Q-learning in deep learning environments?

Contention 
exists over the potential for AGI to pose a threat to humanity;[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_

\------------------------------ end update

My issue with this is why is one organization 
defining what AI is? And so drastically at that. Why isn't there a community of AI scientist and engineer's that are agr
eeing on such a pivotal definition for an agreed upon general consensus?

**Original Post:**

Upon researching why peopl
e are so confused by what is meant by the today's (apparently) lightning rod term 'Artificial General Intelligence' or '
AGI' one would have to look to none other than how OpenAI moved the goal post of what AGI is. Wikipedia: [https://en.wik

org/wiki/Futures_studies).

Odd, who is notation 4? Hmm, who could that be that wrote an update to what the definition o
f what AGI means. Oh it's OpenAI themselves.

4. ['OpenAI Charter'](https://openai.com/charter). *openai.com*. Retrieved
 6 April 2023.

I'm not going to go into a diatribe about how the definition is purely related to Effective Altruism and
 not rooted in technical reality. But I will show you that just a few paragraphs down in the same article they describe 
AGI in a much different way.

\>  Terminology

AGI is also known as strong AI,[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art
ificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKurzweil2005260-10)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_gene
ral_intelligence#cite_note-Kurzweil_2005-08-05-11) full AI,[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_int
elligence#cite_note-12) human-level AI[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:2
-5) or general intelligent action.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTN
OTENewellSimon1976-13) However, some academic sources reserve the term 'strong AI' for computer programs that experience
 [sentience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience) or [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness).[\
[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-Searle's_Strong_AI-14) In contrast, weak A
I (or narrow AI) is able to solve one specific problem, but lacks general cognitive abilities.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipe
dia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-15)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_inte
lligence#cite_note-Kurzweil_2005-08-05-11) Some academic sources use 'weak AI' to refer more broadly to any programs tha
t neither experience consciousness nor have a mind in the same sense as humans.[\[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art
ificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-Searle's_Strong_AI-14)

Related concepts include artificial [superintelligence](h
ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence) and transformative AI. An artificial superintelligence (ASI) is a hypoth
etical type of AGI that is much more generally intelligent than humans.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial
_general_intelligence#cite_note-16) And the notion of transformative AI relates to AI having a large impact on society, 
for example similar to the agricultural revolution.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligenc
e#cite_note-17)

It seems as if they wanted to water down and dilute the understanding and meaning of what AGI is for pe
rhaps I don't know contractual obligations?

rth, profit allocated to investors and employees, including Microsoft, is capped. All residual value created above and b
eyond the cap will be returned to the Nonprofit for the benefit of humanity.
* Fifth, the board determines when we've at
tained AGI. Again, by AGI we mean a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work.
 Such a system is excluded from IP licenses and other commercial terms with Microsoft, which only apply to pre-AGI techn
ology.

Interestingly this was reported in many places as much as 6 days ago.

Point is. How do yo
u get to change the goal post and determine all by yourselves what AGI is? Nah this isn't going to fly. Nice try. I feel
 this verbiage is going to get changed very soon.

There are websites like this keeping track of ML conference deadlines like this https://aideadlin.es/?sub=ML,CV,CG,NLP,R
O,SP,DM,AP,KR

Are there any such websites keeping track of ML competitions . Specifically competitions as part of ML co
nferences like Neurips, CVPR and so on.

>Neural MMO 2.0 is a massively multi-agent environment for reinforcement  learning research. The key feature of 
this new version is a flexible  task system that allows users to define a broad range of objectives and  reward signals.
 We challenge researchers to train agents capable of  generalizing to tasks, maps, and opponents never seen during train
ing.  Neural MMO features procedurally generated maps with 128 agents in the  standard setting and support for up to. Ve
rsion 2.0 is a complete  rewrite of its predecessor with three-fold improved performance and  compatibility with CleanRL
. We release the platform as free and  open-source software with comprehensive documentation available at [this http URL
](http://neuralmmo.github.io/)  and an active community Discord. To spark initial research on this new  platform, we are
 concurrently running a competition at NeurIPS 2023.
