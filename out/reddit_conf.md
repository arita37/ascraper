2. GRE: 330
3. Publications:
    3 published (top tier) journal papers in a scientific domain (ML + SCI)
  
  3 AI workshops (1 CVPR + 2 NeurIPS)
    1 ongoing scientific journal submission
    Hopefully 2 submissions for this y

# Best AI Writing Detectors in 2024

AI-generated content is everywhere, and it’s getting harder to tell if a piece of w
riting was created by an AI or a human.

I've rounded up a list of the best AI content detectors to help you figure out 
what’s human-written and what’s likely generated by AI.

# Top AI Detectors for Accuracy in 2024

* [**Originality.AI**](https://tinyurl.com/Originality-AI-Detect-Red
dit): Independent testers cite [98.8% accuracy](https://ddiy.co/originality-ai-review/) for detecting GPT-4 and ChatGPT 
content specifically. Unique features include fact checking in addition to AI detection
* [**Scribbr Premium AI Detector

te](https://www.scribbr.com/ai-tools/best-ai-detector/), the highest among the tools tested. Free and premium tools avai
lable.
* [**Winston AI**:](https://gowinston.ai/) Claims to have [99% accuracy](https://zapier.com/blog/ai-content-detec
tor/) for spotting content from ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Bard, according to their internal tests.
* [**QuillBot AI Detector**
](https://quillbot.com/ai-content-detector): Tied for second place among free tools, scoring [78% accuracy](https://www.
scribbr.com/ai-tools/best-ai-detector/) in independent testing. Features a low false positive rate. Limited free version

g detection. As the use of AI content detection tools becomes more widespread, especially with the best AI content detec
tors like Winston AI and other advanced AI tools, it’s important to think about the impact these technologies have.

One
 major concern is the potential for **misidentifying human-generated content** as AI-generated. When an AI checker mista
kenly flags authentic human writing as generated content, it can unfairly penalize creators. This risk is particularly s
ignificant when using AI content detection tools at scale, where the margin for error could lead to harm for genuine wri
ters who rely on their content for credibility and livelihood.

Another issue is how these tools might be used to **bypa
ss AI detection**. As AI content generation becomes more sophisticated, there’s a growing cat-and-mouse game between tho
se creating AI-generated text and those trying to identify it. This can lead to a situation where the focus shifts more 
towards beating the detection system rather than maintaining the integrity of content.

Additionally, there’s the broade
r impact on **trust and the value of human content**. If AI content detectors are overused or misused, it could create a
 culture of mistrust where all content is viewed with suspicion. This undermines the value of human-generated content an
d could discourage creativity and innovation.

Finally, the rise of AI writing detection tools raises questions about **
privacy and consent**. When content is automatically scanned and analyzed by AI text detectors, there’s a risk that pers
onal or sensitive information could be exposed or misinterpreted. It’s essential to establish clear guidelines on how th
ese tools should be used, ensuring they respect the privacy and rights of content creators.

In 2024 and beyond, as AI c
ontent detectors become more advanced, it’s crucial to consider these ethical issues and develop frameworks that ensure 
these tools are used responsibly, protecting both the integrity of human-generated content and the rights of creators.

This semester I am in a Neural Networks class and I need to do a project. The project is a 1h presentation of a semi-rec
ent NeurIPS/ICLM/COLT paper (or similar) + a 30min presentation of some numerical experiments (computations) of the pape
r.

The thing is that this is a second course on Machine Learning from the same professor and he recommends that it has 
to be related to the presentation we did last semester. In my case it was this: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07809](https
://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07809) which are bounds on the generalization using mutual information. The problem is that this p
aper is too theoretical and is difficult to do numerical experiments.

The professor agreed with me and suggested to do 
something related to **algorithmic stability** and generalization instead. So I'm asking here if any of you have a sugge
stion. That would be much appreciated :)

What is the rule for updating your paper during the rebuttal/discussions phase for a conference?  
Some conferences expl
icitly say that this is not allowed.

[NeurIPS Authors FAQ: ](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2024/PaperInformation/NeurI

***Can we upload a revision of our paper during the rebuttal/discussion period?*** *No revisions are allowed u
ntil the camera-ready stage.*

[ICML Author instruction: ](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorInstructions)

*There 
is no option to upload a revised version of the paper during the author feedback period. Upon the acceptance of the pape
r, it is up to the authors to include any changes to improve the paper (without essentially changing its content, compar
ed to what the reviewers have seen) in the final, camera ready version of the paper.*

However, when looking into papers
 on OpenReview from previous years, in the rebuttal answers many authors say: *We updated and uploaded the revised versi
on of the paper.*.. *As per you suggestion, we made changes on page 2 in the revised version of the paper.*

So is it th
at authors just ignore the official statements from the conferences and decide to upload revisions? Also for the reviewe

Hey everyone,

# Getting into a good ML Job

I want to get into a good research position to gain exposure to ML research
 from top ML research companies in the world to gain exposure and work on smaller specific niche startups to solve some 
problems. Now the problem is that I ONLY have a *CS&E degree in Computer Engineering*, in contrast to a 5-10 year experi
enced PhD principal research engineer-like position in a company that insists on getting a PhD candidate only. These com
panies often insist on hiring PhD graduates because they bring a deep level of expertise and a proven track record in re
search.

# Problems with PhD

When it comes to pursuing a PhD, I’m running into another set of challenges. Top universit
ies around the world typically admit students based on impressive resumes - which include achievements like - (1) awards
 from prestigious conferences, (2) published research papers, and (3) strong letters of recommendation from prominent pr
ofessors and there's a lot of competition too. Unfortunately, my situation is quite different.

My college school was a 
very ordinary one - I don't think we have some of the world's most prominent teachers who can write referrals or strong 
endorsements and I never had any award in my life before in an ML or Academic degree before (at least the prominent ones
) to show them. I haven’t received any major awards in Machine Learning or academia that could make my application stand
 out. This puts me at a disadvantage compared to the top candidates, who often have resumes filled with numerous accolad
es, dozens of published papers in collaboration with renowned researchers, and strong recommendations from leading figur
es in the field. Moreover, I don’t currently have a mentor or an experienced individual to guide me through the process 
of achieving these goals. This lack of mentorship adds to the pressure I’m feeling, as I’m trying to compete against som
e of the best and brightest minds who have had access to far more resources and support.  
To complicate things further,
 I live in a small town, and as the only child of retired parents, I have financial responsibilities to support them. Th
is means I can’t afford to be away for an extended period, such as the 5-6 years it typically takes to complete a PhD in
 the US or Europe. Given my family obligations, pursuing a long-term PhD abroad is not a feasible option for me.

# My c
urrent approach to solving the mess - getting a PhD

I’m in a small town, supporting retired parents, so I can’t commit 
to a long PhD abroad. So I had only two axes out of three where I seem to improve myself - *one is to write some good pa
pers into top journals (like ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, etc) and maintain a good GitHub repo as a good engineer.* 

My GitHub 
is by far average in attendance, but it is somewhat satisfactorily good enough and I trust my skills here - I can write 
implementations from papers and optimize and compile them enough for real-world deployments, and optimizers. I'm good wi
th reading papers and getting them on code quickly. Have a good idea of meta-programming and how big libraries work and 
can easily get along with the codebase or port models across platforms/frameworks.

My current plan is *to improve my pr
ofile by publishing papers in top conferences like ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS, and maintaining a strong GitHub repo*. Now t
he problem is writing papers. I'm all okay with writing a few papers as a lone author. I understand it is very difficult
 to get the first paper into conferences like ICLR, and NeurIPS in a single go, **but** **I'm open to all feedback and l
earnings all along and other adjacent papers from where I can learn things easily.**

# Need Suggestion - Are there rela
ted papers/areas/fields that'd help me?

Currently, I've compute restrictions and have been carrying out with free resou
rces. So, I've some limitations in the areas - more aligned towards theoretical problems than actual practical ones (tha
t require more compute and resources!), although I can work in any area related to language processing or computer visio
n.

I’m limited by compute resources, so I’m focusing on more theoretical areas. **So, I'm open to all the suggestions f
or the areas where I can work with less compute and isn't very hard to start.** I've found a few areas like:

1. Interpr
etability of the transformer-based language models - using probability circuits, and custom languages to interpret their
 hidden mechanism and workings. 
2. Problem-solving using instructions (Tree-of-Thoughts, Chain-of-Thoughts, etc) - thei
r theoretical analysis, study and different variations. 
3. Interpretation or eval aspects of Language models - their em
ergent abilities, locality, etc.

I’m worried about being too theoretical, as big ML orgs lean towards practical work. A
ny advice on how to proceed, or suggestions for areas that are less compute-intensive but still impactful, would be grea
tly appreciated!

# Open to other alternative suggestions too!

Thanks!

all -  [ Yurtdışı - Türkiye ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CodingTR/comments/1evhsx5/yurtdışı_türkiye/) , 2024-09-03-0911
```
Selam herkese,

Üç temel sorum olacak, fikirlerinizi gerçekten merak ediyorum. (TLDR aşağıda)

Bu sene UK'de Data Scienc
e master'ı yapacağım (top 100 bir okul), bilgisayar mühendisliğinden yeni mezun oldum fakat 2 seneye yakın sektörde iş t
ecrübem var. Hali hazırda Türkiye'de bir işim var ve memur maaşı seviyesinde bir maaş alıyorum. Master'dan sonra UK ya d
a Amerika'da 1-2 sene çalışıp hem okul masrafını karşılayıp hem de biraz tecrübe edinip, çok ısınamazsam dönerim temel p
lanımdı. Fakat genel olarak ne daha mantıklı hiç kafamda oturtamadığını farkettim. Yurtdışına 'alışsam' bile FAANG tarzı
 çok büyük firmalarda çalışmadıktan sonra Türkiye'den remote çalışmanın (2.5-3.5k$ net aylık) yurtdışında nereden baksam
 (4-6k$ net aylık) orta-üst arası net bir maaşa eşit olduğunu düşünüyorum (olay sadece para değil biliyorum iş/yaşam koş
ulları olarak da konuşabiliriz). Açıkçası bunun üstünde maaşlar da hele şuan sektördeki rekabeti ve piyasayı düşününce g
özüme zor geliyor. Günün sonunda aynı parayı biriktirebileceksem de yurtdışında birkaç sene durup alışmadıysam dönmek da
ha mantıklı geliyor. Ama sizce maaşlar 'gerçek anlamda' daha fazla olur mu yurtdışında ya da TR'den remote iş kovalamak 
da bir o kadar imkansız mı? UK'de net olarak ayda 7-8k$ alabileceğim senior pozisyonlar var ama (çok rekabetçi) öte yand
an bir dairenin kirası neredeyse 2.5k$ Londra'da. Amerika'da da gidip Seattle, SF falan yaşadığımda da aynı şeyler olaca
k. Yani bana şöyle geliyor: ultra yüksek maaş skalası ve pahalı yer, yüksek maaş ama pahalı yer, ortalama maaş ve ortala
ma masraf, yurtdışında seçeneklerim bunlarmış gibi. Ve FAANG hariç diğer seçenekler mantıksızmış gibi hissediyorum. FAAN
G tarzı bir yer için de biraz kafayı kırıp çok ekstra çalışmak lazım sanırım. Üniversitenin başından beri kendimi gelişt
irmeye çalışıyorum, 3. sınıfta işe girdim, mezun olmadan tam zamanlı çalışmaya başladım. Benden çok çok iyi pozisyon ve 
maaşlarda başlayan arkadaşlarım da var benden kötü olanları da var ama günün sonunda ben elimdekinden çok memnun değilim
 hep sıkı çalıştım, dereceyle iyi bir üniversiteden mezun oldum fakat günün sonunda elimde olan sadece bir 'memur maaşı'
. Master'dan sonra belki Türkiye'de hayalimdeki maaşları yine alamayacağım, yurtdışında da aynı şekilde (sektör malum). 
Master'da NeurIPS tarzı yerlerde paper kovalayıp ya da sağlam projeler yapıp son bir sağlam koşu yapmam gerekiyor gibi h
issediyorum bu konuda ne düşünüyorsunuz? Ve siz genel olarak sektördeki rekabete karşı ne yapıyorsunuz?

  
TLDR:

1) Si
zce Türkiye ile Yurtdışında yazılımcı olarak çalışmak için (default olarak Türkiye'de yaşamanın size daha tercih edilebi
lir geldiğini varsayalım) ne tür farklar olmalı maaş ve iş koşulları açısından?

2) Üniversiteden/Yazılım'a ilk atıldığı
 süreden beri çok sıkı çalışıp istediğini alamadığını düşünen ya da çok çalışıp istediğini aldığını düşünen arkadaşlar s
ektördeki rekabet ve bir sonraki kariyer adımlarınız hakkında ne düşünüyorsunuz?

3) Sizce biraz çalışmaktan yorulmuş ol
mama rağmen kendimi motive edip NeurIPS tarzı yerlerde makale yayınlatabilmek için sıkı çalışmalı mıyım? Bu tarz makalel
er büyük şirketlerde Research Engineer olarak işe girmekte çok büyük + sağlıyor.

```
The NeurIPS rebuttal period is finally over. How is everyone’s review? 

I had the worst experience ever with one review
er. For the initial comments, he/she only wrote a short paragraph asking a bunch of questions that can be easily answere
d by the content of the paper, then put a score of 3 and a confidence of 4. For the rebuttal, this reviewer gave contrad
ictory statements, and can’t even understand the difference between training data and testing data. I spent two good day
s explaining the difference. Finally, the reviewer left an incorrect statement about the paper and disappeared. Typical 
reviewer 2.

```
There's been a lot of talk about genAI, but most of it has been hand wavy. Imo, there's only a few things GenAI is usefu
l for. Communications, making decisions (reading PDFs, emails, etc and triggering actions), and insights (+ transforming
 large amounts of data into human readable text).

I'm trying to build something of value with Endflow which aims to be 
the AI hub for material procurement insights and actions. What it does:

1. Automation: Removes a lot of manual parts of
 the end-to-end purchase order process. Such as automated follow up schedules for open POs, matching invoice to PO to pa
cking slip, grief rack RCA, creating evidence-backed AI vendor scorecards, etc.
2. Insights: When you should consider re
placing a vendor, POs we deem as at risk, parts consolidation and volume discounts, other supply chain risks, etc.
3. Da
ta: Keeps your ERP/Excel clean and up to date which keeps the demand forecast accurate.

I previously ran a manufacturin
g services business as well being on the founding AI team of a couple startups (including at AutoGPT) and publishing AI 
research at the largest US AI conference (NeurIPS). I'm now trying to combine the two into a product that adds genuine v
alue.

Curious to get get your thoughts/feedback! Please lmk if you have questions & call me out if you have concerns :)

2. Insights: From this data we can notify you wh

```
Although I have papers in some top venues (IJCAI, ACL, etc.), I tend to receive poor reviews initially, leading to a cyc
le of resubmissions before finally getting accepted. While some reviews at top conferences can be really poor, I can't b
lame everything on the reviewers. Since receiving the NeurIPS reviews this year, I've been reflecting on what I can impr
ove in my approach to avoid these frustrating cycles of resubmission.

My reviewers often mention that my papers read we
ll and are easy to follow, but they aren't impressed by the novelty. I understand that since I don't work with LLMs or o
ther trendy topics, reviewers usually don't seem to grasp the importance of the task I'm working on or the method itself
.

In improving my approach, I want to start with the figures. I usually use [draw.io](http://draw.io), but this often r
esults in unimpressive figures, reminiscent of those seen in papers from the 2000s. What tools are you all using to crea
te more polished figures? I understand that a tool is just a medium for expression and shouldn't limit what I want to ac
hieve, but I still want to know how you make good figures that encapsulate your work concisely and give reviewers a bett
er understanding of what you're doing.
