Dataset and benchmarks track reviews are supposed to come out today after the delay.

I am sure we are a lot less concer
ned by this compared to the main track but this can serve as a discussion thread :)

So I am looking for a company to do my Master research project at. I was looking at Sony but of course they have extreme
ly high standards. I saw that they wanted you to have papers published in the large conferences like NeurIPS. 

But do a
ny master students even publish papers on that level? I know of 1 paper in my uni that got published and the person work
s for microsoft now. But I feel like as a Master student that is very rare. Thoughts?

  
The description said MS/PhD so
 ofc that is where the 'papers published' came from, but I am still curious.

Is Unlimited Context Length really possible?  At what cost?

Amanda Bertsch, author of 2023 NeurIPS paper Unlimiformer, 
 will describe the architecture and take questions at this Friday's [Oxen.ai](http://Oxen.ai) Paper Club.

Greg Schoenin
ger u/FallMindless3563, Oxen CEO and Master of Plain Speak, will help interp the concept and relate it to other papers w
e have reviewed.

Call:  [https://oxen.ai/community](https://oxen.ai/community)

NeurIPS 2024 paper reviews are supposed to be released today. I thought to create a discussion thread for us to discuss 
any issue/complain/celebration or anything else.

There is so much noise in the reviews every year. Some good work that 
the authors are proud of might get a low score because of the noisy system, given that NeurIPS is growing so large these
 years. We should keep in mind that the work is still valuable no matter what the score is.

Does anyone know when the reviews will be released? The NeurIPS website states that the rebuttal starts on July 30th any
where on Earth, and it’s already July 30th in our time zone!

```
Hello!

For those who would be interested in taking part in weather forecasting challenge I would like to let you know a
bout the [~Weather4cast 2024~ ](https://weather4cast.net/)[~Challenge~ ](https://weather4cast.net/)that we are organisin
g at the NeurIPS 2024 Competition Track.

The competition focuses on topics of high impact and practical value for our s
ociety – predicting future weather and changes of our environment. We provide satellite and radar data covering most of 
the Europe and we ask the participants to develop models that could predict extreme precipitation events.

This year, on
 the road to foundation models, **we move from basic rainfall prediction to testing generalisation performance and emerg
ent capabilities of probabilistic models** on a set of downstream tasks, such as cumulative rainfall and the prediction 
of rare extreme weather events. We provide an order of magnitude more hi-resolution data for training on multiple scales
.

To solve the competition task you will need to apply spatio-temporal modelling to complex dynamic systems and demonst
rate the  temporal and spatial transfer learning of your models under strong distributional shifts! Finally, you will ad
dress a super-resolution challenge where you need to predict future hi-res rain radar of ground-based weather stations f
rom broader satellite sensor images!

The sentences quoted in the post title are from *Reuters* article [Exclusive: OpenAI working on new reasoning technology
 under code name ‘Strawberry’](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-working-new-reasoning-t
echnology-under-code-name-strawberry-2024-07-12/), which was originally published on July 12, 2024, and last updated abo
ut 4 hours ago as of this writing. This article was previously covered in this sub [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenA

aforementioned sentences: [link 1](https://archive.ph/cnCrI) and [link 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20240713080951/htt
ps://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-working-new-reasoning-technology-under-code-name-strawber
ry-2024-07-12/).

I'm not sure if the quote refers to the [MATH dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/math), which
 was introduced in [this paper (PDF file)](https://datasets-benchmarks-proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2021/fil
e/be83ab3ecd0db773eb2dc1b0a17836a1-Paper-round2.pdf), the first version of which was [published](https://arxiv.org/abs/2
103.03874) in March 2021. The highest-scoring language model on the MATH benchmark in [OpenAI's tests in the GPT-4o anno
uncement post](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/) is GPT-4o's 76.6. A quote from the aforementioned paper (my boldi
ng):

>**We also evaluated humans on MATH**, and found that a computer science PhD student who does not especially like 
mathematics attained approximately 40% on MATH, **while a three-time IMO gold medalist attained 90%**, indicating that M
ATH can be challenging for humans as well.

EDIT: Another quote from the MATH-related paper:

>Human-Level Performance. 
To provide a rough but informative comparison to human-level performance, we randomly sampled 20 problems from the MATH 
test set and gave them to humans. We artificially require that the participants have 1 hour to work on the problems and 
must perform calculations by hand. All participants are university students. One participant who does not like mathemati
cs got 8/20 = 40% correct. A participant ambivalent toward mathematics got 13/20. Two participants who like mathematics 
got 14/20 and 15/20. A participant who got a perfect score on the AMC 10 exam and attended USAMO several times got 18/20
. A three-time IMO gold medalist got 18/20 = 90%, though missed questions were exclusively due to small errors of arithm
etic.
