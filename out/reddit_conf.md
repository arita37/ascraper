```
Hey. It is the time of the year where everyone's excited for our upcoming session. Welcome to UCSD and I hope you are do
ing great. As a senior, I have been exposed to various handy tools to navigate college life. Here are my recommendations


1. **Networking system**- **Discord, Slack, Instagram webpage** for the **clubs and classes** you are interested in. *
*Piazza** good for reference to asking questions to the instructional team+class. **Cold email and Office hours** have w
orked well in finding research jobs. **Linkedin** is great for having your online profile up top, highly recommend a pro
fessional photograph. **X/Twitter** for following your latest research if you're into EE/AI/related fields. **Geisel, Cl
asses, Intramural Sports and Greek Rush** are experiences that got me some good exposure to social aspects of campus (no
t in a frat but made friends). For jobs **Handshake and Linkedin** is enough if you have a good portfolio going on. Look
 at accepted alumnis portfolio based on your goals and see what jobs fit your traits best. **Resident life events** too 
are lit. Become a IA/SI leader. You'll have fun lol.
2. **Offerup and Facebook Marketplace** are great for furniture and
 rentals. If you're a business nerd like me, you could also practice your negotiation skills there without anything at s
take (LOL!). Other good things I found were **Styl App** and **Poshmark + thrift stores and stockx** if you're looking t
o up your fashion game.
3. **Notetaking**/**Information management-** A HIGHLY debated topic amongst students because pe
n and paper models are outdated. I used **Apple Notes** combined with P**erplexity/Claude/GPT-4** for notetaking. The wo
rkflow I follow is **lecture notes (typed or handwritten + screenshot)-> pdf textbook into perplexity/GPT and prompt to 
follow textbook-> get key concepts and insights per lesson-> work on problems and use LLMs to see how and where each min
i concept applies-> understand doubtful concepts in office hours and mail TAs/post on piazza-> reflect and add summary t
o notes-> hold group study sessions to debate tougher questions and teach what you mastered to other students.**

The wh
ole process takes about 1 hour a day to 2 max per subject- benchmark-> math 142a. Perplexity is useful for getting searc
h and images/videos directly from your notes and interacting with content on a deeper level, GPT is great for summary an
d analysis. I strongly believe we should interface LLMs with learning and conventional instruction. Never rely on LLMs f
or answers. Never cheat. libgen, **JSTOR, arXiv, nature science journal, neurIPS, internet archive** are some excellent 
sources for articles. Geisel has some articles too that can be access with campus **VPNs.** My GPA went from a 3.2 to 4.
0 with straight As thanks to this note taking system. It is like my second brain. I also met a few cool people this way,
 we learnt a lot together.

4. **Hangouts**- The most subjective thing by far. Not a local. I intern full time rn so I b
arely have time. The one activity i did choose was fitness and beaches because I can't keep up with studies otherwise. I
 go to 24 fitness or main gym. Ice rink close by or the mt soledad drive is a cool date idea for reference. Cool tidepoo
ls nearby at LJ shores you can search instagram reels idk i randomly stumbled. There's some good cafes all around town g
o on yelp. Surf spots are windansea and couple others. Convoy easily on top for asian food. Crazy bakeries and sweet sho
ps all around little italy. Hillcrest welfare wednesdays you can do cool stuff. Indian food is good mira mesa side. Mexi
can at Old town and near TJ. SDSU side has lit parties if you want go make friends there and get invited. PB amazing for
 food and party. Downtown has great museums. Seaworld and zoo, sd science center amazing. La Jolla Playhouse is cool. Ch
e cafe is awesome. Gaslamp gastropubs go hard. SD padres games great hangouts you will make lots of friends. MMA PPV eve
nts too. Weekend getaway for non locals they have a secret place at OB which I know lot of you will try goofy stuff. Rem
ember if it takes a toll on your body and affects mental health then it is not worth it.

Ah thank god for speech to tex
t. Have fun. Went through 4 years and a lot of memories.

Hey, everyone.  
Sorry for asking a noob question.  
So basically we have submitted a paper at a workshop of NeurIPS 202
4. This is our first work during our undergrad. After submission, we received an email the next day regarding a margin i
ssue that needed to be fixed, or our submission would be rejected. Which we fixed \[a very unintentional error\] and try
ing to submit it since then  but in the Openreview, it keeps saying that the invitation submission has expired. So is th
ere any deadline we have to maintain for this kind of scenario. The main review will be given in the next month. We have
 tried to contact them, but we are not getting any response.

```
Hi everyone, 

The point of this post is not to blame the authors, I'm just very surprised by the review process.

I jus
t stumbled upon this paper. While I find the ideas somewhat interesting, I found the overall results and justifications 
to be very weak.   
It was a clear reject from ICLR2022, mainly for a lack of any theoretical justifications. [https://o
penreview.net/forum?id=slHNW9yRie0](https://openreview.net/forum?id=slHNW9yRie0)  
The exact same paper is resubmitted a
t NeurIPS2023 and I kid you not, the thing is accepted for a poster. [https://openreview.net/forum?id=XH3ArccntI](https:
//openreview.net/forum?id=XH3ArccntI)

I don't really get how it could have made it through the review process of NeurIP
S. The whole thing is very preliminary and is basically just consisting of experiments.  
It even llack citations of oth
er very closely related work such as *Generative Modelling With Inverse Heat Dissipation* [https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13
397](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13397) which is basically their 'blurring diffusion' but with theoretical background and
 better results (which was accepted to ICLR2023)...

I thought NeurIPS was on the same level as ICLR, but now it seems t
o me sometimes papers just get randomly accepted.

So I was wondering, if anyone had an opinion on this, or if you have 
encountered other similar cases ?

```
I've been studying a \[paper\]\[1\] (Smoothness, Low-Noise and Fast Rates) on the impact of smoothness on the convergenc
e rate of online-to-batch conversion, specifically Theorem 2, which provides a bound on the average regret in the contex
t of online convex optimization. The paper claims that this theorem can be proved using Lemma 3.1 in the original paper 
and Theorem 1 from \[this thesis\]\[2\] (Online Learning: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications). However, I'm struggling
 to see the connection between these results. Could someone help clarify how Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 1 from the thesis are
 used to prove Theorem 2 in the paper?

\*\*Lemma 3.1:\*\* For an $H$-smooth non-negative function $f : W \\rightarrow \
\mathbb{R}$, for all $w \\in W$:

$$

\\|\\nabla f(w)\\|\^\* \\leq \\sqrt{4H f(w)}

$$

\*\*Theorem 1:\*\* Under the sam
e conditions as Lemma 1. Assume that a constant $L$ exists such that for all $t$, the function $f\_t$ is $L$-self-bounde
d for the norm $\\|\\cdot\\|$. Let $U\_1$ and $U\_2$ be two positive scalars and set $c = L + \\sqrt{L\^2 + \\frac{LU\_2
}{U\_1}}$. Then, for any $u \\in S$ that satisfies $f(u) \\leq U\_1$ and $\\sum\_{t=1}\^{T} g\_t(u) \\leq U\_2$, we have
,

$$

R(u, T) = \\sum\_{t=1}\^{T} g\_t(w\_t) - \\sum\_{t=1}\^{T} g\_t(u) \\leq 2\\sqrt{LU\_1U\_2} + 4LU\_1.

$$

\*\*Th
eorem 2:\*\* For any $B \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\overline{L\^\*}$, if we use stepsize

$$

\\eta = \\frac{1}{H B\^2 + \\
sqrt{H\^2 B\^4 + H B\^2 n \\overline{L\^\*}}}

$$

for the Mirror Descent algorithm, then for any instance sequence

$z\
_1, \\ldots, z\_n \\in \\mathcal{Z}$, the average regret w.r.t. any

$w\^\* \\in W$ such that $F(w\^\*) \\leq B\^2$ and 
$\\frac{1}{n} \\sum\_{j=1}\^{n} \\ell(w\^\*, z\_j) \\leq \\overline{L\^\*}$

is bounded by:

$$

\\frac{1}{n} \\sum\_{i=
1}\^{n} \\ell(w\_i, z\_i) - \\frac{1}{n} \\sum\_{i=1}\^{n} \\ell(w\^\*, z\_i) \\leq \\frac{4H B\^2}{n} + \\frac{2 \\sqrt
{H B\^2 \\overline{L\^\*}}}{n}

$$

I found the proof of Theorem 1 a bit confusing as well, particularly because it does
n't clearly explain the relationship between $U\_1, U\_2$, and $c$ in that specific manner.

# Best AI Writing Detectors in 2024

AI-generated content is everywhere, and it’s getting harder to tell if a piece of w
riting was created by an AI or a human.

I've rounded up a list of the best AI content detectors to help you figure out 
what’s human-written and what’s likely generated by AI.

# Top AI Detectors for Accuracy in 2024

* [**TraceGPT**](https
://chatgpt.com/g/g-KI6H8Bz4n-tracegpt-ai-detector): A ChatGTP bot that's described as '[basically perfect](https://zapie
r.com/blog/ai-content-detector/)' in accuracy but independent tests, using AI-generated content from various sources, in
cluding ChatGPT and Claude. Best of all, it's free!
* [**Originality.AI**](https://tinyurl.com/Originality-AI-Detect-Red
dit): Independent testers cite [98.8% accuracy](https://ddiy.co/originality-ai-review/) for detecting GPT-4 and ChatGPT 
content specifically. Unique features include fact checking in addition to AI detection
* [**Scribbr Premium AI Detector
**](https://www.scribbr.com/ai-tools/best-ai-detector/): Came out on top in independent testing with an [84% accuracy ra
te](https://www.scribbr.com/ai-tools/best-ai-detector/), the highest among the tools tested. Free and premium tools avai
lable.
* [**Winston AI**:](https://gowinston.ai/) Claims to have [99% accuracy](https://zapier.com/blog/ai-content-detec
tor/) for spotting content from ChatGPT, GPT-4, and Bard, according to their internal tests.
* [**QuillBot AI Detector**
](https://quillbot.com/ai-content-detector): Tied for second place among free tools, scoring [78% accuracy](https://www.
scribbr.com/ai-tools/best-ai-detector/) in independent testing. Features a low false positive rate. Limited free version
 available.
* [**Sapling**](https://sapling.ai/ai-content-detector): Achieved [68% accuracy](https://www.forbes.com/site
s/technology/article/best-ai-content-detector-tools/) in independent testing, decent but could be better. Limited free v
ersion available.
* [**CopyLeaks**](https://copyleaks.com/): Also scored 66% accuracy in independent testing. Unique fea
tures include detailed reports on content authenticity. 
* [**ZeroGPT**](https://www.zerogpt.com/): Rounded out the list
 with a [64% accuracy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/article/best-ai-content-detector-tools/) rate in independ
ent testing, the lowest among these tools.

Now, keep in mind, no AI detector is foolproof. Even the best ones can miss 
the mark sometimes, throwing out a false positive or negative.

Plus, their accuracy can shift depending on which AI mod
el generated the text and how that text might have been tweaked afterward.

```
This semester I am in a Neural Networks class and I need to do a project. The project is a 1h presentation of a semi-rec
ent NeurIPS/ICLM/COLT paper (or similar) + a 30min presentation of some numerical experiments (computations) of the pape
r.

The thing is that this is a second course on Machine Learning from the same professor and he recommends that it has 
to be related to the presentation we did last semester. In my case it was this: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07809](https
://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07809) which are bounds on the generalization using mutual information. The problem is that this p
aper is too theoretical and is difficult to do numerical experiments.

The professor agreed with me and suggested to do 
something related to **algorithmic stability** and generalization instead. So I'm asking here if any of you have a sugge
stion. That would be much appreciated :)

```
What is the rule for updating your paper during the rebuttal/discussions phase for a conference?  
Some conferences expl
icitly say that this is not allowed.

[NeurIPS Authors FAQ: ](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2024/PaperInformation/NeurI
PS-FAQ)  
***Can we upload a revision of our paper during the rebuttal/discussion period?*** *No revisions are allowed u
ntil the camera-ready stage.*

[ICML Author instruction: ](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorInstructions)

*There 
is no option to upload a revised version of the paper during the author feedback period. Upon the acceptance of the pape
r, it is up to the authors to include any changes to improve the paper (without essentially changing its content, compar
ed to what the reviewers have seen) in the final, camera ready version of the paper.*

However, when looking into papers
 on OpenReview from previous years, in the rebuttal answers many authors say: *We updated and uploaded the revised versi
on of the paper.*.. *As per you suggestion, we made changes on page 2 in the revised version of the paper.*

So is it th
at authors just ignore the official statements from the conferences and decide to upload revisions? Also for the reviewe
rs: is it better if the author makes the changes and uploads new version of the paper during the rebuttal phase?

I'm looking to follow 
up on this. I would like to be able to drag my tasks (from a drop down view) into a slot in the calendar.

  
Maybe this
 can be done by creating a View which is List + Calendar. If this is the case, we should be able to drag tasks into the 
Calendar, and schedule it.

  
And we can have this work for mobile also. Amazing Marvin has a view like the below, wher

Hey everyone,

# Getting into a good ML Job

I want to get into a good research position to gain exposure to ML research
 from top ML research companies in the world to gain exposure and work on smaller specific niche startups to solve some 
problems. Now the problem is that I ONLY have a *CS&E degree in Computer Engineering*, in contrast to a 5-10 year experi
enced PhD principal research engineer-like position in a company that insists on getting a PhD candidate only. These com
panies often insist on hiring PhD graduates because they bring a deep level of expertise and a proven track record in re
search.

# Problems with PhD

When it comes to pursuing a PhD, I’m running into another set of challenges. Top universit
ies around the world typically admit students based on impressive resumes - which include achievements like - (1) awards
 from prestigious conferences, (2) published research papers, and (3) strong letters of recommendation from prominent pr
ofessors and there's a lot of competition too. Unfortunately, my situation is quite different.

My college school was a 
very ordinary one - I don't think we have some of the world's most prominent teachers who can write referrals or strong 
endorsements and I never had any award in my life before in an ML or Academic degree before (at least the prominent ones
) to show them. I haven’t received any major awards in Machine Learning or academia that could make my application stand
 out. This puts me at a disadvantage compared to the top candidates, who often have resumes filled with numerous accolad
es, dozens of published papers in collaboration with renowned researchers, and strong recommendations from leading figur
es in the field. Moreover, I don’t currently have a mentor or an experienced individual to guide me through the process 
of achieving these goals. This lack of mentorship adds to the pressure I’m feeling, as I’m trying to compete against som
e of the best and brightest minds who have had access to far more resources and support.  
To complicate things further,
 I live in a small town, and as the only child of retired parents, I have financial responsibilities to support them. Th
is means I can’t afford to be away for an extended period, such as the 5-6 years it typically takes to complete a PhD in
 the US or Europe. Given my family obligations, pursuing a long-term PhD abroad is not a feasible option for me.

# My c
urrent approach to solving the mess - getting a PhD

I’m in a small town, supporting retired parents, so I can’t commit 
to a long PhD abroad. So I had only two axes out of three where I seem to improve myself - *one is to write some good pa
pers into top journals (like ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, etc) and maintain a good GitHub repo as a good engineer.* 

My GitHub 
is by far average in attendance, but it is somewhat satisfactorily good enough and I trust my skills here - I can write 
implementations from papers and optimize and compile them enough for real-world deployments, and optimizers. I'm good wi
th reading papers and getting them on code quickly. Have a good idea of meta-programming and how big libraries work and 
can easily get along with the codebase or port models across platforms/frameworks.

My current plan is *to improve my pr
ofile by publishing papers in top conferences like ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS, and maintaining a strong GitHub repo*. Now t
he problem is writing papers. I'm all okay with writing a few papers as a lone author. I understand it is very difficult
 to get the first paper into conferences like ICLR, and NeurIPS in a single go, **but** **I'm open to all feedback and l
earnings all along and other adjacent papers from where I can learn things easily.**

# Need Suggestion - Are there rela
ted papers/areas/fields that'd help me?

Currently, I've compute restrictions and have been carrying out with free resou
rces. So, I've some limitations in the areas - more aligned towards theoretical problems than actual practical ones (tha
t require more compute and resources!), although I can work in any area related to language processing or computer visio
n.

I’m limited by compute resources, so I’m focusing on more theoretical areas. **So, I'm open to all the suggestions f
or the areas where I can work with less compute and isn't very hard to start.** I've found a few areas like:

1. Interpr
etability of the transformer-based language models - using probability circuits, and custom languages to interpret their
 hidden mechanism and workings. 
2. Problem-solving using instructions (Tree-of-Thoughts, Chain-of-Thoughts, etc) - thei
r theoretical analysis, study and different variations. 
3. Interpretation or eval aspects of Language models - their em
ergent abilities, locality, etc.

I’m worried about being too theoretical, as big ML orgs lean towards practical work. A
ny advice on how to proceed, or suggestions for areas that are less compute-intensive but still impactful, would be grea
tly appreciated!

# Open to other alternative suggestions too!

Thanks!

```
Selam herkese,

Üç temel sorum olacak, fikirlerinizi gerçekten merak ediyorum. (TLDR aşağıda)

Bu sene UK'de Data Scienc
e master'ı yapacağım (top 100 bir okul), bilgisayar mühendisliğinden yeni mezun oldum fakat 2 seneye yakın sektörde iş t
ecrübem var. Hali hazırda Türkiye'de bir işim var ve memur maaşı seviyesinde bir maaş alıyorum. Master'dan sonra UK ya d
a Amerika'da 1-2 sene çalışıp hem okul masrafını karşılayıp hem de biraz tecrübe edinip, çok ısınamazsam dönerim temel p
lanımdı. Fakat genel olarak ne daha mantıklı hiç kafamda oturtamadığını farkettim. Yurtdışına 'alışsam' bile FAANG tarzı
 çok büyük firmalarda çalışmadıktan sonra Türkiye'den remote çalışmanın (2.5-3.5k$ net aylık) yurtdışında nereden baksam
 (4-6k$ net aylık) orta-üst arası net bir maaşa eşit olduğunu düşünüyorum (olay sadece para değil biliyorum iş/yaşam koş
ulları olarak da konuşabiliriz). Açıkçası bunun üstünde maaşlar da hele şuan sektördeki rekabeti ve piyasayı düşününce g
özüme zor geliyor. Günün sonunda aynı parayı biriktirebileceksem de yurtdışında birkaç sene durup alışmadıysam dönmek da
ha mantıklı geliyor. Ama sizce maaşlar 'gerçek anlamda' daha fazla olur mu yurtdışında ya da TR'den remote iş kovalamak 
da bir o kadar imkansız mı? UK'de net olarak ayda 7-8k$ alabileceğim senior pozisyonlar var ama (çok rekabetçi) öte yand
an bir dairenin kirası neredeyse 2.5k$ Londra'da. Amerika'da da gidip Seattle, SF falan yaşadığımda da aynı şeyler olaca
k. Yani bana şöyle geliyor: ultra yüksek maaş skalası ve pahalı yer, yüksek maaş ama pahalı yer, ortalama maaş ve ortala
ma masraf, yurtdışında seçeneklerim bunlarmış gibi. Ve FAANG hariç diğer seçenekler mantıksızmış gibi hissediyorum. FAAN
G tarzı bir yer için de biraz kafayı kırıp çok ekstra çalışmak lazım sanırım. Üniversitenin başından beri kendimi gelişt
irmeye çalışıyorum, 3. sınıfta işe girdim, mezun olmadan tam zamanlı çalışmaya başladım. Benden çok çok iyi pozisyon ve 
maaşlarda başlayan arkadaşlarım da var benden kötü olanları da var ama günün sonunda ben elimdekinden çok memnun değilim
 hep sıkı çalıştım, dereceyle iyi bir üniversiteden mezun oldum fakat günün sonunda elimde olan sadece bir 'memur maaşı'
. Master'dan sonra belki Türkiye'de hayalimdeki maaşları yine alamayacağım, yurtdışında da aynı şekilde (sektör malum). 
Master'da NeurIPS tarzı yerlerde paper kovalayıp ya da sağlam projeler yapıp son bir sağlam koşu yapmam gerekiyor gibi h
issediyorum bu konuda ne düşünüyorsunuz? Ve siz genel olarak sektördeki rekabete karşı ne yapıyorsunuz?

  
TLDR:

1) Si
zce Türkiye ile Yurtdışında yazılımcı olarak çalışmak için (default olarak Türkiye'de yaşamanın size daha tercih edilebi
lir geldiğini varsayalım) ne tür farklar olmalı maaş ve iş koşulları açısından?

2) Üniversiteden/Yazılım'a ilk atıldığı
 süreden beri çok sıkı çalışıp istediğini alamadığını düşünen ya da çok çalışıp istediğini aldığını düşünen arkadaşlar s
ektördeki rekabet ve bir sonraki kariyer adımlarınız hakkında ne düşünüyorsunuz?

3) Sizce biraz çalışmaktan yorulmuş ol
mama rağmen kendimi motive edip NeurIPS tarzı yerlerde makale yayınlatabilmek için sıkı çalışmalı mıyım? Bu tarz makalel
er büyük şirketlerde Research Engineer olarak işe girmekte çok büyük + sağlıyor.
