Hi everyone, I'm currently pursuing an MSc in AI, and while the coursework is enjoyable, I find the assignments somewhat
 simplistic and doubt their ability to impress potential employers. Therefore, I've decided to undertake my own project,
 but I've hit a roadblock in generating ideas (I'll admit, creativity isn't my strongest suit).

I've been considering v
arious avenues, such as conducting experiments on llama-2-7b, exploring its potential for tunning, or even building an A
PI. However, I'm hesitant and seeking input from the community.

Just to provide some background, I'm proficient in Pyth
on with a good knowledge of PyTorch, HuggingFace, Langchain, and other default ML frameworks(np, pd, etc.) as well as Az
ure. However, I must mention that my hardware setup is relatively modest, and I may need to rent a GPU for projects requ
iring significant computational power.

I'm open to suggestions and would greatly appreciate any ideas or guidance you m
ay have to offer. Thank you in advance!

```
Hello! I have a question I haven’t been able to find online, and was hoping someone could explain it to me. 

I need to 
build a “chatbot” where the user asks questions about history, and the agent must reply with the correct answer. Here’s 
the thing: The context needs to be fed from certain books, and some pdfs.

Why’s the best way to do this? The objective 
is to outperform in replying correctly to OpenAI models. Or, which model would be the best (or combination of model + RA
G) to get the best result?

Thanks!

```
I was just changing an existing langchain workflow from using an OpenAI model to using one from Replicate.

This showed 
the value of using `langchain` because it pretty much Just Worked to change the LLM model constructor I had used origina
lly, and then rerun all my code (in a Jupyter Notebook).

But it only 'pretty much' worked: in particular, when I invoke
d the OpenAI models, I would get an `AIMessage` object out of the chain.  When I invoke a Replicate model, I am just get
ting a string.

I imagine that this could cause issues if trying to extend a chain past the Replicate LLM to something l
ike an Output Parser couldn't it?

```
I work in education and envision a way of using RAG to help my students develop their writing. 

My vision is to have st
udents keep a digital portfolio of all their writing over the course of the semester or the year. I'd like to then use a
 RAG/LLM setup to provide students with feedback regarding their writing development over the course of the year. Ultima
tely, I'd like to load all of their writing into a RAG for my own analysis. I would be running this on an local LM Studi
o LLM for student privacy. 

Is Langchain an appropriate tool to achieve this? Would I be able to set it up to analyze t
housands of pages of student work? And can I design it so that it is a conversational interaction with a history window?

Is there a good way to integrate LangChain with a personal LLM RESTAPI yet?

I saw this post, but it doesn't explain any of the integration with basic chains li
ke LLMChain. There're so many integrations, but nothing I see so far for interacting with your own tooling?

The API jus
t has the basic response structure for a LLM, but that should just be one piece of the connection right?

```
Hi,

when thinking about RAG evaluation, everybody talks about RAGAS. It is generally nice to have a framework where you
 can evaluate your RAG workflows. However I tried it with an own local LLM as well as with the gpt-4-turbo model and the
 results really are not reliable. 

I adapted prompts to my language (german) and with my test dataset, the answer\_corr
ectness, answer\_relevancy scores are often times very low, zero or NaN, even if the answer is completely correct. 

&#x
200B;

Does anyone have similar experiences? 

With my experience, I am not feeling comfortable using ragas as results d
iffer heavenly from run to run, so all the evaluation doesn't really help me.

```
How do you get chat GPT to not oversummarize or abbreviate tasks. Despite explicitly telling it not to summarise, abbrev
iate or distill,  I am currently asking it to help me fine tune some scripts,  and chatGPT throws about 30% out the wind
ow. It does a great job of improving the tone and separability of the script, but entire segments get removed. My only s
olution is to go back and have gpt look at each paragraph, but that seems very much like the wrong way to go about it. A
s such I'm looking for suggestions or strategies that work for you in similar tasks.

&#x200B;

I get the same issue whe
n trying to turn my script into an article or social media post. 

&#x200B;

I\\m perfectly fine with using the OpenAI A
PI instead of ChatGPT or using things like langchain to achieve my goal.

```
Would a data store that is capable of doing entity resolution (ER; link and deduplicate all structured data regarding an
 entity, each in its own graph) be useful for RAG and LLMs?

We recently had a bunch of people contact us asking if they
 could use our ER solution as a 'source of truth' for LLM RAG. We don't know much about LLM or RAG so have been trying t
o get up to speed quickly, so wanted to ask the question here - if you work on RAG do you see a use case for a fuzzy sea
rch engine for structured data (which is effectively what our solution is), where the underlying data is considered a 's
ource of truth'?

Probably should mention the underlying data is deduplicated and linked (and searched) using rules base
d on various phonetic, similarity and distance algorithms (including Cosine). We don't use vectors or embeddings in our 
matching, although we plan to later.

We are just now trying to evaluate whether we should double down on the LLM/RAG sp
ace and build a LangChain connector for our solution.

Hey everyone,

So I am a lead software engineer in a SaaS startups we are exploring many use cases for implement GenAI s
olutions and are building most of them inhouse so we are writing a lot of prompts across various teams in product and en
gineering.

I was trying to explore some best tools for managing and testing prompts for different use cases things i am
 looking for : 

Must have :  
1. UI where PM's can go and test prompts - here they should be able to test same prompt o
n different model and a high level overview of cost incurred across these model for the result.  
2.  SDK/api to fetch t
hese prompts in code with versing and all for different use-cases.  
3. Dynamic rules for A/B testing of prompts.

Good 
to have :  
Maybe if the tool helps in crafting the prompts, create nested prompts workflows (chain of prompts) , etc.


Basically looking for Launchdarkly type solution for prompts where you can also create dynamic rules to load different p
rompt feature flag them based on user persona and teams.

Also interested in hearing how teams are managing or doing thi
s is there a better way or something that I am missing?

So this is unexpected. I am 29. I have been a software engineer for 10 years. I have a severe stutter. I am 95% non-verb
al. Last year, I was told that I talked too slowly to be worked with. This year, I can't get a job.

It's so surreal. I 
am up with the latest technology, coding in LangChain and making RAG models with AI and having also worked 7 years in fi
ntech and blockchain, but as soon as I open my mouth in an interview I am out.

What do I do? I am reckoning with my stu
tter and realising that people think I am retarded, as well as what this means for the rest of my life, but in the short
 term, wtf do I do.

\-------------------

EDIT:

Wow. I really was not expecting this response. Thank you everyone for 
your kind messages. I will follow up with the DMs.

I have decided to wash dishes in the short term while continuing the
 job search. All being said, I am a bloody good dishwasher!

\-------------------

EDIT 2:

Just answering some question
s:

**How am I homeless now?** I only started making over $100k in 2021-22. I could have been better with putting it awa
y, but have lived off my savings for 13 months now.

**Have I gone to speech therapy?** Yes, for several years, but they
 worked with me to accept that I stutter instead of trying to fix it.

```
I am working on a chat application in Langchain, Python. The idea is that user submits some pdf files that the chat mode
l is trained on and then asks questions from the model regarding those documents. The embeddings are stored in Chromadb 
vector database. So effectively a RAG-based solution.  


Now, both the creation and storage of embeddings are working f
ine and also chat is working good. However, I am storing my custom metadata to the embeddings and some ids. The code for
 that is given as under:  


    def read_docs(pdf_file):
 pdf_loader = PyPDFLoader(pdf_file)
 pdf_documents = pdf_loade
r.load()

 text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
 documents = text_splitter.split_do
cuments(pdf_documents)
 
 return documents
    
    def generate_and_store_embeddings(documents, pdf_file, user_id):
   
     client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path='./trained_db')
        collection = client.get_or_create_collection('PDF_E
mbeddings', embedding_function=embedding_functions.OpenAIEmbeddingFunction(api_key=config['OPENAI_API_KEY'], model_name=
configs.EMBEDDINGS_MODEL))
        now = datetime.now()
    
        #custom metadata and ids I want to store along with
 the embeddings for each pdf
        metadata = {'source': pdf_file.filename, 'user': str(user_id), 'created_at': now.st
rftime('%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S')}
        ids = [str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in range(len(documents))]
    
        try:
        
    vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(
                        documents,         embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_k
ey=config['OPENAI_API_KEY'], model=configs.EMBEDDINGS_MODEL),
                        persist_directory='./trained_db',

                        collection_name = collection.name, 
                        client = client,
                   
     ids = ids,
                        collection_metadata = {item: value for (item, value) in metadata.items()}
      
              )
            vectordb.persist()
            
        except Exception as err:
            print(f'An erro
r occured: {err=}, {type(err)=}')
            return {'answer': 'An error occured while generating embeddings. Please ch
eck terminal for more details.'}
        return vectordb

Now, what I want is to retrieve those ids and metadata associa
ted with the pdf file rather than all the ids/metadata in the collection. This is so that when a user enters the pdf fil
e to delete the embeddings of, I can retrieve the metadata and the ids of *that pdf file only*  and then delete those em
beddings from the collection.

all -  [ Complex PDF Chunking: Which one works better for you: RecursiveCharactersplitter or Unstructured.io ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1bhv87c/complex_pdf_chunking_which_one_works_better_for/) , 2024-03-20-0909
```
Hi,

I built a RAG app with complex pdfs and now want to find the best chunking strategy for complex pdfs. Here I wanted
 to discuss if (from your experience) the RecursiveCharaterSplitter from Langchain or chunking the docs by title with th
e UnstructuredFileLoader from Langchain worked better?

&#x200B;

This is how I implemented both but I am not sure which
 one I should use. Generally I think Unstructured should be better but when evaluating results with RAGAS, somehow the R
ecursiveCharacterSplitter is better.

`if chunking_strategy == 'recursive':`  
 `loader = DirectoryLoader(directory_path
,`  
 `glob='*.pdf',`  
 `loader_cls=PyPDFLoader)`  
 `documents = loader.load()`  
 `text_splitter = RecursiveCharacter
TextSplitter(chunk_size=chunk_size,`  
 `chunk_overlap=chunk_overlap,`  
 `#length_function = len`  
`)`  
 `texts = tex
t_splitter.split_documents(documents)`  
 `if chunking_strategy == 'unstructured':`  
 `texts = []`  
 `for i in files:`
  
 `loader = UnstructuredFileLoader(`  
 `i, strategy='hi_res', mode='elements', chunking_strategy='by_title',`  
 `ocr
_languages='eng+deu',`  
 `max_characters=4000,`  
 `new_after_n_chars=3800,`  
 `combine_text_under_n_chars=2000`  
`)`
  
 `docs = loader.load()`  
 `texts.append(docs)`

```
I have created a chromadb with `OpenAIEmbeddings(model='text-embedding-ada-002', show_progress_bar=True,chunk_size=20)` 
 
I took a document from the DB and using .get() I got its embeddings.

I also calculated embeddings using same class an
d `.embed_query()`

I subtracted and then `.sum()` and got a difference of `0.0001654693725411943`.

I would expect a mu
ch smaller difference if not 0

Any explanations?

Hello everyone,

Check out this step-by-step detailed tutorial on building and scaling a PDF Q&A Application using Pinec
one, Langchain and Inferless

&#x200B;

uto=webp&s=440399212d3feb03e861759a31602e2cde0dc7fb)

Alongside, the detailed quick deploy guide, it also includes cost 
analysis on how you can save upto 84% cost with an example of processing 3000 documents and nearly 10,000 queries every 
month, all while dramatically cutting your costs from $1800 ( AWS) to just $250 a month on Inferless.

MachineLearning -  [ [D] What Is Your LLM Tech Stack in Production? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1b4sdru/d_what_is_your_llm_tech_stack_in_production/) , 2024-03-20-0909
```
Curious what everybody is using to implement LLM powered apps for production usage and your experience with these toolin
gs and advice. 

This is what I am using for some RAG prototypes I have been building for users in finance and capital m
arkets.

**Pre-processing\ETL:**
Unstructured.io + Spark, Airflow

**Embedding model:**
Cohere Embed v3
Previously using
 OpenAI Ada but Cohere has significantly better retrieval recall and precision for my use case. Also exploring other ope
n weights embedding models

**Vector Database:**
Elasticsearch previously but now using Pinecone

**LLM:**
Gone through 
quite a few including hosted and self-hosted options. Went with gpt4 early during prototyping then switched to gpt3.5-tu
rbo for more manageable costs and eventually open weights models. 

Now using a fine-tuned Llama2 70B model self hosted 
with vLLM 

**LLM Framework:**
Started with Langchain initially but found it cumbersome to extend as the app became more
 complex. Tried implementing it in LlamaIndex at some point just to learn and found it just as bad. Went back to Langcha
in and now I am in the midst of replacing it with my own logic

What is everyone else using?

Edit: correct model Llama2
 70B

Hey there, Redditors!

I'm back with the latest installment on creating dependable AI data pipelines for real-world prod
uction.

If you've been following along, you know I'm on a mission to move beyond the '[thin OpenAI wrapper](https://top
oteretes.notion.site/Going-beyond-Langchain-Weaviate-and-towards-a-production-ready-modern-data-platform-7351d77a1eba40a
ab4394c24bef3a278?pvs=4)' trend and tackle the challenges of building robust data pipelines.

After a few months of work
, we integrated cognitive architecture with [keepi.ai](https://www.keepi.ai) 

We aim to explore with our demo:

**1. Co
ntext sanitization**  
The world of AI is fast-moving, and we've realized that the context is becoming a building block 
we refer to as a crucial part of future cognitive architecture.  
**2. Best Practices for AI Memory**  
In this rapidly 
evolving landscape, there are no established best practices. You'll need to make educated bets on tools and processes, k
nowing that things will change. We assume that having traditional data engineering practices + frameworks + classifiers 
and other AI solutions can solve a lot of standard hurdles  
**3. AI Frameworks**  
They are trying to do too much, too 
fast, too broad. We want to find a pattern and a correct layer of abstraction for the AI memory to fit new industry.

How does it work?

Next steps:  
I have questions for you:

1. Is context sanitization relevant for you?
2. How do you m
anage metadata? 
3. How do you prepare data for LLMs?
4. Are there any data enrichment steps you perform?

```
Hi Everyone, I need a suggestion to create AI courses for students ( Hands-on AI projects). I am thinking about the late
st AI trends such as Langchain, RAG, and vector databases. In each project, there can be multiple tasks, and the main th
ing is each task should have an automated system in which we can verify whether students have done it correctly or not.


For example: Project with visualization cannot be automatically tested. 

For example: A project with visualization can
