What are the main drivers that you guys are going to make the AI Agent market explode. Obviously they are pretty useful 
already, but what factors, or expected improvements are going to make it so that everyone is using an agent, or potentia
lly hundreds of agents in their day to day.

Beyond just LLMs getting better, I'm really curious what creators are waiti
ng for to make agent systems that can complete truly complex and organizational tasks. What needs to improve?

```
I am building a small tool to assist my team with the project we are working on. The idea is to be able to interact with
 it via a Discord channel, where users can ask it for different kinds of help. In a non-exhaustive fashion, those are:


1. Recall from chat history from Discord what decisions were made about some engineering problems and solutions that wou
ld be used.
2. Provide information about the project from the documentation or source code.
3. Provide ideas and code ex
amples for the implementation of coding solutions.
4. Update the knowledge base with new chats, documentation and source
 code updates.

What are the best ways to build contexts for each of those use cases? I've been using Pinecone to tokeni
ze everything from source code, to chat histories, to source code. Then using langchain build a RetrievalQA using embedd
ings from Pinecone and invoke it with a query. Is that really the best way to do it? I'm unsure if there's a better-suit
ed method for each of the use cases, as I see that Langchain supports conversation memory.

Also if the question is of m
ixed purpose and requires using multiple contexts to retrieve an answer, how would that best be achieved? Right now I am
 processing questions with NLP to extract tool calls from Langchain and try calling those tools.

Thank you for reading 
and for your help. :)

Been working on some stuff for a while, with some guiding from a couple psychologists I know. They seemed to be pretty i
mpressed by some of the responses, which of course is good but also a bit surprising considering I feel like I haven't d
one 'that much'. Just been trying out some different layouts and extra data, but I guess if it works it works!

This isn
't meant as a replacement for therapy or anything, but more a simple tool at the moment. Where I'm from we struggle in p
ublic therapy with long wait time in public therapy (50+ days), and fairly expensive private solutions. I think working 
it in to more long-term format with a better memory, and also combining with irl therapy would be cool in the long run.

```
Hey r/reactjs,

I wanted to share a project that some friends and I have been working on for the past few months. It's c
alled [KaibanJS](https://www.kaibanjs.com/), and it's an open-source framework for building AI multi-agent systems in Ja
vaScript, with a focus on React integration.

We started this project because we couldn't find a good native JS solution
 for working with AI agents that fit well with the React ecosystem. So, we decided to build one ourselves.

**Some key f
eatures:**

* Designed to work seamlessly with React and state management libraries
* Runs in the browser
* Includes a K
anban-style UI for visualizing agent workflows (think Trello for AI agents)
* Built on top of LangChain for robust orche
stration

We're still ironing out some details, but we'd love to get feedback from the React community. If you're intere
sted in AI and React, we'd be really grateful if you could check it out and let us know what you think.

You can find mo
re information and try it out here:

* Project website: [https://www.kaibanjs.com/](https://www.kaibanjs.com/)
* GitHub 
repo: [https://github.com/kaiban-ai/KaibanJS](https://github.com/kaiban-ai/KaibanJS)
* Quick start guide (video): [https
://youtu.be/NFpqFEl-URY](https://youtu.be/NFpqFEl-URY)

We're especially interested in hearing:

1. Is this something yo
u could see yourself using in a React project?
2. What features would make it more useful for your React workflows?
3. A
ny bugs or issues you notice?

Thanks in advance for any feedback.

Hi Everyone,

I am running into an issue related to the use of memory in Langgraph.

* I am trying to create a workflow 
that also includes some safety checks
* After passing these safety checks, it should answer the initial question
* Howev
er, i dont want those outputs of the safety checks to be taken up in the conversational memory

I am looking for a way w
here I can insert a part of the output of nodes in memory and others in objects that wont be taken up in memory. In the 
example (input/output should be part of messages, output of guardrails node in guardrails\_state)

I found this: [https:
//github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-academy/blob/main/module-2/multiple-schemas.ipynb](https://github.com/langchain-ai/l
angchain-academy/blob/main/module-2/multiple-schemas.ipynb)

However, i am having a hard time bringing that together wit
h the following class:  
class State(TypedDict):  
guardrails\_state: Literal\['Yes', 'No'\]  
messages: Annotated\[list
\[AnyMessage\], add\_messages\]

So in below example, i would like to exclude the output of node\_guardrails from the me
ssages object and would want to store that in guardrails\_state. This way the memory of the conversation would just be i
nput and output.

Can someone help me?

```
[NaturalAgents](https://github.com/NaturalAgents/NaturalAgents) is the easiest way to create AI Agents in a notion-style
 editor. It's no-code and enables anyone to build sophisticated agents using simple macros. It's current in its MVP stat
e, but it is fully open-source and will be actively maintained.

How this is different from other agent builders -

1. N
o boilerplate code (imagine langchain for multiple agents)
2. No code experience
3. Can easily share and build with othe
rs
4. Readable/organized agent outputs
5. Abstracts agent communications without visual complexity (image large drag and
 drop flowcharts)

Would love to hear thoughts and feel free to reach out if you're interested in contributing!

```
In an attempt to at least get the very basic mechanisms of a chatbot with history working, I need to be able to input a 
prompt and receive a singular response. This [article](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/expression_language/how_to
/message_history/) being one of many examples on the langchain website where they use `RunnableWithMessageHistory` to im
plement a chat history. My issue is, any iteration I've tried of trying to use this function, while the history portion 
works fine, all my outputs always end up giving me multiple responses. Like it will go back and forth with itself like t
his: `' I asked you earlier.\nAI: Ahah, you asked me earlier, and I remember! Your name is Bob!\nHuman: Ahah, yeah! How 
do you remember all this? You're so smart!\nAI: Well, I'm designed'`.

  
This specifically happens when I use `Runnable
WithMessageHistory` and not when I do model.invoke. I've also tried variations of chat prompt templates (`ChatPromptTemp
late`) that tells the system to not give me multiple responses, and while it adheres to most of my other instructions, t
hat portion of it is ignored. Any and all help with this would be so appreciated it has become a huge blocker for me. Th
ank you to the community in advance!

```
I've created a Jupyter notebook that successfully implements Langchains' chat history feature. But I can't figure out ho
w to get it working with Chainlit. Specifically, which code should go under '@cl.on\_chat\_start' and which should go un
der '@cl.on\_message'. Anyone have any pointers?

Here's the relevant code of my notebook:

    chat_history = []
    
 
   text = 'Hi. My name is Bob. I am 40 years old.'
    chain = prompt_template | model | parser
    
    response = chai
n.invoke(
        {'chat_history': chat_history,
        'text': text})
    
    chat_history.extend(
        [
        
    HumanMessage(content=text),
            AIMessage(content=response),
        ]
    )

And here's my Chainlit code. C
hainlit works, it just doesn't remember conversation history.

    @cl.on_chat_start
    async def on_chat_start():
    

        model = ChatVertexAI(

            strea
ming=True,
        )
    
        system_prompt = 'You are a knowledgeable and useful AI'
    
        prompt_template =
 ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
            [
                ('system', system_prompt),
                ('user', '{t

            ]
        )

    async def on_message(message: cl.Message):
        runnable = cast(R
unnable, cl.user_session.get('runnable'))
    
        msg = cl.Message(content='')
    
        async for chunk in runn

```
Im having trouble using the text splitters in langchain. 

I tried the example in the docs for the recursive... Tried al
l the combinations possible as ' ', '', line jump and even double line jump. The docs says that the defaults are \['\\n\
\n', '\\n', ' ', ''\] but it wont split my markdown as I want which are the white lines.

[https://python.langchain.com/
v0.1/docs/modules/data\_connection/document\_transformers/recursive\_text\_splitter/](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/
docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/recursive_text_splitter/)

The text splitter (non recursive) also won
t work. Tried all combinations.

My code is:

    from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
  
  
    # Load an example document
    with open('data_dictionaries/odata_schema_ARG_inversion.md') as f:
        data_di
ctionary = f.read()
    
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
        chunk_size=3000,
        chunk_over
lap=0,
        is_separator_regex=False,
    )
    
    texts = text_splitter.create_documents([data_dictionary])
    # 
print each element in the list
    
    for text in texts:
        print('DOCUMENT')
        print(text)

I cant find a 
solution to the text splitters where I can pass a simple markdown text like and get the documents for each separate para
graph. As you can see I dont want any overlap and setted the maximum chunk size to 3000 but this should not be changing 
anything because this is the max

Hi everyone,

I'm currently working on an AI chatbot that's supposed to respond based on my resume. I've been experiment
ing with both Gemma2:2b and Mistral, but I keep running into the same issue with both models: they seem to 'skip' certai
n parts of the resume when responding to queries.

I'm wondering if this problem could be due to the way I'm processing 
the resume (which is in PDF format) or if it's related to the input pipeline I'm using. I've tried tweaking the PDF, and
 it seems to have alleviated the issue, but it still persists.

all -  [ Node based LLM interactive tool ](https://github.com/Xerophayze/XeroFlow) , 2024-10-11-0912
```
Hey everyone, I've been working on this project for about a week and thought maybe I would bring it up here as a resourc
e for people to use. I've developed a node based system programmed in Python that allows you to create custom nodes and 
be able to interact with multiple LLMs at the same time. I recently just introduced a chat node that allows you to inter
act with the LLM in a chat-based situation like in chat GPT. And I'm currently working on integrating langchain and rag.
 The system is designed so you can develop your own nodes and create your own workflows for doing many different things.
 I also have a node for developing long form content. It's interesting being able to have the system spit out 38 page re
ports or stories or summaries. It has web search capability if you have API access to a JSON based web search system. I 
currently have searXNG set up in a local virtual box system that I'm going to make available on my Google share for peop
le to download if they just want to run a local web search engine.  
Anyway you can check it out here at my GitHub. Let 
me know what you think and if you have other ideas for different types of nodes, I would love to hear it.

```
I am trying to prepare myself for the job market, however environmental science data science jobs aren't really out ther
e beyond academia. Therefore I am refocusing on marketing jobs, and in turn LLMs/AI.

My background is a solid understan
ding of the 'classics', i.e RF, PLSR, log. and linear regression, SVM/SVR, gradient boost, etc. Supervised vs. unsupervi
sed, training/testing/validation splits. Preprocessing techniques.

I have read attention is all you need and followed t
utorials to recreate the core concepts of self-attention and multi-attention heads.

The next step that I have been lead
 to believe is the correct step into the world of LLMs is LangChain -> LangGraph. However, the tutorials of LangChain se
em to funnel one into using pre-made models (fine) and their API's - requiring keys, which require purchasing tokens. I 
have downloaded Llama 3.2-1B and am trying to create a chatbot of some sort, however this is not as straightforward as I
 thought it would be.

So now I have a few questions and would be thankful if anybody would share their insights:

1) Is
 my decision to focus on LangChain a logical next step given my background,  or are there other stepping stones that I s
hould be revisiting first?

2) Is there a book/resource that promotes creating a chat-bot or similar LLM based applicati
ons entirely with open-source material?

3) If I want to create a chat-bot UI/UX, and bring it beyond the terminal promp
t, this would require learning a new program, like Django or a similar webframework?

4) After having spent several week
s working on familiarizing myself with the concept of attention, and the creation of NN models through defining individu
al layers, I now have a feeling after having looked ahead that this will not play much of a role - as something like Lan
gChain seems to simplify a lot of the steps involved? Although this is just a recent impression, and I would be happy to
 be corrected on this front.

Thanks for any input and your time!

```
Hi everyone ✌️

I'm excited to share **RepoGPT**, an open-source project I've been working on that combines **Next.js an
d** **LangChain** to create an AI-powered assistant for interacting with your GitHub repositories using natural language
.

**What is RepoGPT?**

RepoGPT allows you to 'chat' with your codebase. By leveraging natural language processing, you
 can:

* Ask questions about your repository's code.
* Get summaries of functions, classes, or entire files.
* Request e
xplanations of complex algorithms.
* Retrieve lists of API endpoints, components, or other code structures.

**Technical
 Stack Overview**

* **Next.js**: Used as the web framework for both the frontend and backend, taking advantage of its A
PI routes and SSR capabilities.
* **LangChain**: Utilized for managing LLM calls and embeddings, enabling seamless inter
action with language models.
* **PostgreSQL with pgvector**: Acts as our vector storage solution, allowing efficient sim
ilarity search and retrieval of relevant code snippets.

**LangChain Integration**

* **LLM Calls**: Manages prompts and
 interactions with language models, abstracting the complexity of direct API calls.
* **Embeddings**: Handles the creati
on and storage of embeddings for code snippets, enabling efficient similarity searches.

**Code Integration Example**

I
f you're interested in how it all comes together, feel free to check out the API route handling the chat functionality:


👉 **GitHub Link**[src/app/api/chat/route.ts](https://github.com/mbarinov/repogpt/blob/main/src/app/api/chat/route.ts)


This file showcases how we:

* Receive user queries from the frontend.
* Use LangChain to process the query and interact
 with the language model.
* Retrieve relevant code snippets using pgvector similarity search.
* Generate a coherent resp
onse to the user.

**Getting Started**

RepoGPT is open-source and available on GitHub: [github.com/mbarinov/repogpt](ht
tps://github.com/mbarinov/repogpt)

**Requirements:**

* **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
* **pnpm** (preferred package manag
er)
* **Docker** (for setting up PostgreSQL with pgvector)
* **OpenAI API Key** (for AI functionalities)

Detailed insta
llation instructions are provided in the README.

**Why I Built RepoGPT**

Navigating large codebases can be time-consum
ing, especially when onboarding new projects. By integrating Next.js with AI capabilities, I wanted to create a tool tha
t streamlines this process for developers.

**Seeking Remote Opportunities**

On a personal note, I'm currently looking 
for remote job opportunities in EU time zones. If you know of any positions or are interested in collaborating, I'd love
 to connect!

**Links**

* **GitHub Repository**: [github.com/mbarinov/repogpt](https://github.com/mbarinov/repogpt)

all -  [ RepoGPT – AI-Powered GitHub Assistant Built with LangChain ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1fzncv8/repogpt_aipowered_github_assistant_built_with/) , 2024-10-11-0912
```
Hi everyone,

I'm excited to share [RepoGPT](https://github.com/mbarinov/repogpt), an open-source tool I've been working
 on that allows developers to interact with their GitHub repositories using natural language. It leverages **LangChain**
 to provide intelligent insights into your codebase.

**What is RepoGPT?**

RepoGPT enables you to 'chat' with your code
base. Using natural language queries, you can:

* Ask how specific functionalities are implemented.
* Get summaries of c
ode sections or entire repositories.
* Retrieve lists of functions, classes, or API endpoints.
* Request explanations of
 complex algorithms.

[Chat with a repo](https://preview.redd.it/ti16oupo8ptd1.jpg?width=5088&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75
dd5da0519e16a7d496a5657b8403000658f45a)

**Technical Highlights**

* **LangChain Integration**: Utilizes LangChain for p
rompt management, chaining LLM calls, and handling conversational context, making complex interactions smoother.
* **Dat
a Processing with pgvector**: Uses PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension for efficient vector storage and similarity se
arch, enabling fast retrieval of relevant code snippets.
* **Backend Stack**: Built with Node.js and Prisma ORM for robu
st database interactions.

**Getting Started**

RepoGPT is open-source and available on GitHub: [github.com/mbarinov/rep
ogpt](https://github.com/mbarinov/repogpt)

**Requirements:**

* **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
* **pnpm** (preferred packa
ge manager)
* **Docker** (for PostgreSQL with pgvector setup)
* **OpenAI API Key** (for AI functionalities)

Detailed in
stallation instructions are provided in the README.

**Future Plans**

* **Advanced Query Capabilities**: Implement soph
isticated AI ReAct Agent for deeper code analysis.
* **Local AI Models Integration**: Considering Ollama integration for
 users preferring local processing.

**Feedback and Collaboration**

I would love to hear your thoughts, especially rega
rding the use of LangChain in this project. Any suggestions or contributions are highly welcome!

**Seeking Remote Oppor
tunities**

On a personal note, I'm currently looking for remote job opportunities in EU time zones. If you know of any 
positions or are interested in collaborating, please feel free to reach out.

all -  [ Does this stack qualify for a full time ML role? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1fzn73x/does_this_stack_qualify_for_a_full_time_ml_role/) , 2024-10-11-0912
```
Hi everyone. I'd appreciate some feedback regarding this. I'm a CS undergrad towards the end of 2nd year. Still 2 more y
ears to graduate.

My current ML stack is: PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, TensorFlow, Keras, Transformers, Pandas, NumPy, S
cikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Weights & Biases

And I'm working towards getting the following stack of technologies under my 
belt:  
--- Cloud computing: AWS, GCP  
--- LLM framework and libraries: Langchain, NLTK, LlamaIndex  
--- Big data tech
nologies: Hadoop, Spark  
--- Production: Docker, Kubernetes

All I have is a 6 month part time internship experience, d
eveloping chatbots and implementing a few ML algorithms at a startup and some personal projects.

My plan is to learn th
e stack that I've mentioned above and then create production ready applications powered by AI and then start applying fo
r full time ML roles, preferably remote roles, because where I'm living, bachelors degree is a necessary requirement to 
get any job at any company.

Any role will do, all I want is a job. I'd appreciate it if someone can spare some time, re
view my profile, and give some feedback.

Hey, does anybody have any examples of well working and useful agents that generate value autonomously as we speak? I'm 
struggling to find examples. Maybe the replit agents oder something similar but nothing really innovative and new that's
 not 'just' autocompleting.

all -  [ Semantic chunking  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1fzibfx/semantic_chunking/) , 2024-10-11-0912
```
Semantic chunking works well for me but the chunk sizes are big. As the chunk sizes are big am forced to use contextualc
ompressionretriver. 
What base compressor can be used here?
LLMChainExtractor works like a charm but is costly because o
f the chunk sizes.
Flashrerank compressor doesn't add anything.

If my idea is to reduce the cost and replace the llm ca
ll during contextual compressor, what would options do I have?

Dataset being used is Paul Graham essays from kaggle.

```
I'm developing a RAG application and associating different type of metadata to chunks based on their sources.

These chu
nks are being processed into a Langchain pipeline using OpenAI embedding models, OpenAI LLM, and Pinecone DB.

When I'm 
providing the most relevant chunks for RAG, I thought it'd be a good idea to include chunks' metadata in the context to 
provide a better understanding of where the text is being sourced from. But I'm not sure if converting this metadata (ra
w JSON objects) into normal sentences / plain language would improve the final outputted answer's accuracy. I'm also wei
ghing whether or not invoking OpenAI's LLM to create this plain language is worth the api costs.

Has anyone encountered
 this scenario before? Any relevant resources are appreciated.

```
Hi all,

I am an international in the US. I have been looking for Data Science/Data Analytics/Machine learning Engineer 
roles since February 2024. I have applied to almost 1000+ applications and got ZERO interviews. I have tailored my resum
e 40-50% of the times. There have been days when I spent a lot of time on tailoring to the job descriptions and sent out
 3-4 properly made applications. Other days, I have submitted 10-15 applications per day with minimal tailoring. I have 
used [jobright.ai](http://jobright.ai) for my application matching and most of them were above 75% matching. This is ver
y demotivating and I don't know what to do at this point.

I know my resume is long because the companies want a broad r
ange of skillset for DS roles. If I try to shorten it, then I miss out on the similarity score. Can you evaluate my resu
me and tell me what am I doing wrong in here? I will not mind if it comes to roasting my resume as long as it helps me g
et at least an interview.

Also, is the job market for Data Science roles saturated? Should I just drop the idea to beco
me a data scientist at this point?

But these feel overly reductive, since they don't address complexities like:  
1) when
 to retrieve vs. just respond immediately to reduce latency  
2) rely on existing context previously retrieved in the co
nversation instead of retrieving again at the current turn  
3) partition LLM context between retrieved information and 
past conversation history.

I'm sure some teams already have good systems for this, would appreciate pointers!

MachineLearning -  [ Built a web agent which call fill Google forms based on the user details [P] ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fozud5/built_a_web_agent_which_call_fill_google_forms/) , 2024-10-11-0912
```
GitHub repo : [https://github.com/shaRk-033/web-agent](https://github.com/shaRk-033/web-agent)

Tried to solve it using 
two approaches:

# 1: Basic Scraping and Filling

This is the straightforward approach. The agent scrapes the form’s HTM
L and uses fixed XPaths to find and fill in the required fields.

* It pulls the form’s HTML, locates the fields with se
t XPaths, and inputs the answers. It’s a direct and simple method.
* If the form changes or an element isn’t where it’s 
expected, the process can fail and may need manual adjustments.

[basic approach](https://preview.redd.it/5e8g4a1k4xqd1.
png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8e984e4feaee2f0453b08c8696768c40a2a5c20)

2. Using LangChain Agents and tool call
ing

* LangChain Agent**:** The agent handles everything by using the LLM’s reasoning to decide what to do next, includi
ng generating those tricky XPaths.
* Error Handling**:** If something goes wrong (like an element not found), the agent 
tries again with better XPaths until it gets the job done.

[using langchain agents](https://preview.redd.it/948i88pl4xq
d1.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed1e6c19efec9f4cbbbd6ab5a22558f221cf745f)

Any recommendations to improve this w
ould be welcome. Also, if anyone has ideas on building similar web agents to automate other tasks, it would be great to 
hear them. :)

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Swapping Embedding Models for an LLM ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fktvbj/p_swapping_embedding_models_for_an_llm/) , 2024-10-11-0912
```
How tightly coupled is an embedding model to a language model?

Taking an example from Langchain's tutorials, they use O
llama's _nomic-embed-text_ for embedding and _Llama3.1_ for the understanding and Q/A. I don't see any documentation abo
ut Llama being built on embeddings from this embedding model. 

Intuition suggests that a different embedding model may 
produce outputs of other sizes or produce a different tensor for a character/word, which would have an impact on the res
ults of the LLM. So would changing an embedding model require retraining/fine-tuning the LLM as well?

I need to use a e
mbedding model for code snippets and text. Do I need to find a specialized embedding model for that? If yes, how will ll
ama3.1 ingest the embeddings?

deeplearning -  [ What is the best approach for Parsing and Retrieving Code Context Across Multiple Files in a Hierarc ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1fh58oz/what_is_the_best_approach_for_parsing_and/) , 2024-10-11-0912
```
I want to implement a Code-RAG system on a code directory where I need to:

* Parse and load all the files from folders 
and subfolders while excluding specific file extensions.
* Embed and store the parsed content into a vector store.
* Ret
rieve relevant information based on user queries.

However, I’m facing two major challenges:

**File Parsing and Loading
:** What’s the most efficient method to parse and load files in a hierarchical manner (reflecting their folder structure
)? Should I use Langchain’s directory loader, or is there a better way? I came across the Tree-sitter tool in Claude-dev
’s repo, which is used to build syntax trees for source files—would this be useful for hierarchical parsing?

**Cross-Fi
le Context Retrieval:** If the relevant context for a user’s query is spread across multiple files located in different 
subfolders, how can I fine-tune my retrieval system to identify the correct context across these files? Would reranking 
resolve this, or is there a better approach?

**Query Translation:** Do I need to use Something like Multi-Query or RAG-
Fusion to achieve better retrieval for hierarchical data?

\[I want to understand how tools like [continue.dev](http://c
ontinue.dev/) and [claude-dev](https://github.com/saoudrizwan/claude-dev) work\]
