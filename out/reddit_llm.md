Hi all!    


One thing we've been working on in the background is splitting our core functionality to langchain-core to
 make LangChain more stable and reliable. This should be invisible to the eye and will happen in the background for the 
next two weeks, and we‚Äôd recommend not using langchain-core directly until then, but we‚Äôre flagging for transparency.  W
e want to provide a bit of visibility into our thinking and future steps we‚Äôre going to take before announcing it more w
idely.  GitHub Discussion (we will be most closely monitoring this: [https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/discussio
ns/13823](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/discussions/13823))  


Posting here because this subreddit has alwa

Hey everyone üëã

So many things happening in recent weeks it's almost impossible to keep up! All good things for us devel
opers, builders, and AI enthusiasts.

As you know, many people are experimenting with GPTs to build their own custom Cha
tGPT. I've built a couple of bots just for fun but quickly realized that I needed more control over a few things. Luckil
y, just a few days after the release of OpenAI GPTs, the LangChain team released OpenGPTs, an open-source alternative!


So, I‚Äôve been reading about OpenGPTs and wrote a short introductory blog post comparing it to GPTs so that anyone like m
e who's just getting started can quickly get up to speed. 

Here it is: [https://www.gettingstarted.ai/introduction-over
view-open-source-langchain-opengpts-versus-openai-gpts/](https://www.gettingstarted.ai/introduction-overview-open-source
-langchain-opengpts-versus-openai-gpts/)

Happy to discuss in the comments here any questions or thoughts you have! 

Ha
ve you tried OpenGPTs yet?

Tous les exemples de Langchain et sur des c√¢lins cr√©ent de la m√©moire en collant toute l'historique dans chaque invite. 
Cela semble violer assez rapidement la longueur d'invite d'entr√©e maximale. Et c'est cher. Chatgpt utilise-t-il quelque

 le convo comme m√©moire.

Mais alors la question; Comment d√©passent-ils les limites rapides? Chunking n'aide pas car il 
n'obtient toujours pas de contexte dans ce cas entre les invites. Peut-√™tre qu'ils posent la m√™me question avec des morc

I'm looking to process an entire PDF document.  The document is mostly standard text and 6-20 paragraphs.  Some sections
 are larger than the token limits. I want to re-write or pull info from the PDF.  This would require me to use each chun
k of text from the PDF to extract the data I'm looking for.

At first I was thinking of using Langchain for a summarizat
ion chain but I'm not sure this is my correct path.

I do not really want to map\_reduce because the initial data is imp
ortant and I'm slightly fearful of losing data before processing to get extracted info.  The summarization chains don't 
really allow for custom prompts like 'give me all statistical data from this text' (or if it does, I missed it).

Now I 
am thinking of just chunking the PDF and using a straight chat to process each chunk and combine the results at the end.


Looking for some advice on how to tackle this and what approach you'd use? 

Thanks!

```
I have a collection of records that are scraped from HTML tables and, consequently, have a natural 'type' and no overlap
 between them: *e.g.* sports, medicine, history, *etc.*

However, the embedding-based retrieval in my RAG QA application
 is pretty bad across types, likely due to the documents themselves being overly long for the embedding and being simila
r on average.  I would resort to splitting and chunking to shrink the documents, but the challenge is that an element at
 the very top or bottom of a document may have relevance to the complete opposite end; it benefits the LLM QA component 
to have that entire context to answer queries.

*Without reworking document ingestion, my solution is to classify the us
er's prompt into one of those metadata categories (sports, medicine, history) using a few-shot learning prompt.  Then, u
se that classification as a metadata filter in a retriever so only that type is in consideration for the embedding ANN l
ookup.*  **Is there a name for this kind of pattern?  And does anyone have other recommendations?  Obvious downsides (be
yond the need for a second LLM call)?**

**I understand how to implement this, but does LangChain have an existing class
 (or classes) best suited for this?**

what I want is, the agent
 could suggest that ' I did not find the product iphone, but found some similar names, do you mean iphone4, iphone5 ...'

```
I have worked with LangChain a good bit now and one of the main benefits is that it makes LLM APIs stateful.

What I mea
n by 'stateful' is that the the hidden state of the transformer is preserved. This is, of course, done by LangChain by s
aving the entire chat history you've had so far, and resending that entire history to the LLM API every time a new input
 is sent to the LLM.

Now the question is - why aren't LLM APIs themselves stateful? It seems like a massive use of comp
ute to recompute every single input token every single time. Why doesn't OpenAI (and others) simply give me a session id
 and save the state of the LLM on their side, so I can just follow up with my latest input string (alongside the unique 
session id), as opposed to having to resend \*the entire conversation\* every single time I make an API call?

This woul
d drastically reduce latency, reduce the load on their servers, etc. I understand it's slightly more complicated and res
ource intense to do so, but is it really that hard? I'd pay way more per in/out token for a stateful API.

So why aren't
 they stateful? What am I missing?

```
Hey there, Redditors! 

I'm back with the latest installment on creating dependable AI data pipelines for real-world pro
duction. 

If you've been following along, you know I'm on a mission to move beyond the '[thin OpenAI wrapper](https://t
opoteretes.notion.site/Going-beyond-Langchain-Weaviate-and-towards-a-production-ready-modern-data-platform-7351d77a1eba4
0aab4394c24bef3a278?pvs=4)' trend and tackle the challenges of building robust data pipelines. 

With 18 months of hands
-on experience and many user interviews, I realized that with the probabilistic nature of systems, we need better\_testi
ng.gpt:

  
**1. As you build you should test**  
The world of AI is a fast-moving one, and we've realized that just wor
king on systems is not an optimal design choice. By the time your product ships, it might already be using outdated tech
nology. So, what's the lesson here? Embrace change, test along, but be prepared to switch pace.  
**2. No Best Practices
 Yet for RAGs**  
In this rapidly evolving landscape, there are no established best practices. You'll need to make educa
ted bets on tools and processes, knowing that things will change. With the RAG testing tool, I tried allowing for testin
g many potential parameter combinations **automatically**  
**3. Testing Frameworks**  
If your generative AI product do
esn't have users giving feedback, then you are building in isolation. I used [Deepeval](https://github.com/confident-ai/
deepeval) to generate test sets, and they will soon support synthetic test set generation  
**4. Infographics only go so
 far**  
AI researchers and data scientists, while brilliant, end up in a loop of pursuing Twitter promotional content. 
New ways are promoted via new content pieces, but ideally, we need something above simple tracing but less than full-fle
dged analytics. To do this, I stored test outputs in Postgres and created a Superset instance to visualize the results  

**5. Bridging the Gap between VectorDBs**  
There's a noticeable number of Vector DBs. To ensure smooth product develop
ment, we need to be able to switch to best best-performing one, especially since user interviews signal that they might 
start deteriorating after loading 50 million rows

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Relevance Extraction in RAG Pipelines ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/17k6iha/d_relevance_extraction_in_rag_pipelines/) , 2023-11-25-0909
```
I came across this interesting problem in RAG, what I call **Relevance Extraction**.

After retrieving relevant document
s (or chunks), these chunks are often large and may contain several portions **irrelevant** to the query at hand. Stuffi
ng the entire chunk into an LLM prompt impacts token-cost as well as response accuracy (distracting the LLM with irrelev
ant text), and and can also cause bumping into context-length limits.

So a critical step in most pipelines is **Relevan
ce Extraction**: use the LLM to extract **verbatim** only the portions relevant to the query. This is known by other nam
es, e.g. LangChain calls it Contextual Compression, and the RECOMP paper calls it Extractive Compression [https://twitte
r.com/manelferreira\_/status/1713214439715938528](https://twitter.com/manelferreira_/status/1713214439715938528)

Thinki
ng about how best to do this, I realized it is **highly inefficient** to simply ask the LLM to 'parrot' out relevant por
tions of the text: this is obviously slow, and also consumes valuable token generation space and can cause you to bump i
nto context-length limits (and of course is expensive, e.g. for gpt4 we know generation is 6c/1k tokens vs input cost of
 3c/1k tokens).

I realized the best way (or at least a good way) to do this is to **number** the sentences and have the
 LLM simply spit out the relevant sentence **numbers.** Langroid's unique Multi-Agent + function-calling architecture al
lows an elegant implementation of this, in the RelevanceExtractorAgent ([https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/
langroid/agent/special/relevance\_extractor\_agent.py](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/langroid/agent/spe
cial/relevance_extractor_agent.py)).  The agent annotates the docs with sentence numbers, and instructs the LLM to pick 
out the **sentence-numbers** relevant to the query, rather than whole sentences using a function-call (SegmentExtractToo
l [https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/langroid/agent/tools/segment\_extract\_tool.py](https://github.com/lan
groid/langroid/blob/main/langroid/agent/tools/segment_extract_tool.py)), and the agent's function-handler interprets thi
s message and strips out the indicated sentences by their numbers. To extract from a set of passages, langroid automatic
ally does this async + concurrently so latencies in practice are much, much lower than the sentence-parroting approach.


\[FD -- I am the lead dev of Langroid - [https://github.com/langroid/langroid](https://github.com/langroid/langroid))


I thought this **numbering** idea is a fairly obvious idea in theory, so I looked at LangChain's equivalent `LLMChainExt
ractor` (they call this Contextual Compression [https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data\_connection/retrievers/co
ntextual\_compression?ref=blog.langchain.dev](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/conte
xtual_compression?ref=blog.langchain.dev)) and was surprised to see it is the simple '**parrot**' method, i.e. the LLM w
rites out whole sentences verbatim from its input. I thought it would be interesting to compare Langroid vs LangChain, y
ou can see it in this Colab: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RDPCR2xNuBffcmpUuPIXYDRG3SXIJC5F](https://colab.r
esearch.google.com/drive/1RDPCR2xNuBffcmpUuPIXYDRG3SXIJC5F)

On the specific example in the notebook, the Langroid **num
bering** approach is 22x faster and 36% cheaper (with gpt4) than LangChain's **parrot** method (I promise this name is *
not* inspired by their logo :). See table below.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I won
der if anyone had thoughts on relevance extraction, or other approaches. At the very least, I hope langroid's implementa
tion is useful to you -- you can use the `DocChatAgent.get_verbatim_extracts()` ([https://github.com/langroid/langroid/b
lob/main/langroid/agent/special/doc\_chat\_agent.py#L804](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/langroid/agent/

system or not.

MachineLearning -  [ [R] Model Troubles ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/17ikh2u/r_model_troubles/) , 2023-11-25-0909
```
So i‚Äôm working on a model that diagnoses alzheimer‚Äôs disease and suggests medication depending on how severe the symptom
s might have become 
I‚Äôm using the Openai API and Langchain.

But it‚Äôs dumb and it doesn‚Äôt learn (
Me: I forgot my keys 
at home
Model: Yup, Alzheimer‚Äôs)
How do i incorporate the actual machine learning

Edit: I didn‚Äôt choose this project my
 supervisor did and she barely knows anything about the topic or how to approach it
