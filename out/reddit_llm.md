it asks the clarification question but the sql agent still continues to run. The clar

 it just shows the clarification question. and i have to then retype it again. 

Is there a better way to do this? maybe
 something like 

clarifying llm | agent_executor | output ? 

how would this work in streamlit? 

Any help is greatly a
ppreciated.

Hey everyone,

I wanted to share what I built with this community to see what you guys think. I'm curious about any use 
cases you might have or just general feedback.

I created TradDocs with a simple mission: to make document extraction as
 painless as possible. I know firsthand how much time and effort can go into pre-training and labeling, and I wanted to 
build a tool that lets you focus on what really matters -> building and coding.

With TradDocs, you can:

* Extract data
 from any document types with minimal setup.
* Customize the JSON format you receive as a response.
* Save loads of time
 on tedious pre-training tasks.

Check out our beta here: [https://www.traddocs.com](https://www.traddocs.com/).

For th
ose who prefer not to click on unknown links, here’s our YouTube demo video: https://youtu.be/LdCC0uBQ-QE.

It’s free to
 use during this beta phase. After that, I'm considering pricing it at $0.014 for the splitter and $0.075 for the extrac
tor. I’d love to hear your feedback on this.

Using TradDocs is very simple:

1. Specify the types of documents you'd li
ke to extract.
2. Enter the desired JSON format for the response.
3. Upload your document and receive the data you need!


I’m personally available to answer any questions or help you get started. You can DM me on Reddit or chat with me on D
iscord: https://discord.gg/xgEXkh7Rxk. I’d love to hear what you think and how we can make TradDocs even better.

Hey everyone,  
  
I am working on an info extraction project where I am using LLM's to extract information from the doc
uments. The length of the documents that I am dealing with a rather short (3-5 pages), so I am not using RAG, but provid

ensures a structured response all the time. And this setup used to work for most cases where the information to extract 
where directly present in the document.  
  
Now I have some scenarios where the information that needs to be extracted 
are not directly present in the document. From the content in the document, LLM have to do some reasoning to extract the
 required information. In this case, I am having some trouble in extracting information using function calling.  
  
Any

```
Hi, I wanted to ask if anyone has experienced this issue because between Google, myself, and GPT, we can't find a soluti
on.

I have an endpoint created in FastAPI to which I pass a hash, a username, and a question. It uses a langgraph graph
, queries, embeddings, and more, and through OpenAI using a model, it returns a response. Basically, it's a bot, but spe
cialized since it doesn't respond in general; it responds based on information I have stored in a vector database. So, y
ou ask the question, it transforms it into a vector, searches for the nearest vectors, and returns that as text.

Now, t
he problem:

When the endpoint is called, this process is executed. Essentially, it creates a synchronization with the P
ostgreSQL table of chat history.

This code is in the endpoint. The structure of the API uses routes, so there is a main
 file that imports this endpoint.

    engine_cx_bot = create_engine()
    
    from langchain_google_cloud_sql_pg impor
t PostgresChatMessageHistory
    
    history = PostgresChatMessageHistory.create_sync(
        engine_cx_bot, session_i
d=session_id, table_name=settings.table_cx_history
    )

This allows me to do two things:

1. Insert the new interactio
ns between the human who asks and the bot that responds:



    history.add_message(HumanMessage(content=inputs['questio
n']))
    history.add_message(AIMessage(content=''.join(output['generate_answer']['messages'])))

1. Retrieve the histor
y of all messages so that with each new question from the user, the bot has the context of the conversation. If I ask a 
few questions today and come back tomorrow, when I ask again, since it has all the historical messages, it can continue 
the conversation.

The problem:

I deployed this on Cloud Run, the endpoint works fine, I can hit it from a frontend and
 have a chat with the bot, but after an hour or two, I can no longer hit it due to a 500 status. It seems like the conne
ction between Cloud Run and Cloud SQL, where the data is stored, gets cut off. Looking at the logs, I only see this. I'v
e done approximately 50 deployments trying to test it, and I can't get past this error which is random—sometimes after 1
 hour, sometimes after 2. The longest it took before it failed was 6 hours.

Has anyone
 experienced this? If I go to Cloud Run and redeploy the same revision, it starts working again, but the same thing happ
ens—a few hours later, it fails.

STATUS UPDATE:

I found this on StackOverflow [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/783
07398/long-lived-cloud-sql-python-connector-with-iam-authentication-gives-intermittent](https://stackoverflow.com/questi
ons/78307398/long-lived-cloud-sql-python-connector-with-iam-authentication-gives-intermittent) and it seems to be a prob
lem between the library and how Cloud Run assigns CPU. I'm following the recommended steps and still facing the same iss
ues.

At this very moment, I'm migrating the entire backend to Alloy since I read that in their library version, they su
pposedly fixed the problem by adding lazy loading.

```
Hi Group,

I made a post with my buddy Daniel Warfield breaking down why parsing matters so much for RAG and comparing s
ome of the different approaches based on our experience working with Air France, Dartmouth a big online publisher and do
zens of other projects with real data

For full transparency, one of the products discussed comes from my firm [EyeLevel
.ai](http://EyeLevel.ai), but that's not the focus. It's a discussion of how we can all build better RAG on the kind of 
complex docs we see in the real world.

You can watch it on YT if you prefer... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vv64f1
yI0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vv64f1yI0I)

# The Foundation of RAG: Document Parsing

Let's start with a fundam
ental truth: parsing is the bedrock of any RAG application. 

'The first step in any RAG application is parsing your doc
ument and extracting the information from it,' says EyeLevel cofounder Neil Katz. 'You’re trying to turn it into somethi
ng that language models will eventually understand and do something smart with.'

This isn't just about extracting text.
 It's about preserving structure, context, and relationships within the data. Get this wrong, and your entire RAG pipeli
ne suffers. If you don't get the information out of your giant set of documents in the first place, which is often where
 RAG starts, it's “garbage in and garbage out” and nothing else will work properly.

# The Heart of the Problem

The bas
ic problem to solve is that language models, at least for now, don't understand complex visual documents. Anything with 
tables, forms, graphics, charts, figures and complex formatting will cause downstream hallucinations in a RAG applicatio
n. Yes you can take a page from a PDF and feed it into ChatGPT and it will understand some of it, sometimes most of it. 
But try doing this at scale with thousands or millions of pages and you've got a mess and eventually downstream hallucin
ations for your RAG.

So devs need some way of breaking complex documents apart, identifying the text blocks, the tables
, the charts and so on, then extracting the information from those positions and converting it into something language m
odels will understand and that you can store in your RAG database. This final output is usually simple text or JSON.

Th
is problem isn't new btw. There are entire industries devoted to ingesting medical bills, restaurant receipts and so on.
 That's typically done with a vision model fine tuned to a very specific set of documents. The model for receipts isn't 
good at medical bills. And vice versa.

The new twist is RAG often deals with a highly varied set of content. A legal RA
G, for example, might need to understand police reports, medical bills and insurance claims.  The second twist is the in
formation needs to be converted into LLM ready data.

So let's talk about what's out there.

# Parsing Strategies: Break
down of Approaches

Let's examine some common parsing strategies, their strengths, and their limitations using an exampl
e of a medical document showcasing exam dates and fees in a table:

# 1. PyPDF

[Image: PyPDF results showing minimal in
formation extracted from the table in the medical document.](https://preview.redd.it/lizhsf8twgfd1.png?width=960&format=
png&auto=webp&s=f8a3fe90f3725c9751fd370dc885fa7d4a4f147b)

[PyPDF](https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is
 a longstanding Python library designed for reading and manipulating PDF files. It can be effective for basic text extra
ction from simple PDFs, but often struggles with complex layouts, tables, and formatted text. 

PyPDF is best suited for
 straightforward, text-heavy documents but may lose critical structural information in more intricate PDFs. It doesn't p
rocess visual objects like images, charts, graphs and figures.

# 2. Tesseract (OCR)

[Image: Tesseract results showing 
information extracted from the table in the medical document.](https://preview.redd.it/ofa0pkawwgfd1.png?width=960&forma
t=png&auto=webp&s=a9a47fa3defa74939b453236fec4aee0de6dfea4)

[Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) is 
an open-source optical character recognition (OCR) engine that can extract text from images and scanned documents. Best 
known for converting image-based text to machine-readable format, Tesseract can struggle with maintaining document struc
ture, especially in complex layouts or tables. 

It's particularly useful for scanned documents but may require addition
al post-processing to preserve formatting and structure. Tesseract also doesn't process visual objects like images, char
ts, graphs and figures.

# 3. Unstructured

[Image: Unstructured results showing rich information extracted from the tab
le in the medical document.](https://preview.redd.it/yz8gnwvzwgfd1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=a39380072b5beb48
547179c463489bd5353ca14d)

[Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/) is a modern document parsing library that aims to ha
ndle a wide variety of document types and formats. It employs a combination of techniques to extract and structure infor
mation from documents, including text extraction, table detection, and layout analysis. 

While more robust than traditi
onal parsing tools, Unstructured can still face challenges with highly complex or non-standard document formats. Like th
e others, it doesn't process visual objects like images, charts, graphs and figures.

# 4. LlamaParse

[Image: LlamaPars
e results showing a markdown table of information extracted from the table in the medical document.](https://preview.red
d.it/8ev781z1xgfd1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=2db69039e0567ebe6efb69be07aff2ffec71437e)

[LlamaParse](https://
docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/llama_cloud/llama_parse/) is a newer parsing solution developed by the team behind [LlamaIn
dex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/). It's designed to handle complex document structures, including tables and formatted te
xt, and outputs results in a markdown format that's easily interpretable by language models. 

It has been seen to prese
rve document structure and handle tables, though it's a relatively new tool and its full capabilities and limitations ar
e still being explored in real-world applications.

# 5. X-Ray by [**EyeLevel.ai**](http://EyeLevel.ai)

[Image: X-Ray b
y EyeLevel.ai converts a complex medical bill into clean JSON chunks with both narrative description and data that LLMs 
prefer](https://preview.redd.it/a14hfii3xgfd1.png?width=1942&format=png&auto=webp&s=37c7ae239e136201836e3fb44ec33331cf7a
92d7)

[X-Ray](https://www.eyelevel.ai/xray), powered by EyeLevel’s [GroundX APIs](https://www.eyelevel.ai/product/apis)
, takes a multimodal approach to parsing with industry leading results, especially when parsing complex visuals includin
g charts, graphics and figures. X-Ray is far more than just a table parser.

The X-Ray technology starts with a fine-tun
ed vision model trained on a million pages of enterprise documents from a wide cross section of industries including hea
lth, financial, insurance, legal and government. The system uses the vision model to identify various objects on the pag
e: text blocks, tables, charts and so on. Once the coordinates are known, it extracts the information, chunks it and sen
ds it to different pipelines to be turned into LLM ready data.

The result is a JSON-like output that includes the core 
data, chunk summary, doc summary, keywords and other metadata, providing richer context for language models. X-Ray is av
ailable in a demo format for developers to try for themselves, where they can upload a document to the system and see th
e semantic objects that are created to translate complex visuals to the LLM. [**You can try X-Ray here**](https://www.ey
elevel.ai/xray).

# Performance Impact: The Parsing Difference

Our tests, along with academic research, show that parsi
ng strategy can significantly impact RAG performance. 

We're talking about substantial gains, as Daniel Warfield, co-ho
st of RAG Masters points out:

>'For some examples, there's a 10%, even a 20% difference in performance.'

This is cruci
al when you consider the effort that goes into other optimization strategies:

>'People are doing crazy advanced strateg
ies for the difference in 5, 6, 7, even 10 percent performance. And then maybe just completely switching the parser migh
t get you a massive performance increase.'

# Error Analysis: Common Parsing Pitfalls

Let's examine some common parsing
 errors and their downstream effects:

1. **Table Misinterpretation:** When parsers fail to correctly identify table str
uctures, it can lead to data being treated as unstructured text. This can result in incorrect answers in question-answer
ing tasks, especially for queries about tabular data.
2. **Loss of Formatting:** If a document structure isn't well unde
rstood, a text scrape could scramble the pieces up. A header could wind up in body copy. A column label could wind up in
 the rows of data. You get the parsing equivalent of scrambled eggs.
3. **Image Handling:** Most parsers struggle with e
mbedded images or diagrams, either ignoring them completely or misinterpreting them as text through OCR.
4. **Header/Foo
ter Confusion:** Parsers might incorrectly include headers and footers as part of the main content, potentially skewing 
the context of the extracted information.

# Developing Custom Parsing Strategies

For developers dealing with specific 
document types or domains, developing custom parsing strategies can be beneficial. Here are some approaches:

1. **Combi
ning Existing Tools:** Use multiple parsing tools in tandem, leveraging the strengths of each for different parts of you
r documents.
2. **Regular Expressions:** Implement custom regex patterns to extract specific types of information consis
tently found in your documents.
3. **Domain-Specific Rules:** Incorporate rules based on domain knowledge to improve par
sing accuracy for specialized documents.
4. **Machine Learning Augmentation:** Train models to recognize and extract spe
cific patterns or structures in your documents.

# Integration Challenges

When integrating parsing strategies into exis
ting RAG pipelines, developers often face several challenges:

1. **API Compatibility:** Ensure that the chosen parsing 
strategy can be easily integrated with your existing codebase and infrastructure.
2. **Data Format Consistency:** The ou
tput of your parser should be in a format that's compatible with the rest of your RAG pipeline, often requiring addition
al preprocessing steps.
3. **Scalability:** Consider the computational resources required by different parsing strategie
s, especially when dealing with large document sets.
4. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to deal with
 parsing failures or unexpected document formats.

# Best Practices for Selecting a Parsing Strategy

It’s recommend to 
take a two-pronged approach to selecting the right parsing strategy:

**1. Visual Inspection:** Start by running your do
cuments through different parsers and examining the output. As Warfield advises:

>'Pass your data through a bunch of pa
rsers and look at them. Your brain is still the most powerful model that exists.'

**2. End-to-End Testing:** Once you'v
e narrowed down your options, conduct thorough end-to-end testing. This means running your entire RAG pipeline with diff
erent parsing strategies and evaluating the final output.

To quantitatively compare parsing strategies, consider the fo
llowing metrics:

* Accuracy in table and graphical extraction
* Preservation of document structure
* Abiliity to turn e
xtractions into LLM friendly data
* Speed of parsing
* Consistency across different document types
* Ability to handle c
omplex formatting

# The Challenge of Evaluation

Here's the rub: evaluating parsing quality is still a largely manual p
rocess. Creating question-answer pairs for evaluation is labor-intensive but crucial for building automated tooling. The
 need for human evaluation in parsing cannot be completely eliminated, at least not yet.

This presents a significant op
portunity in the field, and this post will be updated in the future when a sufficiently advanced solution for automated 
parsing is discovered.

# Conclusion

As we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with RAG applications, it
's clear that document parsing will remain a critical component. The field is ripe for innovation, particularly in parsi
ng technology and evaluation methods.

For developers building RAG applications, it’s critical not to overlook the impor
tance of parsing. Take the time to evaluate different parsing strategies and their impact on your specific use case. It 
could be the difference between a RAG system that merely functions and one that excels.

Remember, in the world of RAG, 
your system is only as good as the data you feed it. And that all starts with parsing.

```
Hi everyone! I'm currently experimenting with RAG. I was very successful implementing a simple prototype and now I'm loo
king to improve and productionise this. It's based on allow general questions on news articles from several sources. My 
challenge is how to handle general questions like 'show me all topics' or 'what is the sentiment towards X'. In order to
 do this, I assume the model should be aware of full context, which is not viable as the dataset has millions of article
s from several years. Any advice where to start tackling this ? Tried to find some resources, but I couldn't, probably d
ue to lack of understanding how to 'name' this problem

I was hoping to build a a bot which will take question from client and get response back. The thing is that, client can 
ask anything. And the consistency and stability an enterprise grade application should have is not there no matter what.
 I have put so much effort and its still not as expected. Have any one of you figured it out?

# Seeking advice on developing a Discord bot with LangChain

Hello Discord bot developers! I'm working on a Discord bot 
project using LangChain and would love to get some advice and insights.

My project aims to integrate the following feat
ures:

* AI-powered conversations (using LLMs and LangChain)
* Music playback
* Multi-modal capabilities (visual Q&A and
 image generation)
* Utility tools (reminders, recommendations, calculations, etc.)
* User data management
* Context-awa
re responses based on channel history (RAG)

The tech stack includes:
Python 3.10+, Discord.py, MongoDB, Lavalink, LangC
hain

I'm particularly interested in hearing from the community on these questions:

1. Has anyone fully implemented a D
iscord bot using LangChain? What was your experience like?
2. How have you optimized RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation
) in your Discord bots?
3. What LangChain-specific features would you like to see in a Discord bot?

I've started an ope
n-source project to explore these ideas. If you're interested in viewing the code or contributing, let me know, and I ca
n provide the GitHub link in the comments.

Let's discuss these topics! Your insights could help shape the future of thi
s project.

```
Ok am I crazy or do the docs and examples show multiple ways of doing the same thing. As a noobie it's confusing as hell
 and slowly me down. Yeah skill issue, i'm just a web dev hobbyist venturing into the world of agentic flows. 

Let's ta
ke creating a tool.

* You can use the \`tool\` method
* You can use \`new DynamicStructuredTool \`
* You can use \`new 
DynamicTool\`

I get that there's nuances between when to use which, but the docs and examples end up using different im
plementations through the docs which is super confusing. And bouncing between examples I feel like I have to pay attenti
on more carefully for these different implementations to make sure they don't throw me off back to looking at the docs (
which are not easy to navigate). 

  
If you're going to switch something on the user mid way through an example, please
 show a comment what the alternative way is and stick the the original way you started with.

I feel like this happens a
ll over the place. A simple example is the use of \`new HumanMessage\` and just using \`\[user, query\]\`. 

These examp
le end up importing way too much stuff that's not necessary. What's the point of the Message helpers anyways? Are we exp
ecting the convention to change of working with system, assistant, and user messages? The whole point of typescript is t
hat we would get type safety for these values. Anyways I'll end my slight rant here

  
People online complain about LC.
 I see its value, but it feels like trying to drive a stick shift car, except you have two stick shifts to use but you'r
e wondering why there are two of them and not one...

**
Background:**

I'm applying to AI Engineer and Data Scientist jobs, I want to work with LLMs and cutting-edge AI.

I did
 had interviews (using my old CV), but I think he reflected ML more then LLMs which is my real speciallity. So I got man
y denials from relevant jobs and decided to edit it. (It made by resume writer who did terrible job IMO)

I created new 
CV yesterday and decided to post it in reddit (not in this 'r/') ppl said it have too much information and refered me he
re where I found the wiki and more useful material.

Just done making my new CV.

**About skill section:**

* Programmin
g Languages:
   * I'm familiar but no work exp with Java and JavaScript (and I see it in many jobs) should it get in the
re?
* Deep learning:
   * Should I say Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning or PEFT, or Low-Rank Adaptation or LoRA most Job 
descriptions request PEFT or LoRA?
   * should I include supervised fine-tuning?
   * Should I include Hugging face? (Tr
anspormers library) same with openai vs OpenAI API
* Machine learning:
   * should I include OpenCV? (lower efficiency b
ut familiar with)
   * Also XGBoost, familiar with it but see it in a lot of jobs
* Artificial intellegence:
   * should
 I include key NLP libraries like spaCy, NLTK, and Stanza (or StanfordNLP)?
   * I did Include prompt Engineering, LangC
hain but should I also Include LangSmith? (high demmand, maybe even CoT?)
   * Also removed some important key concepts 
like Word Embeddings ,Text Embeddings, Text Cleaning, Tokenizers, Text Similarity, Text Generation, Text Classification,
 etc.

**About Experiance:**

* AI Engineer:
   * I feel like it still might be too long sentences, should I break somet
hing into 2 sentences?
* The Other 2 Jobs:
   * TBH I didnt really knew what to type in result since I left the research
 when I found a job.

**About Projects:**

* Its actually projects that I've done in my last year in the degree but some
 hiring managers, especially from Cyber security was interested in my Ransomware.

**About Education:**

* The way I wro
te my GPA is ok? (I will change to 3.8 if I apply US)

**References to past resumes and desired Jobs:**

* My old CV whi
ch got me some interviews:

new CV yesterday and decided to post it in reddit (not in this 'r/') ppl said it have too much information and refered m
e here where I found the wiki and more useful material.
* Just done making my new CV.

**About skill section:**

* Progr
amming Languages:
   * I'm familiar but no work exp with Java and JavaScript (and I see it in many jobs) should it get i
n there?
* Deep learning:
   * Should I say Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning or PEFT, or Low-Rank Adaptation or LoRA most
 Job descriptions request PEFT or LoRA?
   * should I include supervised fine-tuning?
   * Should I include Hugging face
? (Transpormers library) same with openai vs OpenAI API
* Machine learning:
   * should I include OpenCV? (lower efficie
ncy but familiar with)
   * Also XGBoost, familiar with it but see it in a lot of jobs
* Artificial intellegence:
   * s
hould I include key NLP libraries like spaCy, NLTK, and Stanza (or StanfordNLP)?
   * I did Include prompt Engineering, 
LangChain but should I also Include LangSmith? (high demmand, maybe even CoT?)
   * Also removed some important key conc
epts like Word Embeddings ,Text Embeddings, Text Cleaning, Tokenizers, Text Similarity, Text Generation, Text Classifica
tion, etc.

**About Experiance:**

* AI Engineer:
   * I feel like it still might be too long sentences, should I break 
something into 2 sentences?
* The Other 2 Jobs:
   * TBH I didnt really knew what to type in result since I left the res
earch when I found a job.

**About Projects:**

* Its actually projects that I've done in my last year in the degree but
 some hiring managers, especially from Cyber security was interested in my Ransomware.

**About Education:**

* The way 
I wrote my GPA is ok? (I will change to 3.8 if I apply US)

**References to past resumes and desired Jobs:**

* My old C
V which got me some interviews:

all -  [ GenAi Analytics Agent ](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1eeifu5/genai_analytics_agent/) , 2024-07-30-0911
```
I'm in the process of building an Ai Analytics agent using OpenAI, Langchain and Streamlit. I could use some feedback on
 my current set up and was hoping some of you might be able to give me some tips.

The Goal:
So the goal is to provide t
he use with charts and graphs of data that is stored in our semantic layer on Snowflake. 

The Data:
We are fortunate en
ough to have descriptions for every column and naming conventions for columns used in joins. I have created embeddings f
or all the table names and column descriptions and have put these behind an API that can use a semantic similarity searc
h.

The Agent:
I built some functions that can call the API endpoints to get either relevant table names or column names
. I then added a function that can fetch a table schema, one that can fetch the data from specified columns from snowfla
ke and one more that can filter the data using pandas. I have provided all these functions as tools to a Langchain agent
 with a manually written prompt with some guidelines on how to use the tools.

This set up has given mixed results. When
 it gets the right table name it can work like a charm, but it still struggles sometimes. For instance when a user is lo
oking for revenue per week it puts daily sales into the search query, or it searches on the article level instead of per
 store. Sometimes it also looks up the schema of every table to find the right one, using up a lot of tokens.

I feel li
ke I'm moving in the right direction, but I wonder if there are maybe best practices I'm missing, causing me to use to m
any tokens. Furthermore I hear a lot about people using techniques like DSPy, Knowledge Graph and fine tuning, but I'm n
ot sure whether these would offer (significant) benefits in my case.

Any help/feedback on my approach would be much app
reciated!

```
Hey folks,

I’ve been looking into GPT4o tool calling feature for my project and came to conclusion that its architectur
e can be quite inefficient in costs (not very surprising). 

Every time I want to use a tool, I have to re-send the enti
re chat history—system prompts, user messages, tool calls, and pratically everything. This means I’m paying for those ex
tra tokens all over again, which can add up quickly if my prompt is 4000 tokens long.

I get that this is for privacy re
asons, but it’s definitely not the most cost-friendly. Has anyone else dealt with this? How are you handling it? Any tip
s to make this less of a hassle or to keep the costs down?

I need it just for 'calculator tool' that will enable GPT4o 
to make adjustments to various numeric data in a determinstic way..

Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions!


Thanks!

I recently obtained the Microsoft AI Engineer certification (AI-102) with the aim of finding a job in the AI ​​field in 
France. I do not master English, especially speech. Unfortunately, I discovered there is no demand for this certificatio

all -  [ Optimize Agentic Workflow Cost and Performance: A reversed engineering approach ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1ee3ly6/optimize_agentic_workflow_cost_and_performance_a/) , 2024-07-30-0911
```
https://preview.redd.it/8ifdm442v7fd1.png?width=1492&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2b7c1b3391d17d940dc36705f2a9407c822df73

Th
ere are two primary approaches to getting started with Agentic workflows: **workflow automation** for domain experts and
 **autonomous agents** for resource-constrained projects. By observing how agents perform tasks successfully, you can ma
p out and optimize workflow steps, reducing hallucinations, costs, and improving performance.

Let's explore how to auto
mate the “Dependencies Upgrade” for your product team using CrewAI then Langgraph. Typically, a software engineer would 
handle this task by visiting changelog webpages, reviewing changes, and coordinating with the product manager to create 
backlog stories. With agentic workflow, we can streamline and automate these processes, saving time and effort while all
owing engineers to focus on more engaging work.

  
For demonstration, [source-code is available on Github](https://gith
ub.com/AgiFlow/repo-upgrade).

For detailed explanation, please see below videos:

[Part 1: Get started with Autonomous 
Agents using CrewAI](https://youtu.be/hvcd8Xjpd7A) 

[Part 2: Optimisation with Langgraph and Conclusion](https://youtu.
be/_k82vx4qaLo)

# Short summary on the repo and videos

With **autononous agents** first approach, we would want to fol
low below steps:

# 1. Keep it Simple, Stupid

https://preview.redd.it/zj4hcm8bv7fd1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp
&s=caa379e7735b139916444e359c9630bd2a9a9419

We start with two agents: a Product Manager and a Developer, utilizing the 
Hierarchical Agents process from CrewAI. The Product Manager orchestrates tasks and delegates them to the Developer, who
 uses tools to fetch changelogs and read repository files to determine if dependencies need updating. The Product Manage
r then prioritizes backlog stories based on these findings.

Our goal is to analyse the successful workflow execution on
ly to learn the flow at the first step.

# 2. Simplify Communication Flow

Autonomous Agents are great for some scenario
s, but not for workflow automation. We want to reduce the cost, hallucination and improve speed from Hierarchical proces
s.

Second step is to reduce unnecessary communication from bi-directional to uni-directional between agents. Simply tal
k, have specialised agent to perform its task, finish the task and pass the result to the next agent without repetition 
(liked Manufactoring process).

ae4177a3b079d5b234f32adfd5a8

# 3. Prompt optimisation

ReAct Agent are great for auto-correct action, but also cause un
predictability in automation jobs which increase number of LLM calls and repeat actions.

If predictability, cost and sp
eed is what you are aiming for, you can also optimise prompt and explicitly flow engineer with Langgraph. Also make sure
 the context you pass to prompt doesn't have redundant information to control the cost.

  
A summary from above steps; 
the techniques in Blue box are low hanging fruits to improve your workflow. If you want to use other techniques, ensure 
you have these components implemented first: evaluation, observability and human-in-the-loop feedback.

Langchain, Llamaindex, CrewAPI are all good libraries and frameworks, but you might not need them always. For simple app
s, these frameworks just overly-complicate stuff. Here's how I built a genAI app that uses gemini to answer based on CSV

all -  [ How can I stream only the final result from a agent in streamlit  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1eduao5/how_can_i_stream_only_the_final_result_from_a/) , 2024-07-30-0911
```
Sorry if this question is too basic. New to this so trying to learn. 



So this Is what I did. Created a basic agent wi
th few random tools. Added Memory to it using RunnableWithMessageHistory. 



`llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name = 'gpt-3.5-tu
rbo', temperature = 0)`

`tools = [click_new_image, visual_question_answer, question_answer, previous_pic]`

`prompt = C
hatPromptTemplate.from_messages(`

`[`

`('system', 'You are a very powerful assistant who can take pictures and answer 
questions about them. If the query is regarding an older pic, then answer directly instead of taking a new pic.'),`

`Me
ssagesPlaceholder(variable_name='history'),`

`('user', '{input}'),`

`MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name='agent_scratchp
ad'),`

`]`

`)`

`agent = create_tool_calling_agent(llm, tools, prompt)`

`agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, 
tools=tools, verbose = True)`

`store = {}`

  
`agent_executor_w_memory = RunnableWithMessageHistory(`

`agent_executor
,`

`get_session_history,`

`input_messages_key='input',`

`history_messages_key='history',`

`)`

  
To run this I did 
( In Streamlit ) - 

`if prompt := st.chat_input():`

`st.chat_message('user').write(prompt)`

`with st.chat_message('as
sistant'):`

`response = agent_executor_w_memory.invoke(`

`{'input': prompt},`

`config=config,`

`)`

`st.write(respon
se['output'])`

  
But this won't stream( typing effect) the output, it will just give the final output at once. I want 
to stream the output. Only the last response, not the intermediate steps. 

  
Ps- Can I also stream the intermediate st
ep result( we could iterate through the stream and print chunks but that will also not stream( typing effect)) ? or like
 tools it call too? ( Asking just to learn more, not needed as of now)

all -  [ ML model demo tool?  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1edtzrx/ml_model_demo_tool/) , 2024-07-30-0911
```
Hey guys,

My buddy and I are working on a tool that lets you preview your ML models in a presentable environment before
 deployment. I had my models set up on Google Colab, but it wasn’t easy for the team to review it. It also isn’t very pr
esentable to clients.

So we want to create a demo environment that’s super simple to share and present models before ha
nding off to devops. Thinking about adding some sort of feedback system too.

We’re still figuring out the details, so w
e’d love to get your takes on this. In your experience, what features would’ve helped you? Currently we have charts and 
collaboration features in mind.

Thanks! (my dm is open! we can’t be the only ones having this problem right)

all -  [ Lack of APIs ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1edkn7p/lack_of_apis/) , 2024-07-30-0911
```
Hey guys,

I have a general question for those of you developing agentic AI systems. Have you had the problem of a servi
ce not having an API and how did you solve it (i.e., how did you define the 'tool' to be used by the LLM)? A simple exam
ple: I want my personal AI assistant to purchase groceries for me, but there's no API provided by the supermarket. How c
an I achieve that?

  
Do you think this is another reason why AI agents are still not in use for tasks that are not cri
tical (thus, it's fine if they're not 100% reliable), but could be very useful in our daily lives?


Edit: by “simple ex
ample”, I meant “simple use case”, not that it’s easy to implement

For those building production RAG pipelines, how are you generating embeddings. More than which model, I'm interested 
in how your deploying it. Are you calling the openai/vertex API endpoint directly? Using langchain/llamaindex wrappers? 
Using vectordb  classes? Or some other way?

We completely underestimated this one tbh, thought it would be much more straight forward. But we've done it now and doc
umented how step by step [in this article series](https://medium.com/p/5828a1ea43a3).

A bit of context, we're building 
a mini free AI Agent that auto-generates manually customisable plots, so the user can basically style however they want.
 It needs to be cost effective and efficient, so we thought about how to do it and tested a couple other ways.

We plan on 
releasing the project open source, so all feedback welcome! Is anyone else doing this and has any feedback? or do know o
f a better way to do it?
