```
Hi, I have a chatbot that consists of a basic graph where I have a node that calls that LLM and another node that execut
es the tools.  
But I need the user to authorize the execution of the tool first. For this, I need to show the user the 
tool that is about to execute and its arguments, the user can then read what the agent is about to do and could change t
he tool or one of the args by giving feedback. However, all of the information that is shown so that the user can accept
 it needs to be in a user-friendly way. Does anyone know how to do this?

Hello everyone,

I am a recent graduate joining in the pool of full time job seekers.

Background: I am 26 years old, in
ternational student, looking to break into the data field in US. While my masters is Mechanical Engineering on paper, I 
took up courses and projects in the ML and AI domain. My thesis is in Computer Vision, nothing ground-breaking, but a go
od project using Segmentation.

My 'Data Scientist' experience is a part time program in my university which collaborate
s with a large pharma industry, where I worked and gained a lot of knowledge/experience in the Data Science area.

I nee
d an opinion on my resume and the blunders it contains (if any), and the things that I can improve. I also hope I have s
howcased my skills and expeience in the best manner possible, despite coming from a mechanical background. If not, pleas
e let me know your thoughts.

Thanks for your time.

```
For my job, I write hundreds of proposals for government contracts. I want to use an OpenAI API to build a tool that loo
ks over a database of previous proposals (csv, txt, etc.), takes in a single proposal request, and outputs a response fo
r that request. Most of these proposals are around 100 pages and I would like to to output a proposal that is \~70 pages
. For context, I have some basic python experience, but I am unsure of exactly how to go about this. Some forums that I 
read suggested that I use langchain to comb through super long text files. My long term goal is to build a simple GUI an
d dashboard to make it accessible to others in my company and online. How should I go about this? Also, which LLM model 
should I use? Thanks!

I'm curious if any how has looked at applying agents to problems with deterministic but non-exhaustive answers? My use c
ase is around planning/estimation for repair processes(boats, cars, planes, etc). Similar to the idea [making a sandwich
 from scratch](https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/17/9344597/man-spent-six-months-1500-making-sandwich-from-scratch), there
 might be always another layer of granularity you could expand to. Has anyone worked on a similar use case where a core 
task of an agent is reasoning/judging if an answer is 'good enough/complete enough'?

```
Hi, these are two questions bundled into one.  
I'm supposed to create an LLM that gives users suggestions on the projec
t they are working.  
I'm also supposed to add a feedback loop that can improve the model response over time.  
  
So I 
can't just change the LLM model iteratively because I will be using an LLM through api.  
I figured that I could change 
the data I passed to the llm as context through RAG.  
That's when GPT suggested using neo4j's GraphRAG as we can change
 the weights of the data connections and also trace the part of the data we find faulty easily.  
  
This is what it sai
d  
  
After the AI provides a suggestion, monitor its effectiveness. If users frequently make certain changes or follow
 specific advice, reinforce those connections in your system, making them more prominent in future predictions. This cou
ld involve revisiting and adjusting the strength of connections within your knowledge graph. Use RL algorithms like Q-le
arning or policy gradients to adjust the weights

  
I'm new to Graph databases and RL and I'm wondering how to proceed.
 If so can you please provide suggestions/resources on how to implement the two or any better alternative to this method
?

I graduate with my MS

Hi,

I want to load my reranking models faster, e.g. with an API.

I am using HuggingfaceEmbeddings with:

    HuggingFa
ceInferenceAPIEmbeddings

I am also using a reranking model which I am loading like this: 

    from sentence_transforme
rs import CrossEncoder
    
    reranking_model = CrossEncoder('BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3', max_length=512, device='mps')

    
    query = 'Ich liebe Fußball'
    
    page_contents = [
        'Hallo wer bist du',
        'Fußball is so geil
 ey',
        'Fußball ist der coolste Sport',
        'Hamburg liegt in Deutschland',
        ]
    re_res = reranking_
model.rank(query=query, documents=page_contents, return_documents=True, top_k=2)
    #[{'corpus_id': 1, 'score': 0.89757
94, 'text': 'Fußball is so geil ey'},
     #{'corpus_id': 2, 'score': 0.2194788, 'text': 'Fußball ist der coolste Sport'
}]

This works fine on my Mac, however when loading it in a docker it takes ages to build as the 'mps' device is not ava
ilable. 

  
So is anyone aware of a Sentece Transformers Inference API like the HuggingfaceInferenceAPIEmbeddings? Or c
an I rerank the docs the HuggingfaceInferenceAPIEmbeddings class?

Hi everyone, I am working on a Code Assistant project. The goal is to create a code assistant specific to a library, for
 example Pandas(Just an example). There are a lot of codes available online which I could use by scraping and using it a
s the training dataset. The problem arises with the different versions. With new versions, some functions deprecate. So 
our current code assistants trained on old data, couldn't pick this up. I want to make a Code Assistant, which could lea
rn from the documentations, function signatures and understand which version of library we're using. Ideally I want the 
Code Assistant to pickup the version of library in the environment, then write code based on it. 

For this, I am curren
tly generating synthetic data by making a template functions and prompts and generate variations using a LLM. But this i
s not a good way, as I have to manually implement each function test case and it's prompt template. I am looking for a b
etter way to do this.

I am building a chatbot based on langchain with OpenAI as provider for my embeddings and GPT 4O for the LLM, I would lik
e to have a layer of security for my application that is extensible and integrates well with langchain, One such package
 is [LLM-Guard](https://llm-guard.com) from [protect.ai](https://protect.ai). It allows us to individually check the pro
mpt before it touches the langchain logic, which is great and has a lot of features as well. It is all well and good for
 a single request but the processing for subsequent requests is very slow, every time a query is validated the models ar
e loaded into the memory and immediately flushed out as well, this adds a lot of latency when processing multiple reques
ts, is there any way to overcome this issue in LLM Guard. Are there any other packages that would serve a similar functi
onality to add a Security Layer

I know this will vary between use cases and depend on a host of factors, but folks, what are the parameters that y'all u
se in your production RAG app?

I'll go first.

* use case: company's internal knowledge management chatbot
* top k = 5

* chunk size & overlap = 2000 & 200 using Recursive Text Splitter

Obviously, these are just a few of the many parameter
s in a RAG app, so feel free to provide other parameters or information about your use case.

all -  [ better data retrieval under RAG mode ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1evtt98/better_data_retrieval_under_rag_mode/) , 2024-08-20-0911
```
I am currently trying to build a chatbot that could generate test cases for products. my idea now is to feed it some man
-made test cases and product spec for certain devices and ask the LLM to reference them and generate test cases for some
 other devices. 

I have fed some Json structured test cases (as it is originally table formatted) and the product spec 
(in pure text format). At first, if there's only Json data in the vectorstore, the retrieved data is pretty accurate. Ho
wever, after adding the text data as well, it tends to retrieve more text data than json data, even when I am being quit
e specific (for example, if I ask it to give me some cases under certain class, then it might retrieve text for some rea
son, but if be super specific and tell it to search for json data, then it will look for json data.)

I am using FAISS a
s my vectorstore and I did not use any text splitter for json data (as I want to maintain the format). I am quite new to
 the field so any suggestions on how to improve this will be appreciated!  
  
Thanks!

```
I attempted to create a perplexity clone using LangGraph Map Reduce and DuckDuckGo search. One of the issues I faced ear
lier was Serper AI and Tavilly Search API only gave a limited number of credits and hence after a point you had to chang
e to a paid version of these APIs. Also the Free Perplexity used the overall search research and page descriptions to pr
ovide results and not going into the details of the page. This project tries to solve these issues.

Hi everyone,

I'm working on a project where I need to extract experimental data from multiple scientific papers. The da
ta includes details like particle size, temprature, pore sizes, materials used, synthesis conditions, and more. To achie
ve this, I’m planning to use LangChain for extracting the data from PDFs.

Here’s where I need your help:

* **Text Spli
tting:** What’s the best method and optimal size for splitting the text? Since a single PDF might contain data from mult
iple experiments, I want to ensure that I capture each experiment correctly without losing context.
* **Embedding & Retr
ieval:** What are your suggestions for embedding the data and retrieving it later? I’m particularly interested in simila
rity search methods or any other techniques that would improve accuracy in finding and extracting relevant data points.


i'm using llama3.1 70b for this if that matters. also i prefer using open-source/free tools rather that openAi stuff

I
’d really appreciate any tips or advice you can share, especially if you’ve worked on something similar. Thanks in advan
ce!

Hi everyone, I have been developing a customer chatbot for an e-commerce website as a portfolio project to add to my res
ume. With this chatbot, customers will be able to ask their questions about the product, their last purchase and other t
ypes of questions (shipping and payments etc). I decided to use LangGraph's Agents. Adaptive RAG is looking good for thi
s project, but I got confused at some point.

First of all, I have two CSV files to use in RAG. The first one is about t
he technical specification of the products.

And the second one is about the customers (a basic transaction data for eac
h customer).

Should I create 2 different vectorstore or embeed them together in a single vectorstore.

For example when
 I ask the chatbot 'what is technical specification of my last purchased (let's assume an Iphone 15) chatbot should go t
o transaction data and get customers' transaction data and after that go to the technical specification data and respons
e my main question.

When I use a single retreiver for this project chatbot works unstable.

How to be the workflow for 
this project?

I would like your suggestions to improve the project.

s from the RAG should be live from the website. I mean, the website is dynamic. The contents of the website may change t

Good evening,

I'm relatively new to Langchain and Langgraph, and I've build a react agent using Langgraph. I'm passing 
my `prompt` into my `state_modifier` but as I keep adding information to my system prompt, I'm starting to wonder if it'
s clear enough or whether it's getting too long. That's when I thought: can a system prompt be too long? Are the instruc
tions clear enough? For context, I am using gpt-4o-mini as my LLM.

So, apart from asking for some pointers into some re
sources on writing a good system prompt, I'd sincerely appreciate a review of my current prompt below. Pardon my use of 
REDACTED, as I want to maintain a level of anonymity. Additionally, any reference I make to SQL Tools rerfers to the `SQ
LDatabaseToolkit` from the `langchain_community` package.

A RAG has several moving parts: data ingestion, retrieval, re-ranking, generation etc.. Each part comes with numerous op
tions. 

If we consider a toy example, where you could choose from: 



5 different chunking methods,

5 different chunk
 sizes,

5 different embedding models,

5 different retrievers,

5 different re-rankers/ compressors

5 different prompt
s

5 different LLMs



That’s 78,125 distinct RAG configurations! If you could try evaluating each one in just 5 mins, t
hat’d still take 271 days of non-stop trial-and-error effort! In short, it’s kinda impossible to find your optimal RAG s
etup manually.



That’s why we built RAGBuilder - it performs hyperparameter tuning on the RAG parameters (like chunk s
ize, embedding etc.) evaluating multiple configs, and shows you a dashboard where you can see the top performing RAG set
up and the best part is it's Open source!

Our open-source tool, RAGBuilder, now supports AzureOpenAI, GoogleVertex, Gro
q (for Llama 3.1), and Ollama! 🎉 

We also now support Milvus DB, SingleStore, and PG Vector.

Check it out and let us k
now what you think!

```
Hey everyone, I’ve been tasked with creating a chat bot for the company. I’ll be using an LLM that is agentic, supports 
an RAG built off of our knowledge base, and can use custom built tools (calling other API endpoints).  

Does anyone hav
e any recommendations for how this is actually architected?

Would it be a Restful API that communicated with a front en
d UI? I have no clue how to go about this, any help would be much appreciated. If this isn’t the place to talk about the
 deployment or architecture of an AI/ML chatbot please direct me where to go.

Thank you again.

Current tooling:
Python

LLM provider (openAI)
Langchain/Langgraph
FastAPI
K8s

Cheers.

Built a conversational chatbot and want to build frontend for that.

Made backend with - python, langchain, chromaDB, op

MachineLearning -  [ [P] using GPT4o with langchain/chroma for sports analysis  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1enuzlp/p_using_gpt4o_with_langchainchroma_for_sports/) , 2024-08-20-0911
```
Hi all, I'm working on a side project that helps with sports analysis for historical games, which in turn will help with
 sports betting. Currently I've been only focused on MLB because I wanted to see how the use case would pan out.

My fir
st attempt at this was to use the openai endpoint and load all the relevant JSON objects and send a prompt along with th
em to GPT and see what I get back. Eventually, the context size was getting way too big and the problem I was running in
to was that it was expensive. Although, the prompts back were actually pretty decent and relevant to the data.

My secon
d attempt was to setup a RAG using Chroma/LangChain/GPT4o. I got it to work but the answers all seem very off and super 
vague. None of the data I have was shown in any of the prompts i asked, or any of the players that were playing in a gam
e were mentioned at all in the prompt back, plus it kept mentioning wrong games/teams whe asking it specific games. I’m 
assuming I might need to adjust the vector store a bit but not sure how I can do that with chroma.

My question is what 
might be the best way to setup some sort of process? My end result, I would like a response back using the historical da
ta I've provided to make assumptions on what a game could be like based off all the stats given, with some room for GPT 
to also make some inference as well.

I am a super new at this so it's been a learning process so far; please bear with 
me.

For those building production RAG pipelines, how are you generating embeddings. More than which model, I'm interested 
in how your deploying it. Are you calling the openai/vertex API endpoint directly? Using langchain/llamaindex wrappers? 
Using vectordb  classes? Or some other way?

TL;DR: RAG overcomes the limitations of LLMs by bringing in external sources of information as relevant context.  
  

At the end of the step-by-step tutorial, you will be able to give your favorite LLM (ChatGPT, LLAMA 3, Mixtral, Gemini, 
Claude, etc.) some documents, ask it a question and see it respond based on relevant context.  
  
This will be running 
locally, using open-source libraries. Zero API and tooling costs.

deeplearning -  [ Need help with creating CLI for 'non-programmers' (LLMs) ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1elrfgm/need_help_with_creating_cli_for_nonprogrammers/) , 2024-08-20-0911
```
***TL;DR*** What is the best way to convert user input into sequence of commands and their corresponding parameters? Lik
e, imagine you are not a programmer and there is a console app with a CLI, but, well, you don't know the structure and t
he syntax of commands. And you don't want to know. YBut! You have a locally running instance of llama3.1 -- or whatever 
open LLM is out there now -- and you can ask it to create a CLI command for you. What would you do to accomplish that?


**Intro**

A little bit of context. I'm working on a project that targets scientists as end users. It has some UI using 
which it's possible to do all sort of things the lab workers would like to do. But recently the projects product owner d
ecided that it would be cool to have a small chat window that is accessable basically everywhere throughout the applicat
ion UI in which 'lives' a bot that can accept some input from a user and do what is requested. The pool of commands is f
inite and predefined.

**The issue**

So, putting details aside, the main issue to be solved is parsing user input (unst
ructured and possible incomplete data) to some structured form. In general, each and every user input should be transfor
med into a data structure that represents a sequence of commands with their parameters, for example:

User input: Please
, create X with param1 set to value1 and param2 equal to value2

Desired output:

    create_x --param1 value1 --param2 
value2

In this example, there is only one command, but in real life the request can represent a sequence of N commands,
 and they may depend on each other (sequence of execution does matter)

**What I've tried so far**

I have an 'experimen
t' environment: a python project with `ollama` and `langchain` installed. The main model I test is llama3.1-instruct wit
h 5bit quantization. (I'm sort of limited with hardware resourses, so XXB parameter models do not fit).

Up until now, I
've tried to achieve what I want with prompting in different forms, but in general I do the following:

1. As the very f
irst message in the chat, I create a 'system' one which explain what commands are there. The format is the following (I 
replaced original data not to expose the context more, so it's very generic): 

```xml
<scope>
    <models>
        <mod
el name='entityA'>
            <field name='uniqueId' type='string' description='unique identifier for entityA'/>
      
      <field name='label' type='string' description='label for entityA'/>
            <field name='category' type='enum'
 possible-value='alpha, beta, gamma, delta'/>
        </model>
        <model name='entityB'>
            <field name='u
niqueId' description='unique identifier for entityB'/>
            <field name='entityAIds' type='array' description='id
entifiers of entityAs associated with this entityB'/>
        </model>
    </models>
    <commands>
        <command nam
e='create_entityA' description='creates an instance of entityA'>
            <param name='uniqueId' type='string' descri
ption='unique identifier for entityA'/>
            <param name='label' type='string' description='label for entityA' re
quired='true'/>
            <param name='category' type='enum' possible-values='alpha, beta, gamma, delta'
             
      description='category of entityA (one value from the possible values list)' required='true'/>
        </command>
 
       <command name='remove_entityA' description='removes an instance of entityA by its unique identifier'>
           
 <param name='uniqueId' description='unique identifier of the entityA to be removed'
                   required='true'/
>
        </command>
        <command name='create_entityB'>
            <param name='label' description='label for enti
tyB'/>
        </command>
        <command name='link_entityAs_to_entityB'
                 description='associates inst
ances of entityA with a specific entityB based on the provided unique identifier of entityB'>
            <param name='u
niqueId' description='unique identifier of the entityB to which entityAs should be associated'
                   requir
ed='true'/>
            <param name='entityAIds'
                   description='an array of unique identifiers of entit
yAs to associate with the entityB'
                   type='array'
                   required='true'/>
        </comman
d>
        <command name='navigate' description='indicates that a user wants to go to a specific section of the platform
'>
            <param name='section' possible-values='entitiesA, entitiesB, configuration' required='true'/>
        </c
ommand>
        <command name='support' description='should be executed when a user seeks assistance on available functi
ons'/>
    </commands>
</scope>
```

So, now the model is provided with some context. Then, also in the 'system' message
 I:

* 'tell' the model that user input should be converted into a sequence of commands along with the corresponding par
ameters, all of this is described in the XML above
* describe the desired output format
* try to enforce some restrictio
n and cover edge cases

**The question part**

*Is this approach* ***viable***\*?\*

If yes, maybe there are some ***way
s to improve it***?

If not, *what would be* ***the alternative***?

So far I don't see how to apply fine tuning here

T
hank you in advance!
