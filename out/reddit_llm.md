Can you guys give feedback on this👇

https://youtu.be/Iyzvka711pc

Some highlights:
1. Have shown how you can leverage a
 deployed LLM (Llama2 in this case) from AWS SageMaker through the Langchain SageMaker module in your python application
. 

2. FastAPI backend (API endpoints) 

3. Embeddings are created offline (Currently in FAISS in memory).

```
So I created embeddings from few pdf-s. For now I tested some Vicuna and WizardLm models. Now I wanted to test Llama 2 m
odel so I got approved on HF and used this model: [https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-hf](https://huggingface
.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-hf)   
When I pass in my embeddings (I am using langchain) and prompt a simple question, like
 'What is X?' where X is some term, thing etc. from PDF, I get results where there short answer and URL for source from 
diffrent websites like [ask.com](https://ask.com) [wisegeek.com](https://wisegeek.com) etc. instead of my embeddings/doc
uments. On top of that there is same answer and same URL source repeated about 8times for example.  


Why is that? Is t
here a way around this? I don't get responses like this when using Vicuna or WizardLm for example. From Langchain I am u
sing  AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCasualLM, HuggingFacePipeline to create LLM.

I've been prototyping an application using langchain and FAISS that helps me to analyze long documents and then generate

I store the chunked data from the long documents in FAISS. 

I start by asking chat to develop a
n outline, and then I step through the outline sections, requesting chat to generate narrative to fill it in. 

But when
 I have the chat agent actually generate writing, I've found some success in storing those pieces in text files and appe
nding the writing into a prompt to have chat do additional edits and improvements. 

Should I instead be adding the narr
ative pieces into the vector database? Would that improve my performance, or is this a fine way of going about it? I fin
d that when I need to go back to a section from earlier in the convo, I just add it into the prompt as a reminder.

However, it is based on stateless OpenAI.

\- information is not up-to-date, no ability

\- No ability to use Open Source models like LLama2, and no Langchain

On the other hand we have Flowise that can do amazing things without coding and use open-source, b
ut it's not so direct for quick projects using a sheet logic. Ok Flowise is no code, but if you want to create batch stu
ff, you need to code.  


So the question is, how could I implement Flowise to sheets, the same way that GPT for sheets 
does.  


If I have a flow, and I can get it through a sheet, that would be so amazing for quick every day tasks. Also I
 could have a sheet of tasks, and let my computer run all night, instead of paying OpenAI.

all -  [ Are there any 'function calling' libraries that allow AI to talk to a class instance? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/15tzies/are_there_any_function_calling_libraries_that/) , 2023-08-21-0909
```
I'm looking for a library that can take a reference to a class instance and a list of prompts/messages.  Ideally it woul
d automatically generate the OpenAI API's 'functions' value from the functions in the class, reading docstring and/or ar
gument type annotations.

Possible usage:

    class MyClass():
      '''
      Get current temperature of a city.
    

      parameters:
      city(str): The US city, state.
    
      returns:
      temperature(int): Temperature in Fahren
heit
      ''' 
      def get_current_temperature(city: str) -> int:
         # implementation goes here
    
    my_obj
ect = MyClass()
    
    summary = openai_function_call(
        my_object,
        ['Is it hot in Miami, Florida?'],
  
      summarize = True)

    print(summary)

    # Prints: Yes, it is hot in Miami with a temperature of 95 degrees Fahr
enheit.

When `summarize == True`, it would do at least 2 API hits.  One per prompt to call functions(s), and a final ca
ll to summarize answers.  Langchain [works exactly this way](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_type
s/openai_multi_functions_agent) but you have to use their `Tool` class to wrap each function.

Bonus points if the class
's instance variables are included as part of the prompt (`json.dump(my_object.__dict__)`).

Does something like this ex
ist, in whole or in part?

UPDATE: I wrote my own.  I may open source it when I have the time.  With mine you can talk t
o a class instance.  It appends class variable values to the system message.  It supports mapping Python type annotation
s to JSON Schema.

```
I'm in the process of building a simple chatbot with langchain that can run inference on local data using an LLM model, 
pretty much similar to privateGPT. Here are some details: 

1. CSV Data loading using DirectoryLoader and RecursiveChara
cter splitting
2. SentenceTransformers embeddings and FAISS for search
3. Loading Llama-13b 8 bit ggml using CTransforme
rs on a machine with 45 GB RAM and V100 16 GB GPU
4. Querying with RetrievalQA

Everything is pretty standard.  While fo
r some queries it's working really well, for a lot of queries it's returning very non-sensical data. Here is an example:
 {'query': 'What are some AI predictions for the year 2030? ',  'result': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n
\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n
\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n
\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n
\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n' }  

Already tried with a few different models
, and changing parameters end-to-end but no use. I can see the answer is somewhat present in the input documents, and th
e documents are pretty much clean. My understanding is that the base model should be able to infer answer on its own, wh
ich it is doing for some simpler queries like 'Define xyz'  

Would really appreciate some help here :)

```
We've created an open source chat bot builder, on top of PostgresML. This tool makes it easy to ingest documents and set
 a system prompt for a chatbot with knowledge of your content. The innovation is in the simplicity and efficiency, rathe
r than the functionality.

PostgresML runs open source embedding models alongside pgvector in Postgres to implement chat
 bot prompt creation without any network calls, which makes it \~4x faster than competing architectures. It can also do 
text generation with that prompt (and no additional network hops) using any open source model from HuggingFace, but it a
lso integrates with the GPT-4 API if you'd like to use that instead. 

The full writeup including some benchmarks for co
mpeting architectures is here:  [https://postgresml.org/blog/pgml-chat-a-command-line-tool-for-deploying-low-latency-kno
wledge-based-chatbots-part-I](https://postgresml.org/blog/pgml-chat-a-command-line-tool-for-deploying-low-latency-knowle
dge-based-chatbots-part-I)

You can chat with a deployment that has access to our blogs and documentation content it in 
\[our Discord\]([https://discord.com/channels/1013868243036930099/1013868243536072868](https://discord.com/channels/1013

* The source code for 
the bot builder and server is only a few hundred lines of Python [https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/tree/master/p
gml-apps/pgml-chat#readme](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/tree/master/pgml-apps/pgml-chat#readme)
* The chat a
pp is so small, because it's delegates all the vector db and embedding generation options to our Python client SDK, whic
h is available for anyone to build other apps with: [https://pypi.org/project/pgml/](https://pypi.org/project/pgml/)
* T
he Python client SDK is so small, because it's just a wrapper around the Rust client SDK: [https://github.com/postgresml
/postgresml/tree/master/pgml-sdks/rust/pgml](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/tree/master/pgml-sdks/rust/pgml). 
Currently we also support JS/Typescript SDKs as well, all generated from the same safe and efficient underlying Rust imp
lementation, using some fancy Rust macros.
* The Rust client SDK is also pretty simple though, because it just delegates
 everything to the Postgres database extension, which is where everything is computed in a single GPU accelerated proces
s, without having to load any ML models, data, or dependencies on client apps, effectively eliminating all the typical M
L data<->model network hops. Which makes it faster, simpler and safer.

This lays out what we think a is a better approa
ch to AI application architecture compared to libraries like LangChain or LlamaIndex, that focus on glueing together dis
parate data stores, algorithms, models over the network.

MachineLearning -  [ [D] How we evaluated LLMs in prod ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15ogknd/d_how_we_evaluated_llms_in_prod/) , 2023-08-21-0909
```
This is going to be a post about the challenges I faced while working with ChatGPT in my previous company and the things
 we did to overcome them over a 2+ month struggle. Check us out at [www.twilix.io](https://www.twilix.io/) if anything b
elow resonates with you and I hope you find some of it helpful.

So to begin, in my previous company we invested a few m
onths building a chatbot to help with user onboarding. At first everything was great, and we saw a 40% decrease in drop-
off rates (which is significant given we were building a consumer facing app), but somehow over time this drop-off rate 
started creeping up again. Perplexed by the unexpected turn in metrics, management started to question the benefits of m
aintaining this chatbot and was skeptical that we were cherry picking examples to showcase its performance for the sake 
of not wasting our efforts. They also knew that GPT4 got shadow nerfed which didn't help our case at all.

We had a lot 
of back and forth and eventually came to the conclusion that somehow the chatbot performance have to be quantified to ju
stify it's purpose. So, our team spent another 2 months engineering an evaluation solution to show leadership that the c
hatbot is performing as expected while identifying areas of improvement to craft a more refined product roadmap. We ende
d up trying a lot of different things, and after a long process of iteration and experimentation here are the things tha
t worked for us:

1. Generating synthetic datasets (these act as 'ground truths' pair of queries and expected responses)
 to benchmark performance.
2. Training models to determine the similarity score to assess every ChatGPT output in produc
tion (we use the generated synthetic dataset to do this to compare expected responses vs real responses)
3. Classifying 
the type of use cases the chatbot was used for (this allowed us to see which use cases were performing worse)
4. Logging
 configurations in our LLM stack and building visualizations on the web to identify what gives the best results (tempera
ture, LangChain configurations, lLamaIndex chunking sizes, these type of configurations)
5. Monitoring how our costs and
 latency are affected by tweaking different parameters
6. Lastly, A/B test to figure out the optimal parameters on diffe
rent sets of users (from experience, typically for a user onboarding chatbot use case around 5,000 users interacting wit
h your chatbot should be enough to collect some meaningful datapoints)

The most important learnings that we took away w
as that whilst synthetic data is OK you do need to generate large amounts of it. The sweet spot is different depending o
n the use case + the specifics of your knowledge base (eg, a corpus of internal documents vs a collection of websites), 
and I say sweet spot because after a certain amount of datapoints everything else kind of becomes noise and actually neg
atively affects your analysis more than the benefit it brings.

We ended up showing where our chatbot onboarding experie
nce fell short and was able to fix it through rapid iteration. There's still no set standard for LLM evaluation but I ho
pe my previous experiences helped. (Our team is now building out this evaluation system as a standalone product at [www.
twilix.io](https://www.twilix.io/) so check us out if you also want some concrete proof that ChatGPT is performing as ex
pected for your business)

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Approach to creating an 'AI tutor' chatbot for a fantasy language? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15o4jy9/d_approach_to_creating_an_ai_tutor_chatbot_for_a/) , 2023-08-21-0909
```
What are the possible practical approaches to creating an 'AI tutor' for a custom fantasy language, i.e. a language whic
h is definitely not covered in any large, mainstream LLM?

Assume in the fantasy language (like Game of Throne's Dothrak
i, but completely custom, so it's guaranteed not to be covered at all by an existing LLM), we have a dictionary of terms
, and a simple description of a grammar. What can I do with that?

Initially I was thinking of using 'Retrieval-Augmente
d Generation' (RAG), where I would pass it my dictionary of terms and their definitions and the grammar doc (i.e. the so
urce documents), and using OpenAI's LLM and LangChain's API wrapper and Pinecone long-term memory vector database, store
 the dictionary/grammar in Pinecone's vector database. Then a query comes in to translate an English word to a fantasy w
ord, and it looks in the Pinecone DB for similar English words, then passes the results with the fantasy word to the LLM
, along with the query, and generates a nice English response, with the fantasy word somewhere in there.

But that doesn
't seem like it would work the more I think about it. Then if I want to add the ability for it to translate English to t
he fantasy language, that seems impossible without first having a huge corpus of translation material (which is complete
ly impractical for a fantasy language). So can an existing generic LLM take a grammar as input, and learn to speak a fan
tasy language? If so, how would you make that happen?

Or what are other approaches to accomplishing this sort of thing?

For Langchain users, what are the best text embedding models and vector stores (with similarity search) among the many i
ntegrations for connecting a AI model to text data? 

And does performance vary drastically from one model/database to a
nother?

Hello,

I have been working on an OpenAI-compatible API for serving LLAMA-2 models written entirely in Rust. It supports
 offloading computation to  Nvidia GPU and Metal acceleration for GGML models !

Here is the project  link: [Cria- Local
 LLAMA2 API](https://github.com/AmineDiro/cria)

You can use it as an OpenAI replacement (check out the included \`Langc
hain\` example in the project).

This is an ongoing project, I have implemented the \`embeddings\` and \`completions\` r
outes. The \`chat-completion\` route will be here very soon!

Really interested in your feedback and I would welcome any
 help :) !

I am working on a project that is very popular with the inception of Langchain + GPT applications. However, I want to ma
ke it open source and hence don't want to use GPT. So something like Langchain + LLama2, etc. I know currently Langchain
 only supports GPT but any other ideas are highly appreciated!

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Roadmap for AI engineer (implementation of language models on premise) ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15gzsfv/d_roadmap_for_ai_engineer_implementation_of/) , 2023-08-21-0909
```
 I worked for less than a year as a Data Engineer. I decided to look for other challenges and got a job as an AI enginee
r developing language models.

The product of the company that hired me is related to data and metadata management. My t
asks will be to introduce features to the product, including a chat function that will allow for asking questions about 
data. Other tasks will include research and proposing additional AI-related functionalities to the product (on premise).
 I have a two weeks left to start work and I need to prepare a bit. My job will involve implementing ready-made solution
s and conducting research (high level - I need to implement valuable features and no one cares how).

**What are the mos
t important things I should learn before starting work?**

First of all, I replicated a few applications from this blog:
 [https://blog.streamlit.io/tag/llms/](https://blog.streamlit.io/tag/llms/)

Then I have focused on Langchain. I'm also 
in the middle of a course on Udemy about Next-Gen AI projects - Beginner friendly - Langchain, Pinecone - OpenAI, Huggin
gFace & LLAMA 2 models

I need a roadmap that will guide me a bit. I'm looking for blogs/materials/courses that will giv
e me practical knowledge in this matter.

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Having trouble with RAG on company domain data ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15br11c/d_having_trouble_with_rag_on_company_domain_data/) , 2023-08-21-0909
```
I have a data set that isn't that large \~200 pdfs. I have done the regular RAG approach with Langchain, extracting text
, splitting into chunks, embedding with OpenAi embeddings and FAISS vector storage. However, when I do a similarity sear
ch with a question I would like answered it returns the wrong context. The documents are semi-structured information of 
examined bridges. A question I would like answered is f.e. 'what is the construction date of bridge X?'. When I input th
is question I get a lot of context of construction dates of other bridges. I think this is because the bridges are not e
xplicitly mentioned in the text. I tried adding the bridge name and document name to the page content string of the chun
ks, but this does nothing.

Does anyone have any tips on improving the embeddings retrieval in this case?

MachineLearning -  [ [D] How do I reduce LLM inferencing time? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15851sr/d_how_do_i_reduce_llm_inferencing_time/) , 2023-08-21-0909
```
I am running text inferencing on Llama2-7b through langchain. I have downloaded the model from langchain's Huggingface l
ibrary, and I am running the model on AWS ml.g4dn.12xlarge which has 4x**nvidia t4**, which gives a total 64GB of GPU me
mory and 192GB of normal memory. It is able to answer my queries in around 10 seconds for small queries, and upto 3 mins
 for big queries.

The task I am doing is retrieving information from a document(Understanding Machine Learning PDF) in 
a conversational way. I've extracted the main parts of the notebook and put it up [here](https://colab.research.google.c
om/drive/1uFNkZ6FI0qffwRpW6ubfdq0HrCqcqVUi?usp=sharing).

Where can I make changes to speed up the transaction. Is there
 any change I can do in the model configuration to speed it up? Because if I use HuggingFaceHubAPI, it is able to give a
n answer in less than 5 seconds. Are there any other areas I can optimise?

I appreciate any help you can provide. Thank
s!
