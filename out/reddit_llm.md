Dear Developers,

I have created this repository to support your projects. This is not a product but a template that wil
l **ease your workflow**.

Here's the background:

While working on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project, I fo
und that no existing chat UI template offered all the features I needed. In response, I decided to build my own, incorpo
rating those missing functionalities.

Chatbot UI: [https://convo-ui.vercel.app](https://convo-ui.vercel.app)

Repositor
y: [https://github.com/RaghaRao314159/Convo-UI](https://github.com/RaghaRao314159/Convo-UI)

**Key features included in 
both ConvoUI and TurboGPT:**

1. **Multiple Chats/Conversations Support:** While Gradio is great, it only supports a sin
gle active conversation at a time. My template addresses this by storing multiple chats locally (via localStorage) and l
inking them to authentication keys.
2. **Authentication:** The template integrates authentication using OpenAI API keys 
for security and access control.
3. **Dark and Light Mode:** This feature can adapt to system settings or be manually to
ggled in the UI, providing flexibility in appearance.

**New features that I added:**

1. **Markdown Table Parsing and D
isplay:** Many existing chatbot UI templates struggle with cleanly rendering markdown tables, including TurboGPT. My ver
sion resolves this, ensuring tables display as neatly as they do in OpenAI's UI.
2. **Custom Backend Model Integration:*
* Most chatbot UIs lack the ability to interact with custom backend models, as these typically require different object 
classes for communication compared to standard API calls. My template includes examples for calling backend models using
 Flask and Langserve. You can test this by selecting a backend model. Click to visit the [Backend Repo](https://github.c
om/RaghaRao314159/Convo-UI_backend).
3. **Streaming Chatbot Outputs:** While streaming outputs is straightforward with f
oundation models, it becomes complex when dealing with backend servers. After extensive testing, I successfully implemen
ted streaming capabilities for backend models in this template. Unfortunately, pythonanywhere voids this and my backend 
is currently on pythonanywhere. I will move it to another server in due time.



***I hope this template helps you accel
erate the development of your full-stack applications.***

-------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------

**More resources on building chatbots**

I have thoroughly explored various approaches to 
building a fully custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM chatbot, and the results of my work can be found in my 
[RAG repository](https://github.com/RaghaRao314159/AuditBot_backend). Unlike many other online resources, this repositor
y offers a complete full-stack solution for developing a RAG chatbot.

**For Frontend Developers:**

I have included mul
tiple UI options, from simple mockups to production-grade interfaces, along with the necessary code to integrate the fro
ntend with the backend. The chat interface is a React application, similar to this one, utilizing LangServe. You can fin
d the frontend code in the [AuditBot repository](https://github.com/RaghaRao314159/AuditBot_frontend).

**For Machine Le
arning Engineers:**

I have conducted extensive experiments to improve the RAG framework, covering techniques such as Hy
DE, recursive retrieval, and others. Additionally, the repository provides implementations of frameworks like Langchain 
and LlamaIndex. It also includes setups for data stores, examples of prompt engineering with GuardRails, and much more.

**Feedback**

Do let
 me know if you would like to see other additional features would be useful in a chatbot UI.

```
I have a background in time-series analysis and I work for a small company (read: startup) that works on GenAI. As part 
of that, my manager has asked me to produce ASAP a proof-of-concept implementation of an AI agent on large document reco
gnition ASAP - specifically, we have a meeting with a client wanting a PoC of an AI agent that you can ask questions to 
about a corpus of text that the client uploads.

Specifically, my manager has asked me to look into performing OCR on a 
large document (~200 pages) and uploading it into a Chroma vector store, and implementing a question-answer system with 
an AI agent that performs semantic understanding for the client to use. I'm going to be burning the midnight oil for the
 next few days so I'd like some advice on how to get started. Are there any tutorials or resources that I can deal with?


(Note: I posted this on the machine learning sub, but it looks like it got quietly removed the instant of posting...)

Anyone know why am I getting the following error on this . The endpoint is dedicated and deployed via Azure AI studio

```
I’m one of the cofounders of [Doctly.ai](http://doctly.ai/), and I want to share our story. Doctly wasn’t originally mea
nt to be a PDF-to-Markdown parser—we started by trying to feed complex PDFs into AI systems. One of the first natural st
eps in many AI workflows is converting PDFs to either markdown or JSON. However, after testing all the available solutio
ns (both proprietary and open-source), we realized none could handle the task without producing tons of errors, especial
ly with complex PDFs and scanned documents. So, we decided to tackle this problem ourselves and built Doctly. While our 
parser isn’t perfect, it far outpaces most others and excels at parsing text, tables, figures, and charts from PDFs with
 high precision.While no solution is perfect, Doctly is leagues ahead of the competition when it comes to precision. Our
 AI-driven parser excels at extracting text, tables, figures, and charts from even the most challenging PDFs. Doctly’s i
ntelligent routing automatically selects the ideal model for each page, whether it’s simple text or a complex multi-colu
mn layout, ensuring high accuracy with every document.  
With our API and Python SDK, it’s incredibly easy to integrate 
Doctly into your workflow. And as a thank-you for checking us out, we’re offering free credits so you can experience the
 difference for yourself. Head over to[ ](https://doctly.ai/)[Doctly.ai](http://doctly.ai/), sign up, and see how it can
 transform your document processing!

**API Documentation:** To get started with Doctly, you’ll first need to create an 
account on[ ](https://doctly.ai/)[Doctly.ai](http://doctly.ai/). Once you’ve signed up, you can generate an API key to s
tart using our SDK or API. If you’d like to explore the API without setting up a key right away, you can also log in wit
h your username and password to try it out directly. Just head to the[ Doctly API Docs](https://api.doctly.ai/docs), cli

```
I came to the LLM space from a data science background, so I've always had a belief that anything ML related is better d
one in python. Over the past few months I've been building full stack apps that all look something like this:

* vue.js 
frontend, hosted on vercel
* python flask backend, hosted separately on vercel serverless (same repo different deploymen
t, if that makes sens)
* The frontend gets some data from the user, makes a call to the backend to run some complex LLM 
pipeline that takes \~20 seconds, and displays the response.

The better I get at dealing with javascript and its unhing
ed ecosystem, the more I realize that I might not need the backend at all. Moreover, **I'd be able to display intermedia
te progress and steps while the user waits for the call to be completed**.

It feels like blasphemy, but I'm probably go
ing to start building out the LLM pipelines in javascript and calling the model APIs directly from the frontend. Managin
g the communication between the backend and frontend in a serverless environment has been a major pain in the ass and go
ing full js feels like the right move.

Has anyone gone through something similar? Anything tips or things to look out f
or would be greatly appreciated!

```
Hey!

Just like the title says, I've tested and published videos and posts about these frameworks. Today, I want to shar
e my **high-level view** about each framework and which could be the most suitable for your use case.

You can [find the
 \~8 min video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/2F-z9s4wgwk), but here's the gist of it:

**AutoGen**

AutoGen shines when i
t comes to autonomous code generation. Agents can self-correct, re-write, execute, and produce impressive code, especial
ly when it comes to solving programming challenges

**crewAI**

If you’re looking to get started quickly, CrewAI is prob
ably the easiest. Great documentation, tons of examples, and a solid community.

**LangGraph**

LangGraph, to me, offers
 more control and I feel that it's best suited for more complicated workflows, especially if you need Retrieval-Augmente
d Generation (RAG) or are juggling multiple tools and scenarios.

**OpenAI Swarm**

OpenAI just released Swarm a few day
s ago and I’m still testing it, but as they’ve said, it’s experimental. It's the simplest, cleanest, and most lightweigh
t of the bunch—but that also means it comes with the most limitations. It’s not ready for production use; it’s more for 
prototyping. Things could change quickly, though, since this space moves fast.

I hope you find this useful.

Cheers!

Hello Community,
I am looking to build out micro-saas out of RAG by combining both Software Engineering and AI principle
s. Have build out the version 1 of backend, with following features.

Features:
- SSO login
- Permission based access co
ntrol on data and quering
- Support for multiple data connectors like drive, dropbox, confluence, s3, gcp, etc
- Increme
ntal indexing
- Plug and play components for different parsers, dataloaders, retrievers, query mechanisms, etc
- Single 
Gateway for your open and closed source models, embeddings, rerankers with rate limiting and token limiting.
- Audit Tra
ils
- Open Telemetry for prompt logging, llm cost, vector db performance and gpu metrics

More features coming soon…

Mo
st importantly everything is built asynchronous, without heavy libraries like langchain or llamaindex. I am looking for 
community feedback to understand will these features be good for any business? If at all, is anyone interested to collab
orate either in help secure funding, frontend work, help me get connected with other folks, etc? 
Thank you!

I was recently trying to build an app using LLM’s but was having a lot of difficulty engineering my prompt to make sure 
it worked in every case while also having to keep track of what prompts did good on what.

So I built this tool that aut
omatically generates a test set and evaluates my model against it every time I change the prompt or a parameter. Given t
he input schema, prompt, and output schema, the tool creates an api for the model which also logs and evaluates all call
s made and adds them to the test set.

I just coded up the B

```
I'm working on a project where I have a dataset of approximately 1000 combinations of product characteristics (like form
at, page count, printing type, paper type, etc.). Although there is a lot of overlap, each row ultimately represents a u
nique combination of characteristics, and my task is to find the best match for a given product description coming from 
another dataset.

LLMs do not seem a good idea, as 1000 categories are a lot. Moreover, we're talking about categories w
ith very specific, technical nouns in them.

Initially, I thought of using **embeddings** (with models like NV-Embed-v2)
 to compare these descriptions based on cosine similarity. However, I'm wondering if this is the most effective strategy
, considering that some columns have very specific values that might benefit from exact or near-exact matching, while ot
hers may need more flexibility. 

So, my question is: i**s relying purely on embeddings the best strategy, or is there a
re some other strategy that I am missing here?** 

If anyone has worked on similar problems or has suggestions on how to
 approach this more efficiently, I’d love to hear your thoughts!

I am a 3rd year undergrad at IIT Bombay, India, and currently intern season is going on in our college and in my resume 
I have things like RAG and Chatbot. In my last two interviews, I was asked question from my resume and puzzles (Brainste

The question that was common in the both the interviews goes like '**What are some of the most common eval

 to know the quality of fthe model.

  
So right after my first interview I surfed the web to know some metrics to evalu
ate chatbots. I got to know about some on the methods but didn't got any metrics (like a value that can quantify whether
 my model is good or not).

Can anyone help me, explain or find some resources to learn the same.

```
So few days back, The company (huge Product based MNC) after a whole month of review , extended their Pre Placement Offe
rs to 2025 Undergraduates in which unfortunately I didn't get.
I was part of a Data Operations and Engineering team duri
ng my internship and me with another cointern came up with a GenAI solution to prepare a Data Validation Engine for the 
Data Product Platform which included a Semantic Table Recommendation based on Business Rule and a Natural Language Data 
Validation Platform with Dashboard to select , drag and drop and see end results. It was a complete Full Stack project f
or a 3year B.Tech student who straight got thrown into world of Oracle, PySpark, Langchain , NLP , React , FastAPI, and 
even we mounted the Dashboard as a specific route of API and almost prepared it for pre-production.

Now, our manager an
d other teammates (SDE I and II) said that this is a new team and one of most ambitious long term project and they are i
n need of personnel and based on what we accomplished in 2 months, they said they definitely wanted to see us back in Ja
nuary to improve the platform and actually push it into Production.

Also it's normal for the Company to push 90-100% co
nversion from Internship to Permanent Job offers from its last 3-4 year track record.

But everything changed, when the 
PPOs dropped in. Colleges were witnessing 30-50% conversion only and the conversions for the students didn't make any se
nse in any way. Though I was lucky enough to come back to college and get a backup Job Offer but I waited desperately fo
r this PPO since I felt like family in those two months and because of this I gave up my streaks of practice and got dev
iated from my own projects and everything. 
Today, I talked with one of my senior SDE from the team and he said that rev
iew of our work was impeccable and they were themselves shocked that we didn't get. My other co-intern who is also place
d in a backup offer had the same interaction who was himself shocked how could they cancel our PPOs.
The manager said , 
after they submitted the review and requirements, the HR gave no visibility to the managers themselves and hence no cons
ultation from the actual need was taken while extending. For a large organisation venturing deep into AI in daily life p
rojects, extending offers to 31/84 people and that too in Legacy Stack like C# , Java , Frontend was quite abnormal for 
the students. 

Though how much I pretend to be not affected by this event but deep down I am broken from inside. I work
ed day and night , I even worked from office every day where WFH was still there. 

Well, though I have this huge MNC in
ternship in experience, but in reality, I am not in that big of a college that anything I do can beat this company nor I
 was such consistent code-worm who kept on grinding Leetcode and DSA everyday. Now I am even worse than most in my colle
ge.

all -  [ Appending Tool Messages to the Final Response in a ReAct Agent
 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1g5so66/appending_tool_messages_to_the_final_response_in/) , 2024-10-20-0914
```
I'm currently working on a ReAct agent using LangGraph, where I'm calling various endpoints (tools) to generate the fina
l answer. My endpoints gives the final response in the tool message which has the required answer that I want. The agent
's workflow is as follows:

1. The user query is received, and the appropriate tool is selected based on the query type 
(e.g., RAG for general queries,  Web Search for current events and some other tools).
2. The selected tool is called, an
d the response is generated.
3. Then using assistant call I get the final response which has just the response and not o
ther fields that were given by tool message.

My challenge is that the structure of the final response generated by the 
assistant does not match the desired structure. The tool-generated answers contain quite a lot of fields that I want to 
include in the final answer.  
 For example:

{ 'data\_points': \[\], 'answer': '', 'sources': '', 'followup\_questions'
: \[\], 'thoughts': '', 'indexes': \[\], 'query': '', 'total\_tokens': , 'prompt\_tokens': , 'completion\_tokens': , 'ca
che\_hit': , 'history': \[ { 'user': '' } \], 'prompt\_prefix': '', 'instructions': \[\], 'agent\_mode': '', 'references
': \[ { 'order': , 'url': '', 'number': } \] }

Ideally, I would like to take the ToolMessage from the state and append 
it to the final response to have more control over the response structure. This way, I can customize the final response 
to include all the relevant fields from the tool-generated answers. I tried structure output formatting but that did not
 work for me.  What would be the best to achieve this?

But these feel overly reductive, since they don't address complexities like:  
1) when
 to retrieve vs. just respond immediately to reduce latency  
2) rely on existing context previously retrieved in the co
nversation instead of retrieving again at the current turn  
3) partition LLM context between retrieved information and 
past conversation history.

I'm sure some teams already have good systems for this, would appreciate pointers!

MachineLearning -  [ Built a web agent which call fill Google forms based on the user details [P] ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fozud5/built_a_web_agent_which_call_fill_google_forms/) , 2024-10-20-0914
```
GitHub repo : [https://github.com/shaRk-033/web-agent](https://github.com/shaRk-033/web-agent)

Tried to solve it using 
two approaches:

# 1: Basic Scraping and Filling

This is the straightforward approach. The agent scrapes the form’s HTM
L and uses fixed XPaths to find and fill in the required fields.

* It pulls the form’s HTML, locates the fields with se
t XPaths, and inputs the answers. It’s a direct and simple method.
* If the form changes or an element isn’t where it’s 
expected, the process can fail and may need manual adjustments.

[basic approach](https://preview.redd.it/5e8g4a1k4xqd1.

2. Using LangChain Agents and tool call
ing

* LangChain Agent**:** The agent handles everything by using the LLM’s reasoning to decide what to do next, includi
ng generating those tricky XPaths.
* Error Handling**:** If something goes wrong (like an element not found), the agent 
tries again with better XPaths until it gets the job done.

Any recommendations to improve this w
ould be welcome. Also, if anyone has ideas on building similar web agents to automate other tasks, it would be great to 
hear them. :)

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Swapping Embedding Models for an LLM ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fktvbj/p_swapping_embedding_models_for_an_llm/) , 2024-10-20-0914
```
How tightly coupled is an embedding model to a language model?

Taking an example from Langchain's tutorials, they use O
llama's _nomic-embed-text_ for embedding and _Llama3.1_ for the understanding and Q/A. I don't see any documentation abo
ut Llama being built on embeddings from this embedding model. 

Intuition suggests that a different embedding model may 
produce outputs of other sizes or produce a different tensor for a character/word, which would have an impact on the res
ults of the LLM. So would changing an embedding model require retraining/fine-tuning the LLM as well?

I need to use a e
mbedding model for code snippets and text. Do I need to find a specialized embedding model for that? If yes, how will ll
ama3.1 ingest the embeddings?
