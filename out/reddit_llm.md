```
Hi there. I'm a non-developer (Product person) trying to build a basic mental model for how we might build a chatbot tha
t would allow our internal support team to interact with our propietary knowledgebase. Our KB currently resides in Notio
n.

I've been reading up on and watching videos about the LangChain framework, the differences between In-Context Learni
ng and Fine Tuning, Vector databases/embeddings etc. So I've got a rough handle on the overall architecture.

Where I'm 
a little stumped right now is how to think about the process of actually getting our KB content from Notion into a Vecto
r DB. More specifically, I'm interested in understanding (at a high, abstract level) how to think about keeping that kno
wledge up to date. For example, as the support team updates KB articles, having some mechanism in place for updating the
 Vector DB automatically so that it's always pulling from the latest information automatically. I believe I've seen Chat
bot apps out there that let you plug in a URL to scrape data from and then have it update every \~24 hours or so.

Can a
nyone share with me the big building blocks involved with implementing something like this? Is there typically some sort
 of cron job that's scraping the KB at regular intervals and then moving that data into the Vector DB?

Thanks in advanc
e.

Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155) 

Github: [https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML
/docs/Use-Cases/Autogen/](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Autogen/) 

Abstract:

>This technical report
 presents AutoGen, a new framework that enables development of LLM applications using multiple agents that can converse 
with each other to solve tasks. AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and seamlessly allow human participation. 
They can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools. AutoGen's design offers mul
tiple advantages: a) it gracefully navigates the strong but imperfect generation and reasoning abilities of these LLMs; 
b) it leverages human understanding and intelligence, while providing valuable automation through conversations between 
agents; c) it simplifies and unifies the implementation of complex LLM workflows as automated agent chats. We provide ma
ny diverse examples of how developers can easily use AutoGen to effectively solve tasks or build applications, ranging f
rom coding, mathematics, operations research, entertainment, online decision-making, question answering, etc.

diffrent websites like [ask.com](https://ask.com) [wisegeek.com](https://wisegeek.com) etc. instead of my embeddings/doc

Friends,

I'm planning to build a streaming API  using fastapi for my langchain based application. For the frontend, Im 
looking for an embeddable chat widget for my web application. The widget can talk to my streaming API endpoint for data.
 I have seen the flowise widget, but I do not want to use flowise for backend as I feel its capabalities are limited at 
this moment. Any opensource suggestions for such a widget  ?

Thanks

Hi there!

I have been working on a project to build a customer service chatbot. The bot would interact with clients and
 answer their questions. It will have access to documents to help it answer questions about things like pricing, availab

I have been looking into langchain but I could only find qa agents, not chatbots whose tone and attitu
de can be adjusted by prompting.

Has anyone worked on something similar? Are there any open source projects for somethi

I would be grateful if someone can offer any tips/help

MachineLearning -  [ [P] pgml-chat: A command-line tool for deploying low-latency knowledge-based chatbots ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15t5nzl/p_pgmlchat_a_commandline_tool_for_deploying/) , 2023-08-22-0909
```
We've created an open source chat bot builder, on top of PostgresML. This tool makes it easy to ingest documents and set
 a system prompt for a chatbot with knowledge of your content. The innovation is in the simplicity and efficiency, rathe
r than the functionality.

PostgresML runs open source embedding models alongside pgvector in Postgres to implement chat
 bot prompt creation without any network calls, which makes it \~4x faster than competing architectures. It can also do 
text generation with that prompt (and no additional network hops) using any open source model from HuggingFace, but it a
lso integrates with the GPT-4 API if you'd like to use that instead. 

The full writeup including some benchmarks for co
mpeting architectures is here:  [https://postgresml.org/blog/pgml-chat-a-command-line-tool-for-deploying-low-latency-kno
wledge-based-chatbots-part-I](https://postgresml.org/blog/pgml-chat-a-command-line-tool-for-deploying-low-latency-knowle
dge-based-chatbots-part-I)

You can chat with a deployment that has access to our blogs and documentation content it in 
\[our Discord\]([https://discord.com/channels/1013868243036930099/1013868243536072868](https://discord.com/channels/1013

* The source code for 
the bot builder and server is only a few hundred lines of Python [https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/tree/master/p
gml-apps/pgml-chat#readme](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/tree/master/pgml-apps/pgml-chat#readme)
* The chat a
pp is so small, because it's delegates all the vector db and embedding generation options to our Python client SDK, whic
h is available for anyone to build other apps with: [https://pypi.org/project/pgml/](https://pypi.org/project/pgml/)
* T
he Python client SDK is so small, because it's just a wrapper around the Rust client SDK: [https://github.com/postgresml
/postgresml/tree/master/pgml-sdks/rust/pgml](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/tree/master/pgml-sdks/rust/pgml). 
Currently we also support JS/Typescript SDKs as well, all generated from the same safe and efficient underlying Rust imp
lementation, using some fancy Rust macros.
* The Rust client SDK is also pretty simple though, because it just delegates
 everything to the Postgres database extension, which is where everything is computed in a single GPU accelerated proces
s, without having to load any ML models, data, or dependencies on client apps, effectively eliminating all the typical M
L data<->model network hops. Which makes it faster, simpler and safer.

This lays out what we think a is a better approa
ch to AI application architecture compared to libraries like LangChain or LlamaIndex, that focus on glueing together dis
parate data stores, algorithms, models over the network.

A lot of you might be giving me a mouthful just by reading the title of this blog. But to each their own, and probably y
ou might be just riding the hype train. Initially, I was quite fascinated by the work being done on LangChain and using 
it. And so I thought I would give it a try, but when I was installing it, I saw it downloading loads and loads of other 
libraries and most of which were not useful for what I was trying to build.

MachineLearning -  [ [D] How we evaluated LLMs in prod ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15ogknd/d_how_we_evaluated_llms_in_prod/) , 2023-08-22-0909
```
This is going to be a post about the challenges I faced while working with ChatGPT in my previous company and the things
 we did to overcome them over a 2+ month struggle. Check us out at [www.twilix.io](https://www.twilix.io/) if anything b
elow resonates with you and I hope you find some of it helpful.

So to begin, in my previous company we invested a few m
onths building a chatbot to help with user onboarding. At first everything was great, and we saw a 40% decrease in drop-
off rates (which is significant given we were building a consumer facing app), but somehow over time this drop-off rate 
started creeping up again. Perplexed by the unexpected turn in metrics, management started to question the benefits of m
aintaining this chatbot and was skeptical that we were cherry picking examples to showcase its performance for the sake 
of not wasting our efforts. They also knew that GPT4 got shadow nerfed which didn't help our case at all.

We had a lot 
of back and forth and eventually came to the conclusion that somehow the chatbot performance have to be quantified to ju
stify it's purpose. So, our team spent another 2 months engineering an evaluation solution to show leadership that the c
hatbot is performing as expected while identifying areas of improvement to craft a more refined product roadmap. We ende
d up trying a lot of different things, and after a long process of iteration and experimentation here are the things tha
t worked for us:

1. Generating synthetic datasets (these act as 'ground truths' pair of queries and expected responses)
 to benchmark performance.
2. Training models to determine the similarity score to assess every ChatGPT output in produc
tion (we use the generated synthetic dataset to do this to compare expected responses vs real responses)
3. Classifying 
the type of use cases the chatbot was used for (this allowed us to see which use cases were performing worse)
4. Logging
 configurations in our LLM stack and building visualizations on the web to identify what gives the best results (tempera
ture, LangChain configurations, lLamaIndex chunking sizes, these type of configurations)
5. Monitoring how our costs and
 latency are affected by tweaking different parameters
6. Lastly, A/B test to figure out the optimal parameters on diffe
rent sets of users (from experience, typically for a user onboarding chatbot use case around 5,000 users interacting wit
h your chatbot should be enough to collect some meaningful datapoints)

The most important learnings that we took away w
as that whilst synthetic data is OK you do need to generate large amounts of it. The sweet spot is different depending o
n the use case + the specifics of your knowledge base (eg, a corpus of internal documents vs a collection of websites), 
and I say sweet spot because after a certain amount of datapoints everything else kind of becomes noise and actually neg
atively affects your analysis more than the benefit it brings.

We ended up showing where our chatbot onboarding experie
nce fell short and was able to fix it through rapid iteration. There's still no set standard for LLM evaluation but I ho
pe my previous experiences helped. (Our team is now building out this evaluation system as a standalone product at [www.
twilix.io](https://www.twilix.io/) so check us out if you also want some concrete proof that ChatGPT is performing as ex
pected for your business)

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Approach to creating an 'AI tutor' chatbot for a fantasy language? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15o4jy9/d_approach_to_creating_an_ai_tutor_chatbot_for_a/) , 2023-08-22-0909
```
What are the possible practical approaches to creating an 'AI tutor' for a custom fantasy language, i.e. a language whic
h is definitely not covered in any large, mainstream LLM?

Assume in the fantasy language (like Game of Throne's Dothrak
i, but completely custom, so it's guaranteed not to be covered at all by an existing LLM), we have a dictionary of terms
, and a simple description of a grammar. What can I do with that?

Initially I was thinking of using 'Retrieval-Augmente
d Generation' (RAG), where I would pass it my dictionary of terms and their definitions and the grammar doc (i.e. the so
urce documents), and using OpenAI's LLM and LangChain's API wrapper and Pinecone long-term memory vector database, store
 the dictionary/grammar in Pinecone's vector database. Then a query comes in to translate an English word to a fantasy w
ord, and it looks in the Pinecone DB for similar English words, then passes the results with the fantasy word to the LLM
, along with the query, and generates a nice English response, with the fantasy word somewhere in there.

But that doesn
't seem like it would work the more I think about it. Then if I want to add the ability for it to translate English to t
he fantasy language, that seems impossible without first having a huge corpus of translation material (which is complete
ly impractical for a fantasy language). So can an existing generic LLM take a grammar as input, and learn to speak a fan
tasy language? If so, how would you make that happen?

Or what are other approaches to accomplishing this sort of thing?

would it be possible to train or fine-tune a small (1-3B) model who's sole purpose is to perform function calls? similar
 to how we have tiny models like replit-v2-3B that are super capable at specific things like code auto-complete .  


i 
know that's how openAI implemented function call was by fine-tuning gpt-3.5/4 but I'm thinking just a straight up base m
odel trained to understand and excel at function calls (similar to Gorilla for apis)

i'm thinking it would be a perfect
 'glue' for bigger LLM apps-- avoiding the need for external tools like langchain/quidance/etc...

examined bridges. A question I would like answered is f.e. 'what is the construction date of bridge X?'. When I input th
