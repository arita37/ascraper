```
Hi, I'm new to langchain or genai tools, so I'm trying to understand how things work..

I don't know why a similarity se
arch on a vectorstore (I used faiss-cpu with langchain) and reranking using RankLLMRerank & ContextualCompressionRetriev
er would use my local gpu by default. 

For embeddings model while building vector store, it seemed that the embedding m
odel is downloaded and cached locally (not sure if it's general behavior or because I was using embedding model from hug
ging face).

Is it langchain side or something else (faiss etc) that requires local run of those model? Is there any oth
er way exist?

I get that it's advantageous to have gpu when loading and running models locally, but I'd like to know if
 it can also work with cpu only as my instance in cloud may not have gpu (just by choice).

Is it possible to choose dev
ice to cpu only? Would it be prohibitively slow?

```
Hi guys

 I'm looking to build an app that uses a PDF as a knowledge base and allows users to upload additional PDFs. Th
e goal is for the app to provide responses based on the combined content of these PDFs. The documents are quite long (ar
ound 100 pages) and are in Polish.

I attempted to use the OpenAI Playground to upload PDFs for Assistants, but it faile
d miserably. 

I'm new to AI and unsure whether to use something like LangChain or another tool. I came across tools lik
e Upstage, which seems to be a bit better.

 I know how to code and will manage to follow any stack needed.

 Could anyo
ne suggest what tools or frameworks I should use to build this app? 

Thanks!

Barely receiving any callbacks, having applied to at least 200 roles. Being an international student, I understand needi

e is concerned.

I am currently in the first year of my master's degree and have been applying to internships since July
. The only OA's I have received are from HFT's, which I suspect are sent automatically right after application. I have b
een applying to positions everywhere and have no issues with relocation or remote work. I have not restricted my applica
tions in any way and have been applying to positions at big tech, startup, non-tech firms and any organization that has 
opened up roles for Summer 2025 internships

Please let me know what I can improve on my resume

Hi all, I've been working on a Apache beam and langchian integration and would like to share it here.

Apache beam is a 
great model for data processing. It provides abstractions to create data processing logic as components that can be appl
ied on data in batch and stream processing ETL pipelines 

langchian-beam integrates LLMs into the apache beam pipeline 
using langchian to use LLMs capabilities for data processing, transformations and RAG. 

Would like to hear any feedback
, suggestions and am interested in collaborating on Langchain-Beam!

all -  [ RAG for Documents ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1gqd7am/rag_for_documents/) , 2024-11-14-0912
```
Hi everyone!

I have a startup that develops RAG systems for documents (i.e. contracts, RFPs, technical guides, educatio
nal materials, etc). I'm not here to promote it but to ask your honest opinions.

We've created a proprietary RAG framew
ork for documents integrated with LangChain. I believe the advantages are:

1. it uses hybrid search (vector + keyword);

2. vector search uses embeddings generated by models that we've fine-tuned;
3. Results are ranked using models that we'
ve also fine-tuned;
4. It's highly customizable, and we can change search steps, switch models used for embeddings and r
anking, etc.
5. It's scalable, and we can run in multiple nodes using microservices (i.e. our framework is running in a 
client with more than 5 million legal docs).

This framework is not open so we currently use it only to gain productivit
y in our projects so we can deploy a 'chat-gpt like' solution for our clients data in 1-2 months.

Do you think this kin
d of framework is interesting? Or the features I mentioned would be something you prefer to implement by yourself or usi
ng some other library?

Also, do you think I should focus on developers and commercialize this framework or open source 
it and monetize it somehow? Or perhaps should I stay with my current business model and just address end users?

all -  [ Parsing complex pdf tables  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gqa3zk/parsing_complex_pdf_tables/) , 2024-11-14-0912
```
Hello,

I'd like to parse complex pdf consisting of numerous tables, such as the following :

Each symbol correspond to 
a symbol description. Ideally I'd like to have a structured JSON with key/values corresponding to the content of each ta
bles. Like I'd like to have a key 'symbol information' containing a dict, which will contains keys 'symbol  graphic name
' but also three different dicts for each sub-element, and then another dict for symbol portrayal rules and another one 
for label information.

I tried Langchain (qwen 2.5 32b) with pydantic, it seems to work on some pages but it fails on o
ther when there are really big text paragraphs in some fields. I guess this is because it only relies on pure text witho
ut any visual cue of how the text is spatially distributed in the pdf and its getting confused... Do you have any advice
 ?

Hello LLM Bro's,  
  
I‚Äôm a Gen AI developer with experience building chatbots using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG
) and working with frameworks like LangChain and Haystack. Now, I‚Äôm eager to dive deeper into large language models (LLM
s) but need to boost my Python skills. I‚Äôm looking for motivated individuals who want to learn together.I‚Äôve gathered re
sources on LLM architecture and implementation, but I believe I‚Äôll learn best in a collaborative online environment. Com
munity and accountability are essential!If you‚Äôre interested in exploring LLMs‚Äîwhether you're a beginner or have some ex
perience‚Äîlet‚Äôs form a dedicated online study group. Here‚Äôs what we could do:

* Review the latest LLM breakthroughs
* Wo
rk through Python tutorials
* Implement simple LLM models together
* Discuss real-world applications
* Support each othe
r through challenges

Once we grasp the theory, we can start building our own LLM prototypes. If there‚Äôs enough interest
, we might even turn one into a minimum viable product (MVP).I envision meeting 1-2 times a week to keep motivated and m
ake progress‚Äîwhile having fun!This group is open to anyone globally. If you‚Äôre excited to learn and grow with fellow LLM
 enthusiasts, shoot me a message! Let‚Äôs level up our Python and LLM skills together!

What is the best approach for implementing CSV RAG,  text-to-sql, or by

all -  [  Need Help Optimizing Document Retrieval in LangChain for RAG App ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1gq77ub/need_help_optimizing_document_retrieval_in/) , 2024-11-14-0912
```
Hey everyone!



I‚Äôm building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using LangChain and could use some help
 optimizing my document retrieval strategy.



The Setup:

I started with an ensemble retriever using Hybrid Search, whi
ch combines TF-IDF for keyword search with other methods. The problem is that it struggles to return relevant documents 
when questions are rephrased, likely because TF-IDF focuses on exact keyword matches rather than semantic similarity.




I then tried the multi-query retriever, and while it improved relevance, it came with two issues:



Longer retrieval t
imes: It‚Äôs noticeably slower.

High token count: The retrieved documents are too large, making the overall process a bit
 inefficient.

What I‚Äôm Looking For:

An ideal solution would handle rephrased or semantically similar questions effecti
vely while also keeping retrieval times low and token counts manageable.



Has anyone faced something similar or found 
an effective retrieval approach within LangChain that balances relevance, speed, and token efficiency? Any tips, alterna
te retrievers, or other optimizations would be super helpful!



Thanks in advance!

```
Currently I'm working on a project 'Car Companion' in this project I've used unstructured to extract text, tables and im
ages and generate summaries for images and tables using Llama-3.2 vision model and stored all these docs and summaries i
n a chroma vectorstore. It's a time taking process because the manual PDFs contains 100's of pages. It takes a lot of ti
me to extract Text and generate summaries.

Question: Now my question is, how to do all these process on a user uploaded
 pdf?

Should we need to  follow the same text extraction and image summary generation process?

If so, it would take a 
lot of time to process right?

Is there any alternative for this?

```
As an international student, I‚Äôm finding it incredibly challenging to secure an internship, whether it be for winter, su
mmer 2025, or even a one-semester gap year opportunity. I‚Äôve applied to around 400 positions on LinkedIn and other job b
oards. I‚Äôve received about 12-15 online assessments, which I feel I performed well on, but I haven‚Äôt managed to secure a
ny interviews. I suspect my resume might be part of the issue.

If anyone could help me review my resume or connect me t
o potential opportunities, I‚Äôd be grateful. Internships in my home country or elsewhere in Asia have yielded positive fe
edback, but I am focused on finding an internship in the U.S., which has been incredibly difficult. I feel confused and 
discouraged, like I‚Äôm at a loss for what to do next.

all -  [ LangGraph Virtual Meetup Series ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1gq1vbp/langgraph_virtual_meetup_series/) , 2024-11-14-0912
```
hey everyone!

  
getting right to it: if someone were to put on a series of virtual Meetup events specifically focused 
on LangGraph, how many people in this sub would have interest in attending? 

the big thing that we're missing right now
 is speakers and presenters. i'm more than happy to present once or more than once if necessary, but i think everyone wo
uld benefit from hearing from devs, researchers, or technical leaders with experience implementing this stuff at scale i
n production, or maybe designing tooling/behavior for LangGraph objects or state properties at a very low level. on a he
avily biased note, it'd be cool to have some JavaScript/TypeScript devs involved also.

does that sound fun, interesting
, and/or useful to anyone in this group? if so, just leave a comment with your rough location in the world (so there's a
n idea of what time zone we want to target) and something you want to hear talked about. if you want to present, send me
 an email at [glassBead-tc@proton.me](mailto:glassBead-tc@proton.me) or a DM in the Slack: i'm the only person called gl
assBead in the community so far that i'm aware of. i'm not great at being instantly responsive but i do keep up with my 
inbox: hit me up!

EDIT: I‚Äôm so happy to see the response this morning, this is already making my day and the sun‚Äôs not 
up yet. Awesome to see, for real.

I‚Äôll start figuring out scheduling constraints and get back to everyone ASAP with som
e dates and times: I don‚Äôt want to just default to wrecking the night of whoever happens to be on IST that wants to come
.

Has anyone found use cases for the small llm models? Think in the 3b to 12b range, like llama 3.5 11b, llama 3.2 3b or m

So far, for everything I tried, those models are essentially useless. They don‚Äôt follow instructions a

Curious what the purpose/use cases are for these models.

Hey! I've been working on a project called Dendrite which simple framework for interacting with websites using natural l
anguage. Interact and extract without having to find brittle css selectors or xpaths like this:

    browser.click(‚Äúthe 
sign in button‚Äù)

For the developers who like their code typed, specify what data you want with a Pydantic BaseModel and
 Dendrite returns it in that format with one simple function call. Built on top of playwright for a robust experience. T
his is an easy way to give your AI agents the same web browsing capabilities as humans have. Integrates easily with fram
eworks such as¬† Langchain, CrewAI, Llamaindex and more.¬†

We are planning on¬†**open sourcing**¬†everything soon as well s

Hello

I am building a RAG chatbot. I mostly use langchain and openai for this stuff. However this chatbot will start wi
th RAG but will have other features like document understanding and etc down the road. So now I'm wondering what I shoul
d be using
I have narrowed it down to these 
- langchain
- crewai
- langgraph

I've been playing with crewai but I still
 don't know how to use it as chatbot. Langchain is easy but I fear it does not have those agentic flows. Langgraph feels
 too young and for some reason has way less stars than crew.ai

**A bit about the chatbot**  
The chat
bot will be doing a lot of things, many that even we dont know atm.

* The chatbot will function as a full website navig
ator, capable of performing nearly all site functions.
* It will use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and make API c
alls to various services based on inputs and conditions.
* The bot must track user interactions, including cart contents
, clicks, and current page. It should be state aware
* It will handle document uploads, initiating a document understand
ing workflow when necessary.

I installed supabase, postgre, docker and git cloned the open-canvas.

I've had everything running on my server but when
 I login it says 'no thread exists' or a similar error.  The logins work, everything loads, but trying to use any functi
on gets a thread error.

I think I've tracked it down to I never setup a langgraph.  In my .env I never set langgraph\_a
pi\_url   have no clue where to get the langgraph\_api\_url.

I have a langsmith account, I was planning to use their cl
oud for setup and production for my team.

I clic
k on Langgraph deployment on the left in their website, get the screen.

**LangGraph Studio**

**All LangSmith users on Plus, Premier, Startup, or Enterprise plans can

Then I can't figure out what to do or where to get

If I Langgraph studio at the top right it asks for my local endpoint, I don't know what to put in there.

Hi all, I've been working on a Apache beam and langchian integration and would like to share it here.

Apache beam is a 
great model for data processing. It provides abstractions to create data processing logic and apply it on data in batch

langchian-beam integrates LLMs into the apache beam pipeline using langchian to use LL

Hi everyone,



I‚Äôm new to using Meta‚Äôs LLaMA models and want to explore using the LLaMA 3.2 8B model for a retrieval-au
gmented generation (RAG) application with LangChain in Python. I‚Äôm comfortable working with GPT models, but I‚Äôm not sure
 how to start with LLaMA, especially within LM Studio.



Can anyone provide a step-by-step guide or point me to resourc
es on how to:



1. Load and configure the LLaMA model in LM Studio?

2. Connect the model to LangChain for a basic RAG 
workflow?



I‚Äôd appreciate any guidance on installation, setup, or potential limitations with the LLaMA 3.2 model in LM
 Studio. Thanks so much!

all -  [ What platform/system/language to use for orchestrating multiple AI agents for a thesis project? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rag/comments/1gpj6hb/what_platformsystemlanguage_to_use_for/) , 2024-11-14-0912
```
Hi everyone!

I am currently working on my thesis assignment. For this research, I am investigating the possibility of c
reating a GraphRAG system that allows citizen developers to ask natural language questions about their Low-Code applicat
ions. 

I already have created a script that transforms an application into a graph database (Neo4J)

To enhance the LLM
 response I aim to create a setup where a user can ask a question in natural language. This question is then sent to an 
AI agent that translates the question into a Cypher query. This query is then sent to the database to retrieve the relev
ant context. The context along with the original question is then sent to another AI agent that uses the retrieved conte
xt as 'truth' and uses that information to answer the original question.

I have seen many debates about using different
 approaches for setting this up such as AutoGPT, Langchain, FlowiseAI etc. However, to me they all seem to do somewhat s
imilar things and their websites are mostly full of marketable hype terms promising to be silver-bullet for any AI probl
em.

Do you guys have any ideas or suggestions? I'm sorry if I made any mistakes or confusing statements I am a student 
that has no real previous experience working with LLMs and AI.

Here is a paper I found that did something similar for P
ython project: [https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03910](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03910) however, they built their ch
atbot using modelscope and therefore a lot of pages are written in manadarin and I can't seem to set it up similarly.

T
hanks!

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Open-source declarative framework to build LLM applications - looking for contributors ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gkpazh/p_opensource_declarative_framework_to_build_llm/) , 2024-11-14-0912
```
I've been building LLM-based applications, and was super frustated with all major frameworks - langchain, autogen, crewA
I, etc. They also seem to introduce a pile of unnecessary abstractions. It becomes super hard to understand what's going
 behind the curtains even for very simple stuff.

[So I just published this open-source framework¬†GenSphere.](https://gi
thub.com/octopus2023-inc/gensphere)¬†The idea is have something like¬†**Docker for LLMs**. You build applications with YAM
L files, that define an execution graph. Nodes can be either LLM API calls, regular function executions or other graphs 
themselves. Because you can nest graphs easily, building complex applications is not an issue, but at the same time you 
don't lose control.

You basically code in YAML, stating what are the tasks that need to be done and how they connect. O
ther than that, you only write individual python functions to be called during the execution. No new classes and abstrac
tions to learn.

Its all open-source. **Now I'm looking for contributors** to adapt the framework for cycles and conditi
onal nodes - which would allow full-fledged agentic system building! Pls reach out ¬†if you want to contribute, there are
 tons of things to do!

PS:¬†[you can read the detailed docs here,](https://gensphere.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)¬†And go o
