```
I'm working on a RAG project involving numerous PDFs and documents.

The documents frequently include screenshots that v
isually illustrate the surrounding text. Given the abundance of these screenshots and their high level of detail, I'm co
ncerned that using a multimodal model to describe the images might be both costly and potentially inaccurate.

As an alt
ernative, I'm considering using image embedding techniques with some form of positional referencing or indexing. I'm int
erested in finding valuable examples or resources that implement this approach, particularly using Langchain or other si
milar frameworks.

Additionally, I'm curious if certain vector databases are better suited for this specific use case. A
ny insights or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

all -  [ Dynamic crawling using LLMs ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1fdtgdv/dynamic_crawling_using_llms/) , 2024-09-11-0912
```
I use crawling quite a bit for different parts of my job and have used platforms like scraperapi as well as apis from sc
rapy and others. In recent times i tried firecrawl as well [r.jina.ai](http://r.jina.ai) as well - for crawling. However
, they were all less than perfect. So I defined my own way of crawling and figured this can be quite straight forward..


Basically you can provide a json for what you'd like to have and then ask openai or claude with a url to convert it to 
the provided json - this will convert any website into a json format. 

Now instead of doing it again and again with llm
, you can ask llm to write a code that produces the json output you are expecting given the website.. and you get a code
 that works perfectly and if there are errors you can ask llm to correct it. 

It works quite well for me .. I put up th
e code here [https://github.com/alinaqi/dynamic\_crawler](https://github.com/alinaqi/dynamic_crawler) for anyone who may
 find it interesting.. 

Happy to hear from others on what they think about the approach.

```
Hey All,

  
Today I am sharing with you R2R, a project that I have been working on for the last year. R2R is an open so
urce RAG engine that changes your focus as a developer from building RAG pipelines to configuring them. The north star f
or this project is to become the Elasticsearch for RAG.

  
R2R comes with the following features:

* [**üìÅ Multimodal In
gestion**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/documentation/configuration/ingestion/overview): Parse¬†`.txt`,¬†`.pdf`,¬†`.json`,¬†`.
png`,¬†`.mp3`, and more.
* [**üîç Hybrid Search**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/cookbooks/hybrid-search): Combine semantic an
d keyword search with reciprocal rank fusion for enhanced relevancy.
* [**üîó Graph RAG**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/cook
books/graphrag): Automatically extract relationships and build knowledge graphs.
* [**üóÇÔ∏è App Management**](https://r2r-d
ocs.sciphi.ai/cookbooks/user-auth): Efficiently manage documents and users with full authentication.
* [**üî≠ Observabilit
y**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/cookbooks/observability): Observe and analyze your RAG engine performance.
* [**üß© Config
urable**](https://r2r-docs.sciphi.ai/documentation/configuration/introduction): Provision your application using intuiti
ve configuration files.
* [**üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard**](https://github.com/SciPhi-AI/R2R-Dashboard): An open-source React+Next.js a
pp with optional authentication, to interact with R2R via GUI.

# 

We've worked really hard to make the documentation r
obust and as developer friendly as possible. The feedback we are getting from other developers that are switching from a
lternative approaches like LangChain has been very positive.

  
I just wanted to share our work with you all here as I 
am confident that this can accelerate many of your RAG buildouts. We are very responsive and aggressive in implementing 
new features and I would love to hear your likes and dislikes about the system today.

  
Thanks!

Hi all,

In addition to the RAG Techniques repo (6K stars in a month), I'm excited to share a new repo I've been working
 on for a while‚ÄîAI Agents!

It‚Äôs open-source and includes 14 different implementations of AI Agents, along with tutorial
s and visualizations.

This is a great resource for both learning and reference. Feel free to explore, learn, open issue
s, contribute your own agents, and use it as needed. And of course, join our AI Knowledge Hub Discord community to stay

```
I'm currently exploring options how to best give access to a variety of models across various vendors (eg OpenAI, Anthro
pic etc.) to our employees‚Ä¶it's for internal playgrounds, POCs and demos only. No production ready applications should r
un through this. We are in the service business, all our clients have their own models in their VPC, we do not supply th
eir infra.

I came across the concept of LLM gateways that to my understanding give you the ability to control access th
rough proxies and/or synthetic keys.

So far, I came across the following list:

LiteLLM -> Seems legit, I like the Lang
Chain integration  
OpenRouter -> Not sure if it's the right fit tbh  
Kong AI Gateway -> Seems overkill for our interna
l usage  
PortKey AI Gateway -> Seems a bit more advanced than LiteLLM

I'm currently tending for LiteLLM‚Ä¶but wanted to 
check if anyone here as experience/recommendations?

Hey folks! We're super excited to share our first release of PremSQL, an open-source library that helps developers creat
e secure, local text-to-SQL solutions with small language models. We‚Äôve been working hard to make building and deploying
 these pipelines way less cumbersome, focusing on customizable components that make sense for secure, AI-driven data ana
lysis.

We‚Äôre also introducing Prem-1B-SQL, a 1B parameter model fine-tuned from DeepSeek Coder 1B, specifically for Tex
t-to-SQL tasks. It's designed to be lightweight and easy to fine-tune your data, so you‚Äôre not stuck relying on closed L
LMs with all the compliance headaches. We‚Äôll be sharing public benchmarks soon, but early results are looking really sol
id.

Some features we‚Äôre stoked about:

* **PremSQL Datasets**: Pre-processed, hosted on HuggingFace‚Äîperfect for evaluat
ion and fine-tuning.
* **Generators & Executors:** Go from input to SQL to execution effortlessly.
* **Evaluators: Metri
cs** like execution accuracy and Valid Efficiency Score (VES) to keep things on track.
* **Error Handling Datasets**: Th
ese are used to build more resilient models that handle errors gracefully.
* **Tuner:** Fine-tune your models with custo
m evaluation‚Äîcontrol the whole training flow!

I would love to hear what the community thinks, and if you find it useful
, a ‚≠êÔ∏è would mean the world. Dive in, explore, and let‚Äôs build cool stuff together!

```
Hey folks,

I read an interesting blog post about DSPy the other day. It's a framework that changes how we work with AI,
 and I thought some of you might find it useful.

The main idea is pretty cool: instead of spending hours tweaking promp
ts, you focus on building the overall flow of your AI program. You set up some metrics to measure what good output looks
 like, and DSPy handles the rest.

A few things stood out to me:

1. It works with different AI models, so you're not lo
cked into one.
2. It breaks big tasks into smaller pieces.
3. It optimizes stuff automatically.

The post talks about ho
w a company called Zoro UK is using DSPy to handle product data from hundreds of suppliers. Sounds like it's helping the
m deal with messy, real-world data.

There's also some talk about how DSPy might help cut costs when you're running AI a
t a large scale.

If you're building AI apps, especially for production, it might be worth a look.

all -  [ Build a RAG based Chatbot for a workplace ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1fd9hbg/build_a_rag_based_chatbot_for_a_workplace/) , 2024-09-11-0912
```
 I am currently working as a research engineer in our department.

As a graduate, my research major was in spatial datab
ase computing and query optimizations in the department of AI.

My ex-boss hired me due to the face that I was from AI d
epartment, and he wanted to do some AI based project. Short-story: He quit the office.

So the temporary boss is asking 
me to come up with a new AI based project as we are almost completing a management system. 

Hence, there's no new proje
ct in our company. Me being the only employee who has basic 

idea on Machine learning and some experience using RAG age
nts. I plan to propose a chat-bot

application as a next research project using the workplace data.

However, I have no 
idea about how to develop a chat-model from the scratch. 

I just have a high-level idea of what I plan to do, which mig
ht be planning totally wrong.

I have no idea what devices, computing power, should I use that could run opensource LLM 


models with good performance. How I can scale it so that many users 'employee' could use it

at a same time. How do I 
fine-tune the model using the custom dataset.

How should I get the custom dataset? From where I should extract and how 
should I extract, what format should it be in?

These things are really overwhelming to me. Thus I want to get the sugge
stions and information from this community.

I hope to get good response.

[https://unstract.com/blog/comparing-approaches-for-using-llms-for-structured-data-extraction-from-pdfs/](https://unstra
ct.com/blog/comparing-approaches-for-using-llms-for-structured-data-extraction-from-pdfs/)

**We‚Äôll show two approaches 
in this article:**

* In the first one, we‚Äôll employ¬†[Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/), the popular Python-based L
LM framework in combination with the Pydantic library to use an LLM to create structured output.
* In the second approac
h, we‚Äôll use¬†[an open-source platform, Unstract,](https://github.com/Zipstack/unstract)¬†which is purpose-built for struc
tured document data extraction. Unstract features Prompt Studio, a prompt engineering environment specialized for what w
e‚Äôre trying to achieve‚Äîdocument data extraction with LLMs.

Later in the article, once we look in detail into our two ap
proaches of using a regular IDE to do prompt engineering vs. using a specialized environment to do the same, we‚Äôll look 
at these challenges in light of each of those approaches to evaluate how we fared in either case.

all -  [ Proper image recognition for RAG application ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1fcsqm5/proper_image_recognition_for_rag_application/) , 2024-09-11-0912
```
I've been trying to make my RAG app accept images as input. I know how to code the features but can't come up with the w
ay to do it (I don't know how to explain it). So here is what I'm trying to do:

I'm trying to create a RAG app that can
 generate answers based on the context and also able to generate answers based on both the context and the image, if pro
vided. Lets say if a user provides the image of a lion and my RAG app is about biology it should be able to retrieve the
 image, answer the user's question using the context.

My first idea was to pass in the image URL into the response prom
pt (just like context) which is then replaced as a description using a Multi Model and ask the question based on that. T
hen I soon discovered a problem, when I ask a follow up question to the previously provided image it would have no idea 
about what I'm talking about because the description is no longer being provided in the response template  prompt.   
  

Another potential issue is that if I ask a question about the image that is not provided by the Multi Model, it would n
ot be able to respond appropriately nor would it be able to regenerate the description of the image.  
  
Please forgive
 me if there are any mistakes in my English, it is not my first language and I hope you can understand what I've written
.

```
Hey everyone,

I'm working on building a chatbot using LangChain and could really use some help with configuring a few s
pecific components. My goal is to enhance the chatbot's ability to retrieve relevant information and answer complex ques
tions more effectively. Here's what I'm trying to set up:

1. \*\*SelfRAG:\*\* To improve the system's autonomy in retri
eving relevant information and generating responses.
2. \*\*GraphRAG:\*\* To integrate retrieval with knowledge graphs, 
enhancing the ability to answer complex questions.
3. \*\*LangGraph:\*\* To create and manage knowledge graphs that repr
esent relationships between concepts in the loaded documents.

I'm relatively new to these components, and any guidance 
on how to set them up or best practices for using them would be greatly appreciated. Whether it's documentation, tutoria
ls, code examples, or just some tips from your experience, I'd love to hear from you!

Thanks in advance for your help

```
Hey everyone,

I'm working on building a chatbot using LangChain and could really use some help with configuring a few s
pecific components. My goal is to enhance the chatbot's ability to retrieve relevant information and answer complex ques
tions more effectively. Here's what I'm trying to set up:

1. \*\*SelfRAG:\*\* To improve the system's autonomy in retri
eving relevant information and generating responses.
2. \*\*GraphRAG:\*\* To integrate retrieval with knowledge graphs, 
enhancing the ability to answer complex questions.
3. \*\*LangGraph:\*\* To create and manage knowledge graphs that repr
esent relationships between concepts in the loaded documents.

I'm relatively new to these components, and any guidance 
on how to set them up or best practices for using them would be greatly appreciated. Whether it's documentation, tutoria
ls, code examples, or just some tips from your experience, I'd love to hear from you!

Thanks in advance for your help!

We're a small SaaS company looking to incorporate an LLM agent into our product.   
Our goal is to enable the LLM agent

 initiating an order through an API call.

We're interested in knowing if there are any frameworks available that could 
simplify this integration process. Ideally, we're seeking a solution that's easy to implement and will be adaptive to ea
ch app/API update.

Langchain and such are OK, but they don't help me with extracting the APIs and preparing the agent p
rompt according to them, more so, they will probably break each time we do API change

I am not a big fan of langchain. I prefer having things under my control and I feel for simple RAG that runs locally, we
 don't need such overcomplicated libraries. I have been trying to combine sqlite with faiss for the 'retrieval' part. Th
e idea is to add vectors with ids in faiss and then use the same ids in sqlite(id will be the primary key) to store and 
later quickly search corresponding text and metadata based on ids. So, I don't store vectors in sqlite. I would love to 
have feedback(positive and negative) on this approach. Hope, the code is good as a starting point for someone who wants 
to not use langchain or other libraries that I feel are unnecessarily complicated and it is a pain to go through their d
ocs and frequent changes.

```
Just wanted to share a project I've been working on for feedback. I've started building an OSS library called AgentM tha
t introduces a new concept of a 'Micro Agent'. Micro Agents are little agents that surface as functions and they do one 
thing using AI really well. You can think of AgentM as the Lodash of AI. If you just want to add summarization to your a
pp you can do that by just importing two functions so if you want to add a dash of intelligence to an app you can do it 
without the heavy weight of something like LangChain or AutoGen.

The thing I want to share today though is an applicati
on experience called **Pulse** that started out as just a sample for AgentM but is rapidly evolving into much more. Agen
tM Pulse is a webserver that runs on your local machine and it surfaces a website that's 100% generated by AI. And more 
than just being a UI that's generated by AI it's a self modifying UI. You can think of it almost like Claude Artifacts b
ut where the entire UI re-writes itself every time you send a new message. Installation instructions are here and you re
ally just have to give it a try to get a sense for what it's capable of:

[https://www.npmjs.com/package/agentm](https:/
/www.npmjs.com/package/agentm)

You can also see more screenshots of example pages I've created over here:

munity.openai.com/t/installing-and-self-hosting-agentm-pulse/933799](https://community.openai.com/t/installing-and-self-

There are some similarities to websim but there are differences too. For example, Pulse ha
s it's own API's it can leverage for storing objects and generating images using dall-e. Unlike websim, you can use it t
o build real applications that are actually useful. It's easy to setup and all you need is an OpenAI API key to get star
ted (Claude support coming.) Thanks for your time and I look forward to the feedback.

```
I'm building a RAG tool. A big problem I'm having is retrieving ALL relevant data when someone makes a query. For exampl
e, below is my text file, `example.txt`:

    Jake's projects:
    - Build a wall
    - Paint a giraffe

Let's say after
 text splitting & chunking there's 3 chunks; 3 seperate langchain \`Document\` objects, one for each line above. The iss
ue is if the user queries 'Which employee has the project of building a wall?' the oracle will NOT return `Jake` as the 
`Jake's projects` chunk has been separated from `- Build a wall`.

So here's my question: Is it possible to relate Docum
ents such that, for example in the above scenario, when the user makes that query the vectorDB will return `Build a wall
` as it did before, but also will return `Jake's projects:` so this extra context is added and the LLM will thus then kn
ow what to answer with.

I know the Document object not only has `pageContent`, but also a metadata field, but I believe
 during semantic search of the vector db the metadata is not searched (for example I was thinking that if both documents
 had a `source:` field in the metadata, and they had the same source, then they'd both be returned, but during semantic 
search I believe metadata is not considered, it's only used for filtering documents....

Hopefully that makes sense, tha
nks!

```
Hi everyone,

I'm working on generating website content using an LLM, but as many of you may know, generating content in
 one go doesn‚Äôt always yield stable results. Instead, breaking the task into smaller chunks often works better. However,
 this approach tends to create semantic gaps between different parts of the content, which lowers its overall quality.


I was thinking of using Langchain and ChromaDB to store previously generated sections and remind the LLM of these parts 
when generating new sections. For example, I could start by asking the LLM to generate two introductory paragraphs. Then
, I would remind the LLM of these paragraphs when asking it to generate the development section. This way, it can produc
e more relevant and cohesive results that stay aligned with the introduction.

What would be the most efficient way to a
chieve this? Should I focus on prompt engineering (e.g., inserting previous sections directly into the prompt template)?
 Or would a solution like ChromaDB be better suited for this scenario?

Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions
!

```
Hey All,

I'm excited to share my project: a multi-agent chatbot leveraging LangGraph and external tools like Wikipedia,
 Arxiv, and more! The goal is to create a conversational AI that combines the strengths of LLMs and specialized knowledg
e sources.

**Here's the challenge:** 

When a user asks a question, the system generates multiple answers from differen
t sources (LLM and external tools). I want to display the most relevant answer, hiding unnecessary responses.

**Example
:**

User query: 'Hi, How are you?'  
Relevant answer: LLM's response (not Wikipedia's)

To achieve this, I'm considerin
g implementing semantic similarity between the user's query and the generated answers. But is this the most efficient ap
proach?

**Questions:**

1. Does LangChain or LangGraph provide built-in functionality for relevance ranking or filterin
g?
2. Are there alternative methods to semantic similarity for determining relevance?
3. What are some potential pitfall
s or considerations when integrating multiple knowledge sources?

**Technical Details:**

* LangGraph for graph-based co
nversational AI
* External tools: Wikipedia, Arxiv, and potentially more
* LLM: Any model via ChatGroq

If you're experi
enced with chatbot development, NLP, or knowledge graph architectures, I'd love your input!

Share your thoughts, sugges
tions, and expertise!

```
I've been building RAGs for enterprises (banks, hospitals, lawyers) for the past \~2 years, and have been talking to som
e members of our community and it seems everybody has the same problem when building RAGs: **How the hell do we parse ou
r data correctly?**

I feel this paint everyday at my job. Reality is that real world data is super messy, real document
s are filled with graphs, tables, diagrams, and even ones that are pure text like legal documents have specific formatti
ng that makes it really hard to extract text correctly using OCR, Unstructured, etc. I have even tried most private data
 extraction solutions like Azure Document Intelligence, GCP Document AI, IBM WatsonX Discovery, and they weren't good en
ough.

Ironically a good example of this is the transformers paper, here are some images from it:

https://preview.redd.
it/j345liy5qlnd1.png?width=322&format=png&auto=webp&s=869e05cd23bb0e1ff15d16db0c8fd29044733501

l18h9qlnd1.png?width=503&format=png&auto=webp&s=592931b1858c26ff04a87fbf847dd40b30ca5e93

No tool I've tried I has been 
parse to parse this information into text correctly. And this is just one average document. I have clients with thousand
 of documents filled with tables and pictures like these. In the end a lot of these cases needed to involve manual label
ing or extraction which is just not scalable. But why are real documents so convoluted?

Because humans are visual. One 
picture is worth a thousand words. By trying to turn our documents into text we lose so much information it crazy, but t
here is an answer:

**Instead of trying to transform human documents into something LLMs understand, we should make LLMs
 understand documents the way humans do.**

All the new models (gpt4o, gemini, claude) are now multimodal, so they have 
the ability to see these pages like we do, and they are actually really great at interpreting them. The problem for RAG 
was that we need to search the right pages to show the model for a specific question, which was difficult... until ColPa
li was released.

**ColPali** is an embedding model trained on documents pages, so you give it an image of a page and it
 gives you an embedding you can store in a vector db related to that page. On top of that, it generates ColBERT embeddin
gs which contain much more detail that vector embeddings.

While it's still an *very* new idea I have been excited to tr
y it out with my projects. So I built [Midras](https://github.com/ajac-zero/midrasai), an Open Source python library tha
t let's you set up ColPali in your own applications, completely free locally or using cloud GPUs with my micro-saas API.
 Using Midras you are able to ingest a pdf file directly and query it, without any preprocessing! You can check out an e
xample notebook of RAG with ColPali and Gemini Flash [here](https://github.com/ajac-zero/midrasai/blob/main/examples/vec
tor_search/vector_search.ipynb).

It's still early days for this new way of visual RAG, so there will be many problems t
o solve along the way. However I think it's the right path for the future of RAG. I intend to use this method for my own
 enterprise projects, so my aim is to make Midras as production ready as possible, while still keeping it open source an
d flexible so you can adapt it to your specific needs.

If you're interested, please give it a star! If you want a speci
fic feature (like support for a specific vector database) please submit an issue!

I also want to learn about more real 
use cases for RAG, so if you have or are working on one, my DMs are open and I would love to talk. Let's push RAG forwar
d together!

```
Hey everyone,

I'm working on building a complex agent using LangChain, aiming to fetch student data from a database and
 create their academic profiles. I was able to get this working using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4 (via the `create_openai_tools_agent
`), but I‚Äôve been running into some issues when switching to Gemini 1.5 Flash and experimenting with tool calling agents
.

# What I‚Äôve Done So Far:

* I successfully set up the agent with GPT-4, where it first retrieves the student data and
 then constructs an academic profile from it.
* Now, I‚Äôm trying to replicate this setup using the Gemini 1.5 Flash model
 with tool calling, but I'm encountering a couple of challenges.

# The Issues:

1. **Tool Order Not Respected:** Despit
e specifying in the tool description that the agent should first fetch the data and then create the profile, it skips di
rectly to the profile creation step. This seems to happen regardless of how I phrase the tool instructions.
2. **Errors 
with Complex Queries:** For more complex tasks, like fetching data for two students and comparing their profiles, the ag
ent throws a `400 error`. Here‚Äôs a snippet of the error I‚Äôm getting:google.api\_core.exceptions.InvalidArgument: 400 \* 
GenerateContentRequest.contents\[3\].parts\[0\].function\_response.name: Name cannot be empty.

This happens when I atte
mpt to retrieve the data for two students (e.g., `Ana` and `Bianca`) and compare their profiles.

# What‚Äôs Next?

After 
sorting this out, I‚Äôd like to test the agent with other models like LLaMA and Mistral, but first, I need to figure out t
he tool-calling order and the error with more complex queries.

Has anyone faced similar issues with Gemini 1.5 Flash or
 have any tips on how to resolve this? Any insights on how to better handle tool calling in LangChain or best practices 
for agent workflows would be super helpful!

8. Using mongoengine currently as a ORM. If you know 
something better please suggest.
9. Using all-miniLM-l6-v2 as vector embedding currently but planning to use stella_en_4
00M_v5.
10. Using cosine similarity to retrieve the documents.
11. Using BLEU, F1 and BERT score for automated evaluatio
n based on golden answer.
12. Using top_k as 3.
13. Currently using basic question answering prompt but want to improve 
it. Any tips? Also heard about Automatic Prompt Evaluation.
14. Currently using custom code for everything. Looking to u
se Llamaindex or Langchain for this. 
15. Right now I am not using any AI Agent, but I want to know your opinions. 
16. 
It's a simple RAG framework and I am working on improving it.
17. I haven't included reranker but I am planning to do so
 too.

I think I mentioned pretty much everything I am using for my project. So please share your suggestions, comments

Are Agents just simple rules? Are Agents just enhanced reasoning? The answer is yes and no. Yes, in the sens
e that agents have simple rules and can sometimes enhance reasoning capabilities compared to a single prompt. But No in 
the sense that agents can have a much more diverse functionality like using specific tools, summarizing, or even followi
ng a particular style. In this blog, we look into how to set up these agents in a hierarchal manner just like running a 
small team of Authors, researchers, and supervisors.

**TextGrad
**. It is a powerful framework performing automatic ‚Äúdifferentiation‚Äù via text.¬†**It backpropagates textual feedback pro
vided by LLMs to improve individual components of a compound AI system.**¬†In this framework, LLMs provide rich, general,
 natural language suggestions to optimize variables in computation graphs, ranging from code snippets to molecular struc
tures. TextGrad showed effectiveness and generality across various applications, from question-answering and molecule op
timization to radiotherapy treatment planning.

guys/textgrad-controlling-llm-behavior-via-text-2a82e2073d10?sk=3633a9aa63b884c97469bce659265921)

The addition of RAG t
o LLMs was an excellent idea. It helped the LLMs to become more specific and individualized. Adding new components to an
y system leads to more interactions and its own sets of problems. Adding RAG to LLMs leads to several problems such as h

In this blog, we are going to combine the
¬†**LangChain RAG with DSPy**. We deep dive into how to evaluate the RAG pipeline quantitatively using¬†**RAGAs**¬†and how 
to create a system where instead of manually tweaking prompts, we let the system figure out the best prompt.

As the field of natural language processing (NLP) advances, the evaluation of large language
 models (LLMs) like GPT-4 becomes increasingly important and complex. Traditional metrics such as accuracy are often ina
dequate for assessing these models‚Äô performance because they fail to capture the nuances of human language. In this arti
cle, we will explore why evaluating LLMs is challenging and discuss effective methods like BLEU and ROUGE for a more com
prehensive evaluation.

# AI Act enters into force

On 1 August 2024, th
e European Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) enters into force. The Act aims to foster responsible artificial intelli
gence development and deployment in the EU. The AI Act introduces a uniform framework across all EU countries, based on 
a forward-looking definition of AI and a risk-based approach:

* **Minimal risk:**¬†most AI systems such as spam filters 
and AI-enabled video games face no obligation under the AI Act, but companies can voluntarily adopt additional codes of 
conduct.
* **Specific transparency risk:**¬†systems like chatbots must clearly inform users that they are interacting wit
h a machine, while certain AI-generated content must be labelled as such.
* **High risk:**¬†high-risk AI systems such as 
AI-based medical software or AI systems used for recruitment must comply with strict requirements, including risk-mitiga
tion systems, high-quality of data sets, clear user information, human oversight, etc.
* **Unacceptable risk:**¬†for exam
ple, AI systems that allow ‚Äúsocial scoring‚Äù by governments or companies are considered a clear threat to people‚Äôs fundam
ental rights and are therefore banned.

# California AI bill SB-1047 sparks fierce debate, Senator likens it to ‚ÄòJets vs. Sharks‚Äô feud


**Key Aspects of SB-1047:**

* Regulation Scope: Targets ‚Äúfrontier‚Äù AI models, defined by their immense computational t
raining requirements (over 10¬≤‚Å∂ operations) or significant financial investment (>$100 million).
* Compliance Requiremen
ts: Developers must implement safety protocols, including the ability to immediately shut down, cybersecurity measures, 
and risk assessments, before model deployment.
* Whistleblower Protections: Encourages reporting of non-compliance or ri
sks by offering protection against retaliation.
* Safety Incident Reporting: Mandates reporting AI safety incidents with
in 72 hours to a newly established Frontier Model Division.
* Certification: Developers need to certify compliance, pote
ntially under penalty of perjury in earlier drafts, though amendments might have altered this.

**Pros:**

* Safety Firs
t: Prioritizes the prevention of catastrophic harms by enforcing rigorous safety standards, potentially safeguarding aga
inst AI misuse or malfunction.
* Incentivizes Responsible Development: By setting high standards for AI model training, 
the company encourages developers to think critically about the implications of their creations.
* Public Trust: Enhance
s public confidence in AI by ensuring transparency and accountability in the development process.

**Cons:**

* Innovati
on Stagnation: Critics argue it might stifle innovation, especially in open-source AI, due to the high costs and regulat
ory burdens of compliance.
* Ambiguity: Some definitions and requirements might be too specific or broad, leading to leg
al challenges or unintended consequences.
* Global Competitiveness: There‚Äôs concern that such regulations could push AI 
development outside California or the U.S., benefiting other nations without similar restrictions.
* Implementation Chal
lenges: The practicalities of enforcing such regulations, especially the ‚Äúpositive safety determination,‚Äù could be compl
ex and contentious.

# MORE OpenAI drama

OpenAI co-founder John
 Schulman has left the company to join rival AI startup Anthropic, while OpenAI president and co-founder Greg Brockman i
s taking an extended leave until the end of the year. Schulman, who played a key role in creating the AI-powered chatbot
 platform ChatGPT and led OpenAI‚Äôs alignment science efforts, stated his move was driven by a desire to focus more on AI
 alignment and hands-on technical work. Peter Deng, a product manager who joined OpenAI last year, has also left the com
pany. With these departures, only three of OpenAI‚Äôs original 11 founders remain: CEO Sam Altman, Brockman, and Wojciech 
Zaremba, lead of language and code generation.

deeplearning -  [ Creating a project on NLP ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1ey2e85/creating_a_project_on_nlp/) , 2024-09-11-0912
```
So me and my friend completed the ML and DL specialization by AndrewNg, and were just gonna get started on a project. We
 decided to make a academic assistant. So basically what this does is a user can upload a PDF,text file or any other sup
ported media and the can ask questions related to it's contents. The main objective being making learning quick given la
rger documents.

The pipeline we decided is pretty standard for such a project.

1. Split the text into chunks
2. Genera
te embeddings of the chunks
3. Store the chunks in a vector DB
4. Find the top K similar chunks to the query 
5. Retriev
e context and feed it into a LLM for an answer.

So I looked up for a library and framework to use and decided on langch
ain. We haven't decided on an LLM yet but want to run it locally so no OpenAI please. 

Since this is gonna be out first
 AI project confidence is low. I would really appreciate any heads up on the issues we may face, any suggestions on libr
aries,frameworks or models will be really helpful as well. 

Appreciate any resourceful comment üòä
