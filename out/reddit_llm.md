Hey Reddit,

I'm working on a tool to pull data from highly irregular Excel files. I've gotten reasonable results which
 is extremely fast with standard Python coding, but it's far from perfect due to the lack of standardized templates. 

I
nterestingly, when I tested ChatGPT-4 on a sample table, it did a decent job at data extraction. However, relying solely
 on GPT-4 has its downsides like token limits and slow processing speed (and data privacy issues). Plus, splitting the E
xcel sheet to fit within these limits results in loss of context and data.

I'm considering fine-tuning a language model
 to post-process data that was in a Pandas DataFrame (perhaps converted to JSON). Has anyone had success with this appro
ach or have alternative recommendations? I've tried Langchain, but it wasn't helpful.

I have figured out to extract the
 relevant columns, but the post-processing part is where I am considering using an LLM which understands the domain and 
what needs to be extracted based on the examples I feed it.

Looking forward to your thoughts! And would be happy to ans
wer any additional questions.

```
üì¢ I'm excited to introduce **BondAI**, an AI Agent framework and CLI, with a lightweight yet robust API making integrati
on into your own applications straightforward and easy.

**Repository:** [**https://github.com/krohling/bondai**](https:
//github.com/krohling/bondai)

# ‚ö°Ô∏èExamples

Here's an example of buying/selling Stocks with [Alpaca Markets](https://al
paca.markets/). I strongly recommend using Paper Trading btw!

    from bondai import Agent 
    from bondai.tools.alpac
a_markets import (
        CreateOrderTool, 
        GetAccountTool, 
        ListPositionsTool
    )
    
    task = (

        'I want you to sell off all of my existing positions.'
        'Then I want you to buy 10 shares of NVIDIA with 
a limit price of $456.'
    )
    
    Agent(tools=[   CreateOrderTool(),   GetAccountTool(),   ListPositionsTool() ]).r
un(task) 

[**Here's an example**](https://github.com/krohling/bondai/tree/main/examples/online-research) of BondAI doin
g online research and [**here's a home automation example**](https://github.com/krohling/bondai/tree/main/examples/home-
automation).

# üîç What is BondAI?

**BondAI** is a framework crafted for the smooth integration and customization of Con
versational AI Agents. Leveraging the power of OpenAI's [**function calling support**](https://openai.com/blog/function-
calling-and-other-api-updates), it sidesteps the hurdles often encountered in building a Conversational Agent, offering 
solutions such as:

* Memory management
* Error handling
* Integrated semantic search
* A rich array of pre-existing too
ls
* Ease of crafting custom tools

Moreover, it offers a **CLI interface** that promises an impressive command line age
nt experience, available to anyone with an OpenAI API Key!

# üèóÔ∏è Why build BondAI?

I am convinced that AI agents are go
ing to be an important architecture for the future of AI. Despite their phenomenal problem-solving abilities, the existi
ng tooling often fell short in performing simple tasks, and the frameworks appeared unnecessarily complicated. This spur
red the birth of **BondAI**, aiming to address these shortcomings and offer a more optimized environment for agent imple
mentations.

I am keen on hearing your feedback on **BondAI**'s functionality and any suggestions for improvements!

# üõ†
Ô∏è Installation & Usage

Get started with BondAI with a simple: pip install bondaiThe CLI tool offers a ready-to-use agen
t experience packed with several default tools. You can also integrate it with various tools such as Google Search, Alpa
ca Markets, and LangChain Tools to execute a myriad of tasks effectively. Detailed guides and examples for usage are ava
ilable in the README.

# üîß APIs and Custom Tools

The BondAI framework offers flexible APIs to build your agent and crea
te custom tools for a personalized experience. It follows a straightforward implementation approach, making the tool cre
ation process hassle-free for developers.

Examples of included Tools:

* Google and Duck Duck Go Search
* Semantic Sear
ch for Files and Websites
* Alpaca Markets
* Gmail Integration
* Easily import tools from LangChain!

# üêã Docker Contain
er

For a secure environment, especially while using tools with file system access, running **BondAI** within a docker c
ontainer is highly recommended. Follow the steps in the REAME to easily build and run the **BondAI** container.

üöÄ Join 
the mission; contribute to BondAI! And please share feedback/ideas in the comments!

all -  [ Editing specific sections of documents? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/16fdr8r/editing_specific_sections_of_documents/) , 2023-09-11-0910
```
Are there any pipelines or perhaps a Langchain chain that would allow me to use an LLM to identify and edit specific por
tions/sections of a document based on a query? 

I understand I can have the document indexed using an abrupt character 
split of a set number of characters, and edit the relevant chunk and re-append to the document, however if the content t
hat is to be edited is spread across two chunks, I would end up having to regenerate both those chunks and re-appending 
to the original document. However I don't know how to include the context of the previous chunk to have a smooth continu
ation into the 2nd chunk.

Hence my question, is there any implementation for this? Or a simpler, better approach that I
 am missing? Any resources or help is greatly appreciated.

Hi! I would like to set a range and/or limit/offset while doing vector queries, so that instead of fetching the top n re

This seems to be a supported function in several o

```
Hello fellow LangChainers,

I'm leveraging FAISS for my vector store and I'm curious about the optimal query length to r
etrieve pertinent documents. My goal is to develop an app that succinctly summarizes business reports tailored to specif
ic roles within a company. For instance, imagine a Head of Finance who prefers a concise overview rather than reading an
 entire report.

To form my query, I've been incorporating the job responsibilities of the target persona. However, I'm 
concerned that my query might be too extensive, leading to less relevant results.   


**Query** (that goes into FAISS v
ia similarity\_search\_with\_score method):

    
Based on the target persona's responsibilities, extract insights from 
a company's annual report.
    Target Persona: Head of Finance, a key figure in the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), who
 emphasizes financial reporting, risk management, and compliance. They play a crucial role in guiding the company's fina
ncial direction, ensuring adherence to regulations, and building relationships with external entities.
    Key Responsib
ilities:
    Overseeing organizational financial reporting, encompassing monthly summaries, budget projections, long-ter
m financial plans, and mandatory reports.
    Offering robust financial guidance to the ELT for informed business decisi
ons.
    Presenting financial outcomes and insights to the Board.
    Central to shaping the company's strategy.
    Sup
ervising the company's tax matters, collaborating with external tax consultants when needed.
    Managing company cash f
low and implementing appropriate treasury controls.

**Given the above, any insights on how I can optimize my query for 
better results in FAISS would be greatly appreciated!**

Hi there, this question is not going to be highly technical, but I'm rather seeking some guidance from more experienced 
developers regarding to career decisions.  


I started learning code roughly 6 months ago after I quit my COO role at s
tart up. Long story short today, I am able to launch a full stack application, I know how Client/Server Components work,
 I understand API, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Auth, OpenAI, Langchain Functions, Streaming etc. etc. etc.  


This is the a
pp that roughly present my skills: [copycopter.ai](https://copycopter.ai) 

&#x200B;

**Now the problem is, I don't real
ly know what to do next.**  
My dream would be learn further and build more, so that at some point, I can make money fro
m my own things. For now, however, I struggle to find people interested in my SaaS, so I probably have some work to do i
n terms of 'go to market' and 'PMF'.  


I could look for a job as a developer, but the only thing I know is NextJS App 
Router and I feel like I'm not yet ready to get a reasonably paid job as a dev. On the other hand, I see so many people 
that create much worse products yet they openly talk about the readiness to get employed.  


I have a lot of experience
 in no code, process automation, Zappier, operations management etc. so I could bring good value to any startup.   


**
What would you do if you were me?** I'm kina struggling to find the right path now.  
**What to learn next? What kind of
 jobs should I seek for?**

. Anything beyond takes multiple minutes. Model's file size is only 4,06 GB. Any other 7 billion params quantized model 
such as LLama2 has same issues. Do I anything wrong since GGML is here to allow models to run on consumer hardware witho
ut GPU? Can I speed up the model? 

    from langchain import CTransformers
    
    llm = CTransformers(
        model=
'path to model',
        model_type='falcon',
        config={

I've just started with LLMs and LangChain, but I really need some help to understand the key concepts around RAG. I've r
ead it reduces the risk of hallucinations using your data, so I've been trying to build a basic prototype myself. I've e
nded up copying the code from [https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/ollama](https://python.langchain.com/
docs/integrations/llms/ollama), this is what I've got:

    llm = Ollama(
     base_url='http://localhost:11434',
     m
odel='llama2',
     callback_manager=CallbackManager([StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()]),
      )
    
    loader = WebB
aseLoader('https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/')
    data = loader.load()
    text_splitter = Recursive
CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=100, chunk_overlap=50)
    all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data)
    
    
 
   vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(
     documents=all_splits, embedding=HuggingFaceEmbeddings()
     )

m langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
    prompt_template = '''Use the following pieces of context to answer the que
stion at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer. Only use p
rovided context, don't try to generate an answer based on assumptions.

    QA_CHAIN_PROMPT = PromptTemplate(

    chain_type_kwargs = {'prompt': QA_CHAIN_PROMPT}
    qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type

ROMPT}
    )
    
    question = 'What are the various approaches to Task Decomposition for AI Agents?'
    result = qa_
chain({'query': question})

After unsuccessful experiments I even use the original web source and the question from the 
example in the documentation. But the output is rather disappointing (lots of hallucinations, perhaps coming from pre-tr
aining datasets, no information coming from the linked web page): 

>Based on the provided context, there are several ap
proaches to task decomposition for AI agents. Here are some of them:

>2. Goal-based decomposition: The agent can de
compose a task into smaller subgoals based on its goals. For example, if the goal is to make a cup of coffee, the subgoa
ls could be 'obtain coffee beans,' 'boil water,' 'use coffee filter,' etc.  
>  
>3. Workflow-based decomposition: The a
gent can decompose a task into smaller subgoals based on a workflow or a series of steps involved in completing the task
. For example, if the task is to organize a trip, the subgoals could be 'book flight tickets,' 'make hotel reservations,
' 'plan itinerary,' etc.  
>  
>4. Hybrid approach: The agent can use a combination of goal-based and workflow-based dec
omposition to break down large tasks into smaller subgoals. For example, the agent can use goals to determine the overal
l task and then break it down into smaller subgoals based on a workflow.  
>  
>5. Machine learning-based approaches: Th
ere are various machine learning-based approaches to task decomposition, such as using neural networks to learn patterns
 in data or using reinforcement learning to learn how to break down tasks into smaller subgoals.

&#x200B;

I'm lost at 
this point, I thought using retriever=vectorstore.as\_retriever(), should have enforced using the source and only it as 
the context? Is there a mistake in the code or am I misunderstanding how it should work?

Thanks in advance for any advice!  


I'm applying for A) product manager, and B) product marketing manager jobs. (Somet
imes 'Senior' level, sometimes not). I have generally worked in 'tech' over my previous recent roles, but my experience 
is kind of a grab bag.  


I'm definitely stretching my qualifications a bit to land a tech PM/PMM role. Worth noting th
at I've done a lot of projects involving AI recently because that's a particular area of interest and often where I'm ap
plying.  


Issues I know I have to overcome:  


* Weird / small companies on my resume. I've started a couple companie
s and my recent work experiences aren't at 'known' companies. 
* I come off too senior (?). Since I've founded a couple 
companies, I have things like 'CEO' on my resume. But of a 15 person company... Nonetheless, I've been told before that 
hiring managers were worried I wouldn't be 'satisfied with the level of responsibility in this role.'
* I'm currently un
employed. I tried to remedy this by (truthfully) saying I've been doing self employed work. However, I don't know if I'm
 describing this correctly or whether it's even helpful to have that on here.

My main questions are:

&#x200B;

1. Are 
there any noticeable things I might consider changing to address the issues outlined above? (Or other issues you perceiv
e?)
2. Should I have an Overview section at all? What about the self employed Experience?  


Thanks again!

```
I am unsure if this is the right sub to ask such a question I'll try my best to provide as much context of my issue.

I 
am currently a IT Researcher looking at using RAG Models for document question and answering. I am working with Multiple
 500+ Page documents filled with charts, numbers, and text. We use these documents to record and track information in sp
readsheets. The current workflow is using a small team to go through the documents manually looking for the information 
they need to record in their sheets. The documents are too big to use a Ctrl + F keyword search so I was looking at RAG 
Models to make searching through these documents more effective.

I have been using ThirdAI's Pocket LLM (open to try al
ternative or open source RAG Models) to try to test the effectiveness of such a strategy but I have had issues properly 
prompting/searching for what I want. I have no problem building my own RAG Model using langchain I am just wondering if 
this is the best route for such an issue. Data privacy is not a concern because the documents we will be using are publi
cly available information. Data accuracy however is pretty important so I was wondering if hallucination is a factor whe
n dealing with RAG models.

It's fine if embeddings are expensive. Automating this process is far more valuable. Thanks 
for any insight or feedback and I will be happy to clarify anything just ask.

Hey y'all,

I wanted to put my ReAct agent on Streamlit. Thank you for the recommendations, btw, that was exactly what I
 was looking for.

The problem that I have is that the agent pipes the feedback into the shell but not the screen. Docum
entation doesn't really help.

Here is my agent definition

    llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model_name='gpt-3.5-turb
o')
    tools = load_tools(['human', 'serpapi', 'llm-math'], llm=llm)

                You have access to the following tools:'''
    suffix = '''Begin!'

    
    {chat_history}
    Question: {input}
    {agent_scratchpad}'''
    
    output_parser = CustomOutputParser()
 
   prompt = ZeroShotAgent.create_prompt(
        tools,
        prefix=prefix,
        suffix=suffix,
        input_vari
ables=['input', 'chat_history', 'agent_scratchpad'],
    )
    memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key='chat_histor
y')
    llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)
    agent = ZeroShotAgent(llm_chain=llm_chain, tools=tools, verbose
=True, output_parser=output_parser)
    agent_chain = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(
        agent=agent, tools=too
ls, verbose=True, memory=memory
    )

Here is the streamlit part

    if prompt := st.chat_input('What is up?'):
      
  st.session_state.messages.append({'role': 'user', 'content': prompt})
        with st.chat_message('user'):
          
  st.markdown(prompt)
    
        with st.chat_message('assistant'):
            message_placeholder = st.empty()
     
       full_response = ''
            for response in agent_chain.run(st.session_state.messages):
                full_r
esponse += response.choices[0].delta.get('content', '')
                message_placeholder.markdown(full_response + '‚ñå'
)
            message_placeholder.markdown(full_response)
        st.session_state.messages.append({'role': 'assistant',
 'content': full_response})

What I want is that if the app queries 'human' it should pop the question to the chat inter
face.

all -  [ Chains and Agents ](https://www.reddit.com/r/aiengineer/comments/16d7fh4/chains_and_agents/) , 2023-09-11-0910
```
I think there's a lot of confusion around AI agents today and it's mainly because of lack of definition and using the wr
ong terminology.

We've been talking to many companies who are claiming they're working on agents but when you look unde
r the hood, they are really just chains.

I just listened to the Latent Space pod with¬†Harrison Chase (Founder of Langch
ain) and I really liked how he thinks about chains vs agents.

Chains: sequence of tasks in a more rigid order, where yo
u have more control, more predictability.  
Agents: handling the edge-cases, the long-tail of things that can happen.

A
nd the most important thing is that it's not an OR question but an AND one: you can use them in the same application by 
starting with chains -> figuring our the edge-cases -> using agents to deal with them.

I think there's a lot of confusion around AI agents today and it's mainly because of lack of definition and using the wr
ong terminology.

We've been talking to many companies who are claiming they're working on agents but when you look unde
r the hood, they are really just chains.

I just listened to the Latent Space pod with¬†Harrison Chase (Founder of Langch
ain) and I really liked how he thinks about chains vs agents.

Chains: sequence of tasks in a more rigid order, where yo
u have more control, more predictability.  
Agents: handling the edge-cases, the long-tail of things that can happen.

A
nd the most important thing is that it's not an OR question but an AND one: you can use them in the same application by 
starting with chains -> figuring our the edge-cases -> using agents to deal with them.

```
Hello, i'm  very new to langchain so i wonder if you can give me your opinion on a problem and hopefully suggest me a po
tential solution. 

I'm trying to mimic a common  chatgpt usage. I would like to provide the LLM with a list of words as
king the AI to classify them based on instructions contained in the prompt. The problem is that the list of words  can b
e extremely huge and go over the limit provided by the model (gpt-3.5-turbo-16k)

I initially created the list of word i
n a single document that i split in chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

&#x200B;

At the moment i adopted this
 workflow:

ChatOpenAI -> evaluate prompt with the first chunk of context -> provide partial result

ChatOpenAI -> evalu
ate prompt with the second chunk of context -> provide partial result

...

ChatOpenAI -> evaluate prompt with the last 
chunk of context -> provide partial result

When i get the last partial result i merge them together to get a single pan
das dataframe. 

I wonder if this could be the right approach or there are more streamlined approach that langchain alre
ady offers. What i put in place is prone to many problems (for example the length of prompt+context can still be too lon
g and provide an incomplete response)

Thanks

```
I've now tried quite a few **chatgpt plugins** which are supposed to analyze pdfs, as well as writing my own custom **la
ngchain based bots** to query documents built from large unstructured pdfs. I am still very unhappy with both my custom 
as well as the 'professional' solutions. They all seem to be able to recall single or multiple details from texts quite 
easily, but totally **uncapable of dealing with more complex questions**. My understanding is, that this is because of t
wo reasons: 

1. **Complex layout of unstructured data:** Even a single pdf page can have many types of data, in the for
m of images, tables, flowcharts, text blocks with multilevel bullets etc. This often makes it much more easy for a human
 to understand, but using pdf loaders provided by langchain or even more sophisticated toolkits (layout-parser) results 
in lots of different document elements, which the llm does not seem to able to connect in a meanigful way
2. **No hierac
hical context of the document:** A human is able to immediately understand a lot of context just by having seen the cove
r page, toc and then looking at a page, like understanding what kind of document it is, which section the current page i
s a part of and so on. A human will intuitively understand if they have to read an entire section to answer a question o
r just find a specific page. A bot will not

Since I'm not an expert in the field I just wanted to check if my understan

**Hello,**

**I‚Äôd like to implement a semantic search for PDFs or various documents.**

**I‚Äôve been across Faiss and 
I‚Äôve got it to work after a few tries (using LangChain library). At first I had problems since many of the docs were in 
italian but I fixed by switching the sentence transformer from** all-MiniLM-L6-v2 **to** paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-
L12-v2.

The result is far away from perfection, it doesn‚Äôt always find what I‚Äôm looking for and I think the main concer
n is the conversion from PDFs to vectors.

Currently it‚Äôs not taking in count the hierarchy of the document (titles, sub
titles, paragraph), is there a way to do so? Also, is it possible to define a ‚Äúword weight‚Äù to set the priority of some 
words instead of others?

Any best practice or guide is appreciated.

Also, I‚Äôm not sure FAISS can do all the work, mayb
e there are good alternatives such as ElasticSearch?

Thanks in advance

I would like to make scripts playing with local LLMs. I don't want to play with fine tuning or tweak the models (M2 prob
ably can't handle it, plus it is incompatible with half the Python AI ecosystem), I just want to type 'how do you feel a
bout this?' and get an answer. I don't even need streaming, all I want is to get the answer. I don't need tokens/second,
 anything, just the raw answer.

How would you do this in a Macbook (M2 Max - 32GB)?

I thought about

\- Invoking llama
.cpp process from terminal, programmatically (maybe too much work? This also wouldn't be versatile)

\- Grab something l
ike Dalai that makes a web server from llama.cpp, then I can switch between OpenAI and my local GPT which would call a l
ocal server?

\- Is there an even better way?

Probably NodeJS would be easier, but if there is a trick on Python, I'm o
pen too. All I could find was tutorials on how to fine tune, not exactly run the standard model via Python, which is wha
t I want (from a Macbook, so I can't compile the models in pytorch, I guess). Langchain is not my favorite piece of soft
ware, but if it can do this, I'm fine too.

Hello everyone, 

I'm building an AI application, and one of the biggest issues with it is sometimes GPT-3.5 will give m

 asks it to retry.

There must be a lot of people having this same problem. Is there a python library someones made for 
regexing these errors out, or some other way to reduce the likelyhood of them happening as close to 0% as possible? At t
he moment, these errors are occuring about 10% of the time, and GPT-3.5 corrects them only 2/3rds of that time. That mea
ns that 3% of the time my program is failing which is too high.

Any ideas? I'm open to anything!

Hey, this is a little chat project I set up a while back 
to review embeddings, play with models, and generally diy research for various things. Sharing for fun, feel free to tea
r it apart, or share what you like. I like that it's clean and easy to visualize the process in Colab/ jupyter notebook.
 Chat and everything seems to be working at the time of posting. You'll need your openai key, and deeplake key (here: [A
ctiveloop | Deep Lake | Data Lake for Deep Learning](https://www.activeloop.ai/))

Pipeline notes: HuggingFace embedding
s models are used so they can be swapped to test the individual model performance and chat-output generation. Currently,
 the chat is openai gpt-3.5 modelset because it's easy and reliable for testing prototyping. I've used Activeloop Deepla
ke vector-db because if you're not familiar, once your embeddings are ingested, they have a great visualizer so you can 
see your embeddings, and review each embedding individually if needed. The pipeline is designed to be fun, with lots of 
ways to visualize the outputs as things are being processed. Lots of progress bars and generation totals to show exactly
 what's going on in the print statements. 

Features: 

i. huggingface embeddings model can easily be switched and d/l v
ia model name configuration

ii. embedding models are currently BERT models, distilled just means the original model has
 been reduced by 40% and retains 95%+ of its original performance. 

iii. ingestion speed is currently 3/seconds per pag
e (mildly better with openai embeddings)

iv. paralell processing for the embeddings is possible, but with GPU support i
t's redundant, and with colab-pro you have the oppertunity to create and ingest the embeddings at a 'normal' rate 

v. o
penai gpt-3.5 chat model 

Roadmap:

i. I know the chat sucks, I'm working on an agent to combine various tools. Feel fr
ee to provide your options or opinions on what would work best for vector retrieval 

ii. I'm working with the TensorFlo
w uploader in Langchain, in combination with the DeepLake/ Activeloop performant/compute  loader (which also uses tensor
flow), to increase the speed of embedding ingestion. In preliminart trials, this seems promising, but nothing to roll ou
t for sharing yet.   


Enjoy if you tinker with it. Otherwise, feel free to share your thoughts, opinions, concerns abo
ut the pipeline.

```
Hi there, 

Hoping to get some guidance with how to setup the agent framework for my use case, where I always want a par
ticular tool to run regardless of what is being asked -- like a 'required' tool.

&#x200B;

I have a basic product chat 
bot working for RAG-based QA about a product, retrieving info about the product to help it answer questions.

So if I as
k a question like:

>**'It's going to be 45¬∞F this weekend. Is this jacket appropriate?'**

Then the bot is correctly re
sponding with: (specific response based on the temperature rating of the jacket itself):

>*'Yes, this jacket would be a
ppropriate for a temperature of 45 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature comfort range for this jacket is 40¬∞F - 50¬∞F, so 
it is designed to provide comfort and insulation within that range.'*

  
Now I'm trying to expand the bot to be able to
 answer a question like:

>**'Is this jacket appropriate for the weather in Denver this weekend?'**

&#x200B;

To do thi
s, I setup an  `conversational-react-description` agent that has 2 tools:

* openweathermap-api
* Product Chat: A custom
 tool wrapping the same product chat bot above

&#x200B;

To answer this question, I want the agent to:

1. Lookup the w
eather in Denver this weekend (weather tool)
2. Lookup the product specifications of the jacket (RAG), including tempera
ture rating (product tool)
3. Combine the results of 1 and 2 to say yes or no and explain why

&#x200B;

The problem is,
 it's only running the weather tool, and then providing a generic response that 'yes a a jacket is probably a good idea'
 based on the weather. 

    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    
    Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
    Ac
tion: OpenWeatherMap
    Action Input: Denver,US
    Observation: In Denver,US, the current weather is as follows:
    D
etailed status: broken clouds
    Wind speed: 0.89 m/s, direction: 74¬∞
    Humidity: 22%
    Temperature: 
      - Curre
nt: 28.34¬∞C
      - High: 30.63¬∞C
      - Low: 25.95¬∞C
      - Feels like: 27.03¬∞C
    Rain: {}
    Heat index: None
   
 Cloud cover: 54%
    Thought: Do I need to use a tool? No
    AI: Based on the current weather in Denver, US, it looks 
like a jacket would be appropriate for this weekend. The temperature is currently 28.34¬∞C, with a high of 30.63¬∞C and a 
low of 25.95¬∞C. The humidity is 22%, and the wind speed is 0.89 m/s.
    
    > Finished chain.

&#x200B;

I want every 
response to be in the context of the product, so I always want the product tool to run.

I've tried modifying the agent 
prompt prefix with language like '*You use should always use the 'Product Chat' tool before returning the final answer.'
*, but it has no effect.  


Is there a way to mark a tool as required? Is there a better way to try and instruct the ag
ent about the importance of running the product chat tool?

My colleague just wrote up an article on [LLM-based apps and how to use data engineering tools to help build them faster
](https://meltano.com/blog/llm-apps-are-mostly-data-pipelines/) that I found really insightful.

It contains a complete 
implementation

* with scraping context data from a docs website
* chunking it, getting embeddings via the openAI API
* 
loading it into pinecone
* and finally a simple Q&A interface with streamlit on top of it

**Here's a quick summary:**


* LangChain and LlamaIndex are great tools for quick exploration
* But aren't perfect for production-grade use
* I think
 we all know the 'LangChain is pointless' debate, but there's a lot of real meat to it, and Pat describes a few of them 
(a lot of LangChains extractors are super basic, 2-3 liners without retries etc.)
* LLM applications are all about movin
g data, extracting and enriching data (creating embeddings!) are the most expensive ones of those steps
* A bunch of dat
a engineering tools are out there that make these two steps much easier, versionable, robust, and reproducible.
* Meltan
o is one such tool and Pat implemented the above described pipeline with it

**FWIW**: The GitHub project that comes wit
h the post is super easy to run and super modular. I just tested it and was able to modify everything for my own applica

We've created an open source chat bot builder, on top of PostgresML. This tool makes it easy to ingest documents and set
 a system prompt for a chatbot with knowledge of your content. The innovation is in the simplicity and efficiency, rathe
r than the functionality.

PostgresML runs open source embedding models alongside pgvector in Postgres to implement chat
 bot prompt creation without any network calls, which makes it \~4x faster than competing architectures. It can also do 
text generation with that prompt (and no additional network hops) using any open source model from HuggingFace, but it a
lso integrates with the GPT-4 API if you'd like to use that instead. 

The full writeup including some benchmarks for co
mpeting architectures is here:  [https://postgresml.org/blog/pgml-chat-a-command-line-tool-for-deploying-low-latency-kno
wledge-based-chatbots-part-I](https://postgresml.org/blog/pgml-chat-a-command-line-tool-for-deploying-low-latency-knowle

You can chat with a deployment that has access to our blogs and documentation content it in 
\[our Discord\]([https://discord.com/channels/1013868243036930099/1013868243536072868](https://discord.com/channels/1013

&#x200B;

* The source code for 
the bot builder and server is only a few hundred lines of Python [https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/tree/master/p
gml-apps/pgml-chat#readme](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/tree/master/pgml-apps/pgml-chat#readme)
* The chat a
pp is so small, because it's delegates all the vector db and embedding generation options to our Python client SDK, whic
h is available for anyone to build other apps with: [https://pypi.org/project/pgml/](https://pypi.org/project/pgml/)
* T
he Python client SDK is so small, because it's just a wrapper around the Rust client SDK: [https://github.com/postgresml
/postgresml/tree/master/pgml-sdks/rust/pgml](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/tree/master/pgml-sdks/rust/pgml). 
Currently we also support JS/Typescript SDKs as well, all generated from the same safe and efficient underlying Rust imp
lementation, using some fancy Rust macros.
* The Rust client SDK is also pretty simple though, because it just delegates
 everything to the Postgres database extension, which is where everything is computed in a single GPU accelerated proces
s, without having to load any ML models, data, or dependencies on client apps, effectively eliminating all the typical M
L data<->model network hops. Which makes it faster, simpler and safer.

This lays out what we think a is a better approa
ch to AI application architecture compared to libraries like LangChain or LlamaIndex, that focus on glueing together dis
parate data stores, algorithms, models over the network.

```
What are the possible practical approaches to creating an 'AI tutor' for a custom fantasy language, i.e. a language whic
h is definitely not covered in any large, mainstream LLM?

Assume in the fantasy language (like Game of Throne's Dothrak
i, but completely custom, so it's guaranteed not to be covered at all by an existing LLM), we have a dictionary of terms
, and a simple description of a grammar. What can I do with that?

Initially I was thinking of using 'Retrieval-Augmente
d Generation' (RAG), where I would pass it my dictionary of terms and their definitions and the grammar doc (i.e. the so
urce documents), and using OpenAI's LLM and LangChain's API wrapper and Pinecone long-term memory vector database, store
 the dictionary/grammar in Pinecone's vector database. Then a query comes in to translate an English word to a fantasy w
ord, and it looks in the Pinecone DB for similar English words, then passes the results with the fantasy word to the LLM
, along with the query, and generates a nice English response, with the fantasy word somewhere in there.

But that doesn
't seem like it would work the more I think about it. Then if I want to add the ability for it to translate English to t
he fantasy language, that seems impossible without first having a huge corpus of translation material (which is complete
ly impractical for a fantasy language). So can an existing generic LLM take a grammar as input, and learn to speak a fan
tasy language? If so, how would you make that happen?

Or what are other approaches to accomplishing this sort of thing?
