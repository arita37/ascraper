I‚Äôm looking for advice on improving the overall content quality 
of my resume. Does it accurately reflect my skills and work experience? Is there something about the structure or syntax
 that could be holding me back? Any feedback on how to make it stronger would be greatly appreciated, as I feel it‚Äôs the
 main reason I‚Äôm not getting interview opportunities.

There are no visa or citizenship complications in my search.

```
Hello,  
I am a beginner working on an AI project for commercial use, and I‚Äôm currently stuck. I‚Äôve been using three mod
els: Faster-Whisper, LLaMA 3.1 8B, and Parler-TTS. I hooked them up using Hugging Face's `transformers` library. My main
 bottleneck right now is the LLaMA model for real-time responses. I initially used the [shenzhi-wang/Llama3-8B-Chinese-C
hat at v2](https://huggingface.co/shenzhi-wang/Llama3-8B-Chinese-Chat/tree/v2) model (v2 gguf), but it struggled with sp
ecific role-based JSON responses.

I switched to LLaMA 3.1 8B and 3.2 3B while using and testing all of these, and while
 they improved the accuracy of the responses, the speed dropped significantly. The response time is now around 3-4 secon
ds, whereas before it was closer to 0.5 seconds.

I‚Äôve tried performance optimizations from [huggingface-llama-recipes/p
erformance\_optimization at main ¬∑ huggingface/huggingface-llama-recipes](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface-lla
ma-recipes/tree/main/performance_optimization), but haven't seen much improvement. I also encountered a strange error wh
en trying to compile with `torch` (specifically with `model.forward`) and I dont get any with just `model`.

Here‚Äôs my c
urrent setup:

* **Hardware**: NVIDIA 3090 on a Windows PC
* **Goal**: Achieve real-time responses within 1-2 seconds, u
sing all three models. For context, I start streaming audio and compute 2 seconds of audio in 3 sec but I could change m
odel I guess.

I‚Äôm considering the following options, but I‚Äôd love your advice on which approach to prioritize:

1. **Do
ckerize the setup and test on H100 cloud GPUs**, then optimize performance once it works on that infrastructure as I cou
ld use it in future for scaling.
2. **Check out the new gguf version of LLaMA 3.1** (like [shenzhi-wang/Llama3.1-8B-Chin
ese-Chat]()), since the previous gguf model was faster or some others.
3. **Revisit LLaMA-cpp** (not `cpp-python`, since
 I ran into dependency issues). I had a better performance with LLaMA-cpp, but the Docker setup confused me. I shifted t
o `transformers` for model management and download automation, but that has slowed things down. I‚Äôm considering whether 
to switch back or figure out llama-cpp-python.
4. **Experiment with other models like Qwen or Mistral** for specific rol
es (like role-playing), though I‚Äôm unsure if they‚Äôll outperform LLaMA for my use case.
5. **Explore Ollama** for ease of
 use, but I feel LLaMA-cpp might still be better for performance, especially when planning to switch to vLLM or LangChai
n later (although that would require reworking the system, and I‚Äôm short on time).

What would you recommend as the fast
est way to prove these models can achieve real-time responses (around 1-2 seconds sequentially? Any suggestions on impro
ving the performance, especially in a production setting, would be appreciated as I need to figure out everything alone.

```
Hey folks, been messing around with LangChain and LangGraph lately. Thought I'd share my thoughts and see if anyone can 
help clear up some stuff.

The Good Stuff
- Loving the YouTube videos and tutorials. They've been a big help.
- Shout ou
t to Harrison Chase. Dude's commitment to making sense of all this LLM chaos is awesome. Appreciate the transparency too
.
- Loved seeing the Open Canvas codebase as well as the LangChain Chat project, learned so much studying them.

Where I
'm Stuck
1. LangGraph as a Platform: What exactly can I expect from it? Can I use it as my main database for chats and u
sers?

2. Keeping User Data Separate: What's the go-to method for this? Kinda crucial if I want to take this to producti
on.

3. Practical Stuff: Trying to do something simple - generate a thread title after the AI responds, then store it wi
th the thread in my database. Serializing BaseMessages works, but it breaks when I try to get them back. Any tips?

4. R
eal-World Use: Anyone actually running a production app on LangGraph? How's it holding up? Does it scale well?

What's Y
our Take?

If you've been hands-on with LangChain or LangGraph, especially in production, I'd love to hear from you. How
 are you handling data storage and keeping user stuff separate? Any pro tips for building solid, scalable apps with thes
e tools?

 current economy in which we are leaving and my responsabilities as a provider in my home.

ht Mode:** This feature can adapt to system settings or be manually toggled in the UI, providing flexibility in appearan
ce.

**New features that I added:**

1. **Markdown Table Parsing and Display:** Many existing chatbot UI templates strug
gle with cleanly rendering markdown tables, including TurboGPT. My version resolves this, ensuring tables display as nea
tly as they do in OpenAI's UI.
2. **Custom Backend Model Integration:** Most chatbot UIs lack the ability to interact wi
th custom backend models, as these typically require different object classes for communication compared to standard API
 calls. My template includes examples for calling backend models using Flask and Langserve. You can test this by selecti
ng a backend model. Click to visit the [Backend Repo](https://github.com/RaghaRao314159/Convo-UI_backend).
3. **Streamin
g Chatbot Outputs:** While streaming outputs is straightforward with foundation models, it becomes complex when dealing 
with backend servers. After extensive testing, I successfully implemented streaming capabilities for backend models in t
his template. Unfortunately, pythonanywhere voids this and my backend is currently on pythonanywhere. I will move it to 
another server in due time.

ons. Do star this repo so more*** developers ***are aware of tools available to them.***

**More resources on building chatbots**

I have thoroughl
y explored various approaches to building a fully custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM chatbot, and the resul
ts of my work can be found in my [RAG repository](https://github.com/RaghaRao314159/AuditBot_backend). Unlike many other
 online resources, this repository offers a complete full-stack solution for developing a RAG chatbot.

**For Frontend D
evelopers:**

I have included multiple UI options, from simple mockups to production-grade interfaces, along with the ne
cessary code to integrate the frontend with the backend. The chat interface is a React application, similar to this one,
 utilizing LangServe. You can find the frontend code in the [AuditBot repository](https://github.com/RaghaRao314159/Audi
tBot_frontend).

**For Machine Learning Engineers:**

I have conducted extensive experiments to improve the RAG framewor
k, covering techniques such as HyDE, recursive retrieval, and others. Additionally, the repository provides implementati
ons of frameworks like Langchain and LlamaIndex. It also includes setups for data stores, examples of prompt engineering
 with GuardRails, and much more.

all -  [ Whats the best approach to build LLM apps? Pros and cons of each ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1g8fnkd/whats_the_best_approach_to_build_llm_apps_pros/) , 2024-10-23-0912
```
With so many tools available for building LLM apps (apps built on top of LLMs), what's the best approach to quickly go f
rom 0 to 1 while maintaining a production-ready app that allows for iteration?

Here are some options:

1. Direct API Th
in Wrapper / Custom GPT/OpenAI API: Build directly on top of [OpenAI‚Äôs API](https://openai.com/product) for more control
 over your app‚Äôs functionality.
2. Frameworks like [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) / [LlamaIndex](https://llamai
ndex.ai/): These libraries simplify the integration of LLMs into your apps, providing building blocks for more complex w
orkflows.
3. Managed Platforms like [Lamatic](https://lamatic.ai/) / [Dify](https://dify.ai/) / [Flowise](https://flowis
e.io/): If you prefer more out-of-the-box solutions that offer streamlined development and deployment.
4. Editor-like To
ols such as [Wordware](https://wordware.ai/) / [Writer](https://writer.com/) / [Athina](https://athina.ai/): Perfect for
 content-focused workflows or enhancing writing efficiency.
5. No-Code Tools like [Respell](https://respell.ai/) / [n8n]
(https://n8n.io/) / [Zapier](https://zapier.com/): Ideal for building automation and connecting LLMs without needing ext
ensive coding skills.

*(Disclaimer: I am a founder of [Lamatic](https://lamatic.ai/), understanding the space and what 
tools people prefer)*

It always seems odd to me that OpenAI doesn't use any chatbots on its site.  Do they not believe in their own product?


Especially for API users, a good chatbot with access to the docs is actually kind of useful.  Langchain does it with [ht
tps://chat.langchain.com/](https://chat.langchain.com/) and, while it's not perfect, I respect them for putting their mo
ney where their mouth is.  Why not OpenAI?

Has anyone managed/ know how to use a placeholder approach (similar to langchains prompts ) which allows a valu

```
I am working on my capstone project, where I developed a contract summarizer and a QA bot using the Llama 3 model and a 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. My dataset consists of contracts from 12 categories (e.g., shipping agreeme
nts, IP agreements), each with 5 PDFs. I need guidance on the following aspects of my journal article:

1. **Method Sele
ction**: Should I continue using the RAG approach, or are there alternative methods I should explore?
2. **Comparative A
nalysis**: To enhance the content of my paper, should I include a comparison of different methods, models, or approaches
? If so, what could I compare?
3. **Evaluation Without Ground Truth**: Since I don't have ground truth data, how can I e
ffectively evaluate my system? Should I use RAG-as-a-Service (RAGas) to generate a test set, or should I employ large la
nguage models (LLMs) as judges?
4. **Enhancing the Journal Article**: What additional components or methods can I incorp
orate to strengthen my paper and make it more comprehensive?
5. **Dataset and Ground Truth Suggestions**: Can you recomm
end other datasets that include ground truth for tasks like mine, or provide advice on how to generate ground truth data
 for evaluation?

1. Load the pdf document into langchain.
PDF is in format - q:

2. Use 'sentence-transformer/all-MiniLM-L6-v2'  for embedding and chroma as vector store

3. Use 'meta-llama/Ll

4. Generate a pipeline and a prompt like 'Answer only from document. If not just say i do

5. Finally use langchain to get top documents, pass the question

```
Dear Developers,

I have created this repository to support your projects. This is not a product but a template that wil
l **ease your workflow**.

Here's the background:

While working on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project, I fo
und that no existing chat UI template offered all the features I needed. In response, I decided to build my own, incorpo
rating those missing functionalities.

Chatbot UI: [https://convo-ui.vercel.app](https://convo-ui.vercel.app)

Repositor
y: [https://github.com/RaghaRao314159/Convo-UI](https://github.com/RaghaRao314159/Convo-UI)

**Key features included in 
both ConvoUI and TurboGPT:**

1. **Multiple Chats/Conversations Support:** While Gradio is great, it only supports a sin
gle active conversation at a time. My template addresses this by storing multiple chats locally (via localStorage) and l
inking them to authentication keys.
2. **Authentication:** The template integrates authentication using OpenAI API keys 
for security and access control.
3. **Dark and Light Mode:** This feature can adapt to system settings or be manually to
ggled in the UI, providing flexibility in appearance.

**New features that I added:**

1. **Markdown Table Parsing and D
isplay:** Many existing chatbot UI templates struggle with cleanly rendering markdown tables, including TurboGPT. My ver
sion resolves this, ensuring tables display as neatly as they do in OpenAI's UI.
2. **Custom Backend Model Integration:*
* Most chatbot UIs lack the ability to interact with custom backend models, as these typically require different object 
classes for communication compared to standard API calls. My template includes examples for calling backend models using
 Flask and Langserve. You can test this by selecting a backend model. Click to visit the [Backend Repo](https://github.c
om/RaghaRao314159/Convo-UI_backend).
3. **Streaming Chatbot Outputs:** While streaming outputs is straightforward with f
oundation models, it becomes complex when dealing with backend servers. After extensive testing, I successfully implemen
ted streaming capabilities for backend models in this template. Unfortunately, pythonanywhere voids this and my backend 
is currently on pythonanywhere. I will move it to another server in due time.



***I hope this template helps you accel
erate the development of your full-stack applications.***

**More resources on building chatbots**

I have thoroughly explored various approaches to 
building a fully custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM chatbot, and the results of my work can be found in my 
[RAG repository](https://github.com/RaghaRao314159/AuditBot_backend). Unlike many other online resources, this repositor

I have a background in time-series analysis and I work for a small company (read: startup) that works on GenAI. As part 
of that, my manager has asked me to produce ASAP a proof-of-concept implementation of an AI agent on large document reco

about a corpus of text that the client uploads.

Specifically, my manager has asked me to look into performing OCR on a 
large document (~200 pages) and uploading it into a Chroma vector store, and implementing a question-answer system with 
an AI agent that performs semantic understanding for the client to use. I'm going to be burning the midnight oil for the

MachineLearning -  [ [D] How are folks building conversational Retrieval Augmented Generation apps ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ftdby7/d_how_are_folks_building_conversational_retrieval/) , 2024-10-23-0912
```
I've read through various resources such as:  
- [https://vectorize.io/how-i-finally-got-agentic-rag-to-work-right/](htt
ps://vectorize.io/how-i-finally-got-agentic-rag-to-work-right/)

module_guides/deploying/chat_engines/)  
- [https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/ChatRAG-Bench](https://huggingface.co
/datasets/nvidia/ChatRAG-Bench) 

But these feel overly reductive, since they don't address complexities like:  
1) when
 to retrieve vs. just respond immediately to reduce latency  
2) rely on existing context previously retrieved in the co
nversation instead of retrieving again at the current turn  
3) partition LLM context between retrieved information and 
past conversation history.

I'm sure some teams already have good systems for this, would appreciate pointers!

MachineLearning -  [ Built a web agent which call fill Google forms based on the user details [P] ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fozud5/built_a_web_agent_which_call_fill_google_forms/) , 2024-10-23-0912
```
GitHub repo : [https://github.com/shaRk-033/web-agent](https://github.com/shaRk-033/web-agent)

Tried to solve it using 
two approaches:

# 1: Basic Scraping and Filling

This is the straightforward approach. The agent scrapes the form‚Äôs HTM
L and uses fixed XPaths to find and fill in the required fields.

* It pulls the form‚Äôs HTML, locates the fields with se
t XPaths, and inputs the answers. It‚Äôs a direct and simple method.
* If the form changes or an element isn‚Äôt where it‚Äôs 
expected, the process can fail and may need manual adjustments.

[basic approach](https://preview.redd.it/5e8g4a1k4xqd1.
png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8e984e4feaee2f0453b08c8696768c40a2a5c20)

2. Using LangChain Agents and tool call
ing

* LangChain Agent**:**¬†The agent handles everything by using the LLM‚Äôs reasoning to decide what to do next, includi
ng generating those tricky XPaths.
* Error Handling**:**¬†If something goes wrong (like an element not found), the agent 
tries again with better XPaths until it gets the job done.

[using langchain agents](https://preview.redd.it/948i88pl4xq
d1.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed1e6c19efec9f4cbbbd6ab5a22558f221cf745f)

Any recommendations to improve this w
ould be welcome. Also, if anyone has ideas on building similar web agents to automate other tasks, it would be great to 
hear them. :)
