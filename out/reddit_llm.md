```
I recently graduated with a degree in computer engineering, and I've been teaching myself full-stack development skills,
 with a focus on backend development. I find this field to be a good fit for me and I'm focusing mostly on .NET. My main
 motivation for choosing this path is the abundance of job opportunities.  
  
Apart from full-stack development, I re
ally enjoy anything AI-related. I can even say I enjoy working with AI more than building API's etc.. I have a strong fo
undation in Python and have independently studied machine learning and deep learning, completing projects such as my gra
duation thesis on medical image classification using deep learning. However, I've been hesitant to pursue a career in AI
 due to concerns about my math background and limited job opportunities in my location.  
  
Recently, my interest in 
generative AI has sparked a realization. I've delved into tools like Langchain, LlamaIndex, and LLMs, working on project
s focused on Retrieval Augmented Generation.  I also tinkered with Stable Diffusion and GANs in general previously. What
 happened is that I realized that working with generative AI is something I really enjoy and something that gives me muc
h more excitement and creative fulfillment than full-stack development.  This is where the uncertainty I'm currently fac
ing originates from.  
  
I want to be able to work with generative AI but not just be a 'prompt engineer'. I want to 
be able to understand what's going on behind the scenes and for that, I recognize the need to enhance my skills in machi
ne learning, NLP, and related areas. What I don't want is completely going down the path of data science. I want to work
 with generative AI, not just as a 'prompt engineer,' but as an AI engineer with a focus on generative AI solutions. I a
im to understand the intricacies behind the scenes and supervise the creation of 'AI-infused' software solutions from an
 architectural standpoint in the future. The problem with that is that my preparation has been geared towards full-stack
 web development, and I'm unsure if I can secure a job in AI at this point.  
  
I see four potential paths for myself
:  
  
1-) Fully commit to the full-stack development path and treat AI as a separate hobby.  
2-) Pursue full-stack 
development while building AI projects and spending an important piece of my free time preparing for a potential career 
shift.  
3-) Take the risk and actively search for a job in AI.  
4-) Somehow combine full-stack development and AI.  

  
Option 4 aligns with my ideal scenario, but I don't know how realistic it is. I don't even know how I'd label mysel
f. I feel lost and would appreciate any suggestions.  
  
Note: I am currently unemployed, focusing on enhancing my po
rtfolio for potential full-stack positions.

all -  [ LLM for RAG - embedding and chat not compatible? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/18yq1y6/llm_for_rag_embedding_and_chat_not_compatible/) , 2024-01-05-0910
```
Ok so I'm in early stages of developing a RAG system for communication (emails mostly), and so far, the plan is as follo
ws: use langchain to load email files and get metadata, use mistral:instruct on ollama to embed content, save all emails
 as chunks in elasticsearch database along with metadata, use langchain with mistral:instruct on ollama to query the ela
sticsearch db. The goal is to be able to ask questions like 'in the period April 4th 2018 until May 6th of 2018, has an 
employee from company A expressed any concerns about breaching copyright laws to an employee at company B?'. That's why 
we're using the elasticsearch db, so we can keep metadata like time and company in separate fields and avoid model hallu
cinations related to date and company affiliation. I've now come to understand that using mistral is not a good idea for
 embedding, and that I should use an encoder (Bert) or encoder-decoder (t5) model to do so. This would also help with sp
eed (I might have 2.5M emails to work with, and everything should preferably be embedded within only a day or two). My p
roblem is now though, that if I use a model that's good for embedding, then that model won't be as good for general lang
uage understanding and conversation, which I want. The whole point of doing a RAG system is to be able to chat with the 
database and ask questions, and to my understanding, Bert for instance would not be fit for that task. T5 might, but I'm
 not sure about that either, and it sure wouldn't be as good as mistral, for instance. So what to do? If I embed using B
ert, then I can't chat with my db, but if I use mistral to embed then I'm abusing the model, it'll take forever, and it'
ll create suboptimal embeddings (correct?). If it's in any way relevant, I can say that my data is mostly in Danish, but
 I have considered using machine translation to English as part of my preprocessing. I'm also not sure that that is a go
od idea, however. Thanks a lot in advance :)

```
I want an LLM like GPT to be the brain of my automated workflow. I would define an SOP (standard operating procedure) fo
r how to handle a transaction from start to finish. The transaction will be added to a Postgres DB and trigger an event 
via Amazon SNS, at which point id like my LangChain app to start processing the transaction (which has a JSON structure)
. There will be points in the processing of this transaction where API requests will need to be made based on certain co
nditions in the data. Ill need a way to store the current state of the transaction to know what should happen next (or p
ossibly have the transaction in the db be the source of truth). There will be a step where ill need to send reminder ema
ils to users once a day until they complete an action. 

Can LangChain handle most of the thinking in my automated workf
low? Eg “based on the current state of the transaction you should probably do X next.”

Any tutorials or reading you cou
ld recommend would be helpful. Thanks!

Hi everyone!

I'm developing a chatbot capable of track the entire history with a user.

I'm currently using Goliath 120
B, with Redis and langchain to return inside the prompt the latest 30 messages with the format USER: ASSISTANT:. 

Obvio
usly, after 30 messages it completely forgets what the user said before, do you use any alternative to this that can kee
ps track of the entire history? 

I read about **ConversationSummaryBufferMemory and ConversationSummaryMemory,** what d
o you thin about them? Are they a valida alternative?

Otherwise let me know if you have something else in mind!

Thank

Hi all

I am using an agent executor and agents and chains and tools to query a SQL database. 

The whole chatbot works 
fine, but I just have a question about the output I get.

https://imgur.com/a/1ET05Cq

What is the difference between th
e 'Observation' and the 'Answer'?

For my tool I have return_direct=True.

Secondly, I am trying to stream the output of
 my LLM. I am using a custom callback handler to do that, and I can stream the intermediate SQL query and everything, bu
t not the 'Answer', or the 'Observation'. How do I do that?

Finally, the LLM is the outputting the 'Answer:' text, but 
when I have a check within the custom callback handler to check for 'Answer:', it does not raise the flag as I intend it
 to.

Am I approaching this the wrong way?

However, I am required to migrate the vector database over to Azure CosmosDB (vCore). Following the documenta
tions, I have created a function that converts my text document into embeddings, and writes them to CosmosDB.

    def C
osmosEmbedder():
       loader = TextLoader('./data/file.txt')
       data = loader.load()
    
    
       # Document S
plitting
       text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size = 500, chunk_overlap = 0)
       all_splits = 
text_splitter.split_documents(data)
    
    
       CONNECTION_STRING = os.getenv('MONGO_URI')
       NAMESPACE = 'test
db.testcollection'
       DB_NAME, COLLECTION_NAME = NAMESPACE.split('.')
    
    
       client: MongoClient = MongoCl
ient(CONNECTION_STRING)
       collection = client[DB_NAME][COLLECTION_NAME]
    
    
       vectorstore = AzureCosmosD
BVectorSearch(collection, OpenAIEmbeddings())
    
    
       vectorstore.add_documents(all_splits)

And using a simila
r function, I am able to verify that the embeddings do exist within CosmosDB. Now here is where the documentation gets u
nclear to me. The documentation proceeds to use similarity search as a working example. But my goal is to use the Cosmos
DB as a vectorstore for `RetrievalQA` instead. 

Does anyone have any idea on how to implement this? For reference, the 
documentation I was referring to can be found [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/azure_c
osmos_db).

Greatly appreciate any inputs on the situation.

all -  [ Where to host RAG app? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/18xe8di/where_to_host_rag_app/) , 2024-01-05-0910
```
 

I'm working on a student project that involves a FastAPI backend serving a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) appli
cation, which interfaces with a frontend already hosted on Netlify. The app leverages the LLaMA index, and I recently ma
de some enhancements following the 'small to big retrieval' strategies outlined [here](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/sta
ble/optimizing/advanced_retrieval/advanced_retrieval.html).

While these improvements have significantly boosted the app
's performance, they've also led to a new challenge: my current hosting solution on a Digital Ocean droplet isn't cuttin
g it anymore, as I'm consistently running into out-of-memory issues.

I'm now in the market for a hosting platform that 
can comfortably handle the heavier memory requirements of my updated backend. Key requirements include:

* Robust enough
 to support a memory-intensive FastAPI app.
* HTTPS support for security.
* Preferably developer-friendly and cost-effec
tive, considering it's for a student project.

Does anyone have recommendations for hosting providers or services that c
an meet these needs? Or, if you've worked on similar projects, I'd love to hear how you tackled the hosting challenges. 
Any insights, tips, or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you all in advance!

```
Hello people,

We've been at it for a long time and still are not understanding how to get a correct output from any mod
el. So what we're having problems understanding is how langchain expects the prompt template to be formated. THe thought
 flow. We are trying different Thought, Action, Action Input and Observation, Final Answer, etc.. methods and none seem 
to work with tools and regular conversations (and a mix of these).

What we really need is a manual to read that talks a
bout how these keywords are supposed to be used. For example, which ones are important for the agent and which for the l
lm.

We've tried so many templates. Some stop responding at the Observation point, some include the whole thought proces
s in the response, some don't work at all. We are god at reading and understanding. We just need an official source to r
ead from. If there is none, can someone help us here ?

Here is an example of our prompt template right now, but stalls 
:

<s> Today is {date}. Your name is Betty. You work for Shopping321 in Spain. Your duties involve helping our customer 
named {name} manage his online purchases.

TOOLS:

\----

&#x200B;

You have access to the following tools:

&#x200B;

(
LIST OF TOOLS I DELETED FOR PRIVACY, but they are working)

&#x200B;

THOUGHT PROCESS:

\----

&#x200B;

Start your thou
ght process using the following format:

&#x200B;

Thought: What´s the nature of the request? Does it involve using a sp
ecific tool?

Process: Understand the user's request and determine if you need to use a tool or various tools.

Temporar
y Observation: Initial thoughts on how to proceed.

&#x200B;

If you need to use a tool, use the following thought proce
ss:

&#x200B;

Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes.

Action: \[Action to take, choose from tool list\] like this examp
le: 'InvoiceSearch'

Action Input: the input for the action and {request\_id}

Observation: the result of the action.

.
.. (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat only N times)

&#x200B;

If you do not need to use a tool, u
se the following thought process:

&#x200B;

Thought: How can I respond with my own knowledge without using a tool?

Pro
cess: Handle the request using natural conversation, applying the abstraction

Temporary Observation: Observations about
 the handling process

&#x200B;

CONCLUSIONS:

\----

Before giving the final response, gather all of your thoughts and 
observations made with and without tool usage. Order the thoughts aligned with the user's requests. Then prepare to give
 a final response following this thought process:

&#x200B;

Thought: Does the response fullfil the user's request based
 on all of the observations gathered thus far?

Process: Make final adjustments in order to fullfil user's requests. Use
 more tools if necessary.

&#x200B;

Betty: Deliver the comprehensive final response.

&#x200B;

Begin!

Clearly, the LLM is understanding the ask correctly as it maps e.g. 'Toronto' to city. However, the aut

Hi, I am a 23yo female SDE. My qualifications, Bachelors in CSE graduated in 2022. 
In 2021 joined a decent company as a
n intern in AI/ML department. In the name of AI we were made to annotate data but because we had a few data scientists i
n the team and I thought we would get to learn from them in the future I continued there. Also there were not many compa
nies for AIML roles during our placement drive and I didn’t care to look out for internships off campus ( big mistake ig
), I was quite laid back because of covid. 

So after my internship I got PPO and stayed in the company, worked on Named
 Entity Recognition, fixing bugs of existing product, making APIs, document parsing, using OpenAI API in our existing pr
oduct, Langchain, prompt writing. 

But I feel like my tech stack sucks, feel kya that is true. Most profiles for Python
 related roles require AWS, Azure, Frontend and what not. I have no experience in this plus I don’t like backend develop
ement. So I thought of learning new skills and finding new roles. 

*dramatic music*
Thanks to OpenAi our company decide
d to dissolve AIML team in October23, all the senior roles were sacked and juniors (like me) were moved to other teams. 
My current team works with Django, and I am supposed to do core backend dev work now,I’m struggling for life fr. 

And t
here’s more, so the annual review got messed up by my current manager because she didn’t get my previous manager’s  inpu
t and gave me an extremely bad review which has made me feel worthless and depressed because all the work I had done til
l October was not considered. I had led a project that was internally used by many other teams of our company and it was
 praised a lot. 

So now I’m anxious and depressed, working for a company that I hate, with an awful team manager who di
dn’t even provide KTs. I’m looking for new roles but the market sucks. I want to get into business analytics, I have som
e experience with data science during college but I have zero business knowledge. Thinking of doing MBA in Business Anal
ytics from a private university in Punjab (under 10 lakh fee). But yaar yeh top b schools vagerah na jaane ka fomo hogya
 toh? 
Bhai, zindagi jhand hogayi soch soch ke, ho kuch nahi raha merese.

Also I don’t want to spend 20-30 lakh on mba,
 I think it’s not worth it, especially in my case. Loan kaun lega yaar and I don’t want to add financial burden on my fa
mily. Also waiting another year to prepare for CAT, appear for it, results, interviews. And I don’t think I can sustain 
my current job for long with how I’ve been feeling, I have no motivation and all I do is overthink and get anxious.

    Human: What is my name?

    Human: What is my name?
  
  AI: I do not have access to your personal information, so I cannot answer that question.

Hi all, I’m new to the technology and I’m looking to build a LLm api. Would like to seek advice to improve on the respo
nse speed. 

Problem statement:

I am working to build a chat feature for a manufacturing repair line to guide workers o
n how to fix various issue. The product changes hourly and so does the solution to fix it. The boss is very good coming 
out with solution but is way too busy to explain or teach his 38 repair man. His goal is to create a ML chat bot to do t
he reply where he will update the database with all sort of solution and when his repair man query the chat bot to searc
h for the best answer. He knows he will need the ML chat bot because:

1. Everyone ask a question differently. 
2. He ca
n add more solutions and does not need to repeat himself.

The chat bot must achieve a few critical requirement from my 
crazy boss. 

1. Each response must be below 1 sec. (Includes multiple prompt)
2. No simulating of a quick reply. He wan
ts the entire sentences to be out under 1sec. 
3.Must have a database query where he can upload a list of his solution. 

4. Must have memory but does not need to saved to a database
5. Answers should be short and easy. 
6. Don’t ask him to 
just let his employee search the database. He wants to move forward in the llm space. Not backwards. 
7. On-premise or o
n cloud doesn’t matter. (Prototype first before and funds)

The solution is usually short.
 
Example, “use a size 8 wenc
h with a bottom power up approach. Control the strength applied”

However the below 1 sec requirement is just crazy! Her
e is my build:

Langchain interface (quantization)
Llama-2-7b-chat-hf
Bitsnbytes: 4bit, nf4, double quant, torch.bfloat1
6

FAISS for memory caching
Sentence-transformers/all-mpney-base-v2
Langchain.memory conversationBufferMemory

vector da
tabase for storage of solution
Langchain vector store qdrant

Running on 3080 gpu

Prompt template.  


Total response t
ime taken per query: 1min

Can anyone provide any better solution to improve the speed?
I’m thinking of using vllm inste
ad to improve on the response speed. But I don’t think I can achieve 1sec. 

 Please help before I get fired.

Hello,

I'm working on a code generation system for my personal usage. I've had some success with a RAG system using lan

uld be to finetune the model on my own code base.

I've seen several tutorials with axolotl on a text-to-SQL generation 
dataset, or on some prompt answering dataset, but I haven't seen anything like finetuning the model on multiple user-own
ed repos.

This surprises as I would have thought this was the next logical step to improve accuracy. Am I mistaken ? Is
 the knowledge added by finetuning already present in the context ? Is the performance gain not worth the hassle ?

Did 
somebody already tried this and has some feedback ?

From a corpus of text, how can you detect emerging topics and their evolution through time?

Introducing Temporal Augmen
ted Retrieval (TAR). (built in the context of buildspace n&w s4)

TAR is an open-source advanced RAG approach that aims 
to factor in the dynamic and temporal aspects of textual data when performing retrieval.

It allows us to understand the
 evolution of discussed topics over time.

The idea behind this project is to open the debate regarding the current limi
tations of RAG methods

This first approach has been built without using RAG frameworks (like Jerry Liu’s langchain) and
 focuses on financial tweets

MachineLearning -  [ [R][P] Autogen + Langchain Tools + Local LLM doesn't work. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/18tex1j/rp_autogen_langchain_tools_local_llm_doesnt_work/) , 2024-01-05-0910
```
Hey folks, 

So I'm playing around with the agent framework Autogen and I'm trying to create agents by providing it cust
om tools to use. These custom tools are defined in the langchain framework. Furthermore, I am using open source LLM mode
ls like Mistral, LLAMA, Mixtral etc.

In my experience, I have been unable to get the Autogen+LocalLLM framework to iden
tify the right tools to use given the prompt. However it does a fantastic job with the GPT model. 

Please note that my 
goal is for the agent to mandatorily use the tools provided and not come up with its own code. And the agent should figu
re out the right tool to use. 

I have been very explicit with my prompting, despite which I am unable to get this to wo
rk.

Any thoughts and suggestions? Please let me know ! Please share your experiences as well. Cheers !

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Seeking Advice for Building a School Handbook Chatbot Using OpenAI and Vector Databases ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/18rndcp/p_seeking_advice_for_building_a_school_handbook/) , 2024-01-05-0910
```
Hello everyone,

I'm embarking on a project to create a chatbot for my school's handbook, aiming to make it a resource f
or students to easily access information. As someone relatively new to AI, I'm seeking guidance on implementing this.

M
y current plan is to use OpenAI as the primary language learning model, focusing on affordability. I am considering inte
grating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and LangChain for enhanced functionality. However, I'm quite perplexed abou
t choosing an appropriate vector database, as many options appear costly. The goal is to keep this system live and acces
sible for student usage without breaking the bank.

I'm also looking into open-source embedding models to pair with the 
vector database. Pinecone has caught my attention, but its pricing seems steep for our budget.

Does anyone have recomme
ndations or tips on affordable yet effective tools and strategies for this project? Any insights on vector databases sui
table for educational use, or ways to optimize cost without compromising quality, would be greatly appreciated.

Thank y
ou in advance for your help!

(I typed out my problem and had gpt4 fix up the format and wording dont bash me)

MachineLearning -  [ [P] flex-prompt: a flexible prompt rendering engine that ensures you'll never exceed your LLM's cont ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/18d581q/p_flexprompt_a_flexible_prompt_rendering_engine/) , 2024-01-05-0910
```
When working with LLMs, I frequently experience *token agony*.

[Error: This model's maximum context length is 4097 but 
you are trying to push in all of War and Peace, you imbecile](https://preview.redd.it/nldj0qva4s4c1.png?width=1348&forma

Perhaps you've experienced it too! The issue is particularl
y pronounced with retrieval augmented pipelines, since you have potentially quite a large set of documents which you cou
ld perhaps include in the prompt if only you knew how big it could be.

I got tired of hacking around this headache, so 
I wrote `flex-prompt` to address it. I wish I didn't have to. Perhaps someone can point me to a better solution! But I c
ouldn't find one, so alas, here it is.

`flex-prompt` provides a basic layout and component model to help you describe h
ow you want the pieces of your prompt to grow and shrink and a token-aware renderer which renders your prompt to fit you
r model's window.

[Github](https://github.com/queerviolet/flex-prompt), [Intro to flex prompt colab](https://colab.rese
arch.google.com/github/queerviolet/flex-prompt/blob/main/doc/intro_to_flex_prompt.ipynb)

# Quick examples

You can just
 `render(Flex(...))`, and flex prompt will fit the prompt into the context window, and tell you how many tokens are left
 over for the response:

    from flex_prompt import render, Flex, Expect
    rendered = render(
        Flex([
        
  'Given the text, answer the question.',
          '--Text--',
          WAR_AND_PEACE,
          '--End Text--',
     
     'Question: What's the title of this text?',
          'Answer:', Expect()
        ], join='\n'),
        model='tex
t-davinci-002')
    
    # rendered.output is the string to send to the model
    # rendered.max_response_tokens is how 
many tokens you can
    #   request in response without exceeding the model's context window
    print(rendered.output, 
rendered.max_response_tokens)

More typically, you'll want to define a prompt which takes parameters. To do this, you ca
n create a class (probably a dataclass) which derives `Flexed`:

    from flex_prompt import Flexed, Expect
    from dat
aclasses import dataclass
    
    @dataclass
    class Ask(Flexed):
      text: str
      question: str
      answer: s
tr | Expect = Expect()
      instruct: str = 'Given a text, answer the question.'
    
      flex_join = '\n' # yielded 
items will be joined by newlines
      def content(self, _ctx):
        if self.instruct:
          yield 'Given the tex
t, answer the question.'
          yield ''
        yield '-- Begin Text --'
        # note: we're using `Flex` here jus
t to attach a flex_weight
        # to the text, telling the renderer we'd like more space for the
        # text than a
nything else.
        yield Flex([self.text], flex_weight=2)
        yield '-- End Text --'
        yield 'Question: ', 
self.question
        yield 'Answer: ', self.answer

The renderer works much as you might expect. You can \`yield\` anyt
hing which you can pass to the top-level render function, including other components, creating a whole tree.

Note that 
the component above can be used to render both the actual prompt and examples. Examples simply have an `answer`. This is
 useful for experimenting with different ways of structuring a prompt while ensuring that all the examples we present to
 the LLM are in the same format.

# LangChain and Haystack Integrations

Flex prompt doesn't really care how you execute
 your prompt. For convenience, `render(model=)` does accept both LangChain and Haystack models:

    ask_tolstoy = Ask(t
ext=WAR_AND_PEACE, question='Who wrote this?')
    
    # Using LangChain
    from langchain.llms import OpenAI
    lc_l
lm = OpenAI()
    rendering = render(ask_tolstoy, model=lc_llm)
    print(lc_llm(rendering.output, max_tokens=rendering.
max_response_tokens))
    
    
    # Using Haystack
    from haystack.nodes import PromptModel
    
    hs_llm = Prompt
Model(model_name_or_path='text-davinci-002', api_key=os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'])
    rendering = render(ask_tolstoy, m
odel=hs_llm)
    print(hs_llm.invoke(rendering.output, max_tokens=rendering.max_response_tokens))
    

# Is it worth it
?

As models grow larger and larger context windows, I've asked myself whether this is worth it. Won't context sizes eve
ntually big enough to put in everything we might want without worry?

One response: 'everything I might want' is a very,
 very big set, plausibly bigger than any window size we're going to see soon.

Another: being able to do this kind of to
ken accounting is useful even if we don't completely fill context windows. For example, we might be able to augment our 
prompt with examples, documents, and tips. How much space should we allocate to each? The answer might well be model-dep
endent. How do we figure it out?

Flex prompt's output, a `Rendering` object, actually holds the entire component tree. 
You can look through the object to see how many tokens were allocated to each child. This is currently very manual, but 
it does provide the bedrock infrastructure to e.g. run tests to discover the optimal balance of augmented data for a giv
en prompt and model.

Additionally, the right admixture (and for that matter, the right *phrasing*) may well be model-de
pendent. Flex prompt currently provides only very limited model-specific rendering (you can look at [`ctx.target`](https
://ctx.target), but it doesn't tell you much), but there's no reason that can't be significantly improved. At the extrem
e limit is prompt *erasure*, where we fine-tune a model to require no or minimal instructions/examples for a given set o
f prompts. Flex prompt can enable transitions like this with no changes to the pipelines themselves: you'd still use the
 same prompt components, they'd just render differently if the target is a fine-tuned model vs. a generic one.

# Status
 & Future Work

Flex prompt is very much in early development. I would love to hear if and how people find it useful, an
d would love input and contributions!

Some things I'd like to tackle in the future:

* **Rendering message lists.** Fle
x prompt currently only renders strings, though it's set up to be able to render any type of output. Message histories b
asically grow without bound, so supporting this seems like a no-brainer.
* **Pagination**. If your rendering overflows (
as above, where we're trying to stuff *the entirety of war and peace* into a prompt), flex prompt will clip the offendin
g pieces to fit. But there's currently no way to get 'the next page'. But the `Rendering` actually retains enough inform
ation to do this! It would be great to be able to call `render(...).pages()` to get the sequence of prompts as we 'scrol
l' whatever has overflowed. This is medium-hanging fruit—a little tricky because we do have to descend the tree of rende
rings to find the exact one(s) which overflowed and then update only those.
* **Token accounting.** As mentioned above, 
you can currently grovel around in `Rendering` and look at the pieces of the prompt. This would be more useful if it wer
e a little easier, e.g. if you could use `rendering[Examples]` to find all the parts rendered by the `Examples` componen
t, or `rendering['advice']` to find all the parts which are tagged (somehow) as 'advice'. The use case here is prompt op
timization: discovering the optimal number or percentage of tokens to allot to each thing we might want to drop into the
 prompt.
* **More integrations.** Currently, flex prompt only supports OpenAI models. You can register your own target f
inders, but it would be great to have more support out of the box. This is mostly a matter of digging around and finding
 the tokenizers and window sizes for common models, and then writing the appropriate target finders. Contributions very 
welcome!
* **Model tuning.** As mentioned above, the rendering context could provide a mechanism for fetching model-spec
ific parameters. The basic idea is that `ctx[param]` will evaluate `param` against the context, and then we can define s
ome parameter types which load their model-specific values from *gestures vaguely* somewhere.
