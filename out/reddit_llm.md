Hello!

I was looking for a tool to use ChatGPT from the terminal (which is where I spend most of my computer time). Mos
t of the stuff I found seems a bit overengineered, so I decided to build my own :)  


It took me just a couple of hours
, and despite being only 60 lines of code, it does all I need:

&#x200B;

* interact with ChatGPT with a chat-like exper
ience
* remember conversations using memory
* store conversations locally
* load and continue conversations
* set the te
mperature of the model
* limit the memory depth to save tokens and contain costs

Here is the code: [https://github.com/

Any constructive feedback is very welc
ome, and feel free to fork and extend for your use case :)

Hi all,

&#x200B;

 **Is it just me or is Langchain too complicated to work with?** 

I'm not exactly riding on the LLM 
wave but I'm trying to learn langchain to build LLM applications. My company wants to know how to use GenAI and LLMs in 
their use cases.

Langchain has been a big pain in my butt so far. With its confusing documentation and countless nested
 imports, I'm not sure if this is the best framework to experiment with LLM applications. I find the abstractions very h
ard to understand, as compared to say, scikit-learn.

Measure theory is more manageable than langchain, IMO. Am I too st
upid to understand langchain or is it really one big complicated mess? If there are better alternatives, please suggest 
them in the comments.

Hey everyone ,

excuse me if I sound like a noob in these topics . but recently I discovered the world of huggingface an
d local LLMs . I work at a company that provides software services to a lot of clients , and one of our products is supp
osed to be a chatbot that aids the customers by guiding them or answering any question about that client . in addition t
o that , each customer has some personal data in the client's database , let's say stuff like name , date joined , activ
ity .. and other analytics regarding his membership with that specific client . which all of them can be easily retrieve
d by using our companies API requests that returns user info in a json format .

I came across this post [https://www.re
ddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/14vnfh2/my\_experience\_on\_starting\_with\_fine\_tuning\_llms/](https://www.reddit.com/r
/LocalLLaMA/comments/14vnfh2/my_experience_on_starting_with_fine_tuning_llms/)that further made me realize that fine-tun
ing a model on that client's specific data might be a good idea .

collect data , structure it like (preferably in  #ins
truction,#input,#output format as I saw this is good format based on alpaca-cleaned data-set) , and fine-tune one of the
 hugging face models on it . that way , any question about that client , the model would be able to answer it in a speci
fic way rather than a generic way like a generic LLM would do .

ok great , let's say we fine-tuned the model on that cl
ient's data , and now it can answer any question about that client for the user like any FAQ , any info about the client
 , how to register , how to cancel etc...  but it got me thinking , how would I also train the model to be able to answe
r queries where the user asks about some specific info about himself and not just some generic info question about the c
lient ? , imagine if the client is a gym , how can I train the model to be also able to answer a question similar to 'wh
en does my membership end ?' . should I provide also in the training data examples for these types of questions with som
e fake data about a fake user ? or is there no need to train the model on these types of questions and just do it using 
LangChain by specifying type of chains that get user info as input and a query from the user , while also providing some
 examples in the prompt to further help the LLM understand how the questions is supposed to be answered ?but also , how 
would I do that in Langchain for a lot of different types of queries ? should I just think of a lot of possible queries 
from that user that asks for specific user info ?

or is there a dynamic way in langchain to firstly get the query , fig
ure out what sort of info needed to answer the question , use one of our API calls to retrieve the info , and then answe
r using that Info ?

sorry if I rambled some nonsense , I would be happy for some advice from you guys

I was exploring the prompts in Langchain's agents and the calls to OpenAI's endpoints, and I found it doesn't use the ['

    New question:
    {new message}

Why is this? I can think of some advantages, such 
as:

1. Conceptually, it makes more sense as an LLM receives a string to predict a string
2. It is LLM agnostic
3. It al
lows you to have more control of what's going on
4. It makes everything more transparent

But, am I missing something?

Hey,   


At Neum AI, we have been playing around with several iterations of doing semantic text splitting using LLMs. T
oday, we released an open-source package with our latest for people to try out. At a high level, these capabilities enab
le you to provide a sample piece of text and let the tool come up with a strategy to split that text. That strategy gets
 converted to code which you can then leverage across a document set. We have found this to be especially useful when we
 have large number of documents that follow patterns / templates, as well as when we have customers give us one offs tha
t are hard to split using more traditional methods. 

The tool is by no means perfect, but at least gives a good idea of
 the right direction to take when chunking the document. You can try out the tools either on our playground or directly 
using our python module. Links to both below:

 taken in markdown. I've managed to cobble together something that generates an answer but the hit rate is spotty at bes
t. For example I can query this thing asking who the CEO of a division is (person is introduced in page 1) and it will t
ell me it doesn't know, but then I ask it what the capital expenditure was and it gives me the right answer which leaves
 me scratching my head.

Some more detail on what I did;

* I use the 13b Vicuna 1.5 loaded into Ooba and exposed throug
h the API
* Using LangChain to load the file and then embedding it using bge\_large
* Chunk size is 500 with overlap of 
100 and then store it into Chroma
* Use RetrievalQA, chaintype 'stuff', and k:5
* Use the instruct, input, response prom
pt template with context with customary don't make up answer.

Looking at the chunks retrieved it feels like its giving 
me really random chunks. I saw another person use things such as reranking which looks promising however just given how 
poorly this is performing on some very simple questions ('Who is X?') and telling me X is not mentioned in the given tex
t despite being introduced in the 1st page - I am wondering if I'm doing something wrong more fundamentally.

all -  [ Evaluating Extraction Tasks: Best Practices? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/16mm8de/evaluating_extraction_tasks_best_practices/) , 2023-09-21-0909
```
I'm developing an application utilizing langchain & llms, primarily for extracting specific structured data from vast te
xt sources. Typically, this results in 20-30 extracted points per instance.

I aim to ensure the system comprehensively 
captures the intended points. What's the best approach to evaluate its performance and fine-tune the prompts, allowing f
or efficient model comparisons?

While I've looked into application-level llm evaluation ([**source**](https://wandb.ai/
ayush-thakur/llm-eval-sweep/reports/How-to-Evaluate-Compare-and-Optimize-LLM-Systems--Vmlldzo0NzgyMTQz)), most methods a
re tailored to different use cases like Question Answering or Math problems.

Here are my initial thoughts:

* **Multipl
e Extractions**: Repeatedly run the extraction process and measure the overlap of facts.
* **Human Annotation**: Ideal b
ut time-consuming.
* **LLM Self-Evaluation**: Input the extraction's input-output to GPT4-32k for a reflection on its pe
rformance.

Before I commit considerable resources to these, are there any industry standards or overlooked methods I sh
ould be aware of?

```
Naively, I am familiar with how frameworks like Langchain lets you 'chain' together a series of steps (using both prompt
s and external APIs), s.t. an LLM can answer a question with more accuracy and timeliness.

Sample Steps:

1. Search a v
ector db with your question/embedding

2. 'Map reduce' or summarize the multiple results into concise answers

3. Respon
d with the final answer or say I dont know

Is there a more sophisticated approach to RAG? What are some other ways to a
chieve RAG outside of the Langchain approach (which is quite.. finicky at times)

nswers questions from the PDF content. It does so by:

1. Splitting the documents into chunks.
2. Creating embeddings fo
r each document.
3. Storing the documents and embeddings in a Vectorstore.

So far, the PoC seems to work and does what 
I intended it to do. Now, I need to give instructions to OpenAI to answer questions from the PDF by following a certain 
set of rules. I have added these instructions as part of the System prompt. However, the scope of my entire instruction 
set is also a full length PDF document. Is it possible to add instructions as embeddings as well?

```
 I'm currently using Langchain to split my texts into chunks, but I believe it may not always yield the most optimal vec
tors. My source material consists of lengthy articles, which often contain contextual information distributed across the
 entire article. When I break these articles into smaller chunks, I run the risk of losing important contextual informat
ion.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to enhance this process? I've been contemplating the idea of introducing a
 pre-vectorization step where I could transform all the articles into a 'question and answer' format through an OpenAI r
equest. However, I'm concerned that this approach might be costly, or perhaps there are more effective alternatives avai
lable. Any insights would be greatly appreciated.

Recently saw a tweet which got quite some traction talking about how many people haven't used sci-kit learn in months as
 data scientists.

This has been replaced with PyTorch, HuggingFace, langchain, supergradients etc.

This didn't really 
make sense to me as the tooling mentioned isn't really comparable to sci-kit learn but I'm curious and slightly worried 
I might be falling behind and not up to date with things so just asking if I'm just behind the curve or what you guys th

Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07870](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07870)

Abstract:

>Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) enable research
ers and developers to build autonomous language agents that can automatically solve various tasks and **interact with en
vironments, humans, and other agents** using natural language interfaces. **We consider language agents as a promising d
irection towards artificial general intelligence** and release Agents, an **open-source library** with the goal of openi
ng up these advances to a wider non-specialist audience. Agents is carefully engineered to support important **features 
including planning, memory,  tool usage, multi-agent communication, and fine-grained symbolic  control.** Agents is **us
er-friendly** as it **enables non-specialists** to build, customize, test, tune, and deploy state-of-the-art **autonomou
s language agents without much coding**. The **library** is also **research-friendly as its modularized design** makes i
t **easily extensible for researchers.**

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Ways to speed up llama-2 summarization on sagemaker? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/16iutyp/p_ways_to_speed_up_llama2_summarization_on/) , 2023-09-21-0909
```
I'm currently working on a project to give a quick summary of long articles/conversations.

I'm running llama-2-7b-chat-
hf with 4bit quantization on a g5.2xlarge instance on sagemaker.

The method I'm using is map\_reduce (option 2)from thi
s webpage [https://python.langchain.com/docs/use\_cases/summarization](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/summa
rization))

Of everything I've tried this is the only one that's been able to do decent summaries in a reasonable amount
 of time. However with really long articles (10,000+ words) it takes \~6 minutes before giving an output.

I tried runni
ng this same thing on a g5.12xlarge instance which has 4 A10G gpus but it hasn't reduced the time by any noticeable amou
nt.

Is there anything else I could be doing to speed this up?

&#x200B;

For reference here is the code I'm running in 
Sagemaker notebook

```
Hey all, we just released our new project/paper and we thought you all might find it useful!

Our project (Kani) is a su
per lightweight and hackable alternative to frameworks like LangChain or simpleAIchat meant to help developers hook in c
allable functions or tools to chat models easily. With Kani, devs can write functions in pure python and just add one li
ne (the `@ai_function()` decorator) to turn any function into an AI-callable function!

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Data Extraction using fine-tuned LLM? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/16fenlb/d_data_extraction_using_finetuned_llm/) , 2023-09-21-0909
```
Hey Reddit,

I'm working on a tool to pull data from highly irregular Excel files. I've gotten reasonable results which 
is extremely fast with standard Python coding, but it's far from perfect due to the lack of standardized templates. 

In
terestingly, when I tested ChatGPT-4 on a sample table, it did a decent job at data extraction. However, relying solely 
on GPT-4 has its downsides like token limits and slow processing speed (and data privacy issues). Plus, splitting the Ex
cel sheet to fit within these limits results in loss of context and data.

I'm considering fine-tuning a language model 
to post-process data that was in a Pandas DataFrame (perhaps converted to JSON). Has anyone had success with this approa
ch or have alternative recommendations? I've tried Langchain, but it wasn't helpful.

I have figured out to extract the 
relevant columns, but the post-processing part is where I am considering using an LLM which understands the domain and w
hat needs to be extracted based on the examples I feed it.

Looking forward to your thoughts! And would be happy to answ
er any additional questions.

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Chains and Agents ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/16d7ee6/d_chains_and_agents/) , 2023-09-21-0909
```
I think there's a lot of confusion around AI agents today and it's mainly because of lack of definition and using the wr
ong terminology.

We've been talking to many companies who are claiming they're working on agents but when you look unde
r the hood, they are really just chains.

I just listened to the Latent Space pod with¬†Harrison Chase (Founder of Langch
ain) and I really liked how he thinks about chains vs agents.

Chains: sequence of tasks in a more rigid order, where yo
u have more control, more predictability.  
Agents: handling the edge-cases, the long-tail of things that can happen.

A
nd the most important thing is that it's not an OR question but an AND one: you can use them in the same application by 
starting with chains -> figuring our the edge-cases -> using agents to deal with them.

We're building a fast low latency Graph Database called FalkorDB that will also support Vector search.  
It's based on R
edis and can be used both as a stand alone database or a module for existing Redis.  
It feels like that is going to be 
the most optimized way to serve Knowledge as RAG, would love to get your feedback.

It already supports LlamIndex and Langchain:

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Is there anything LangChain can do better than using LLMs directly (either through a website or  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/165airj/d_is_there_anything_langchain_can_do_better_than/) , 2023-09-21-0909
```
I haven't used ChatGPT a lot or any other LLMs, I've been reading about  Langchain and its use cases, and I'm having tro
uble wrapping my head  around exactly what it does. From what I understand, its an alternative  interface for LLMs, allo
wing for easy switching between them, and makes  some work for specific use cases easier. If I wanted to write an app or
  script to interact with LLMs and do other tasks, how would LangChain be  better than just making API call(s) to an LLM
, getting back the result  as a string, and doing whatever with it?

```
My colleague just wrote up an article on [LLM-based apps and how to use data engineering tools to help build them faster
](https://meltano.com/blog/llm-apps-are-mostly-data-pipelines/) that I found really insightful.

It contains a complete 
implementation

* with scraping context data from a docs website
* chunking it, getting embeddings via the openAI API
* 
loading it into pinecone
* and finally a simple Q&A interface with streamlit on top of it

**Here's a quick summary:**


* LangChain and LlamaIndex are great tools for quick exploration
* But aren't perfect for production-grade use
* I think
 we all know the 'LangChain is pointless' debate, but there's a lot of real meat to it, and Pat describes a few of them 
(a lot of LangChains extractors are super basic, 2-3 liners without retries etc.)
* LLM applications are all about movin
g data, extracting and enriching data (creating embeddings!) are the most expensive ones of those steps
* A bunch of dat
a engineering tools are out there that make these two steps much easier, versionable, robust, and reproducible.
* Meltan
o is one such tool and Pat implemented the above described pipeline with it

**FWIW**: The GitHub project that comes wit
h the post is super easy to run and super modular. I just tested it and was able to modify everything for my own applica
tion within 30 mins.

Hey everyone!

As you can guess from the title, this is the error I get. I only changed the model in AutoModelForCausalL
M, Older version was 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

`'''`

`model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-c
hat-hf',`

`device_map ='auto',`

`torch_dtype = torch.float16,`

`use_auth_token = True)`

`'''`

&#x200B;

However, si
nce my GPU is NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 TI, it answers a simple question in 20 mins. Then I changed it to: 

`model = Auto
ModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GGUF',`

`model_file = 'llama-2-7b-chat.q4_K_M.gguf',`

`use_auth_token = True)`

Hey folks,

I've been digging everywhere, including here, for LLMs and custom applications. So, I read many things, lear
ned from ppl here. Its time to try something. I will try implement Llama v2 - Langchain - Chroma combination. But also I
 want to upload a dataset so that I can try my model on that. 

I find some datasets big enough (for now, 2-5 gb is ok) 
however they are table-style. I want something more texty, I mean I could use 'American Stories' or 'Arxiv' however I be
lieve that they are already used by Llama to train. 

&#x200B;

Is there any suggestions or sources that you can provide
 ? Thanks!
