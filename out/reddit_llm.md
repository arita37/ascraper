**
Background:**

I'm applying to AI Engineer and Data Scientist jobs, I want to work with LLMs and cutting-edge AI.

I did
 had interviews (using my old CV), but I think he reflected ML more then LLMs which is my real speciallity. So I got man
y denials from relevant jobs and decided to edit it. (It made by resume writer who did terrible job IMO)

I created new 
CV yesterday and decided to post it in reddit (not in this 'r/') ppl said it have too much information and refered me he
re where I found the wiki and more useful material.

Just done making my new CV.

**About skill section:**

* Programmin
g Languages:
   * I'm familiar but no work exp with Java and JavaScript (and I see it in many jobs) should it get in the
re?
* Deep learning:
   * Should I say Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning or PEFT, or Low-Rank Adaptation or LoRA most Job 
descriptions request PEFT or LoRA?
   * should I include supervised fine-tuning?
   * Should I include Hugging face? (Tr
anspormers library) same with openai vs OpenAI API
* Machine learning:
   * should I include OpenCV? (lower efficiency b
ut familiar with)
   * Also XGBoost, familiar with it but see it in a lot of jobs
* Artificial intellegence:
   * should
 I include key NLP libraries like spaCy, NLTK, and Stanza (or StanfordNLP)?
   * I did Include prompt Engineering, LangC
hain but should I also Include LangSmith? (high demmand, maybe even CoT?)
   * Also removed some important key concepts 
like Word Embeddings ,Text Embeddings, Text Cleaning, Tokenizers, Text Similarity, Text Generation, Text Classification,
 etc.

**About Experiance:**

* AI Engineer:
   * I feel like it still might be too long sentences, should I break somet
hing into 2 sentences?
* The Other 2 Jobs:
   * TBH I didnt really knew what to type in result since I left the research
 when I found a job.

**About Projects:**

* Its actually projects that I've done in my last year in the degree but some
 hiring managers, especially from Cyber security was interested in my Ransomware.

**About Education:**

* The way I wro
te my GPA is ok? (I will change to 3.8 if I apply US)

all -  [ GenAi Analytics Agent ](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1eeifu5/genai_analytics_agent/) , 2024-07-29-0911
```
I'm in the process of building an Ai Analytics agent using OpenAI, Langchain and Streamlit. I could use some feedback on
 my current set up and was hoping some of you might be able to give me some tips.

The Goal:
So the goal is to provide t
he use with charts and graphs of data that is stored in our semantic layer on Snowflake. 

The Data:
We are fortunate en
ough to have descriptions for every column and naming conventions for columns used in joins. I have created embeddings f
or all the table names and column descriptions and have put these behind an API that can use a semantic similarity searc
h.

The Agent:
I built some functions that can call the API endpoints to get either relevant table names or column names
. I then added a function that can fetch a table schema, one that can fetch the data from specified columns from snowfla
ke and one more that can filter the data using pandas. I have provided all these functions as tools to a Langchain agent
 with a manually written prompt with some guidelines on how to use the tools.

This set up has given mixed results. When
 it gets the right table name it can work like a charm, but it still struggles sometimes. For instance when a user is lo
oking for revenue per week it puts daily sales into the search query, or it searches on the article level instead of per
 store. Sometimes it also looks up the schema of every table to find the right one, using up a lot of tokens.

I feel li
ke I'm moving in the right direction, but I wonder if there are maybe best practices I'm missing, causing me to use to m
any tokens. Furthermore I hear a lot about people using techniques like DSPy, Knowledge Graph and fine tuning, but I'm n
ot sure whether these would offer (significant) benefits in my case.

Any help/feedback on my approach would be much app
reciated!

```
Hey folks,

I’ve been looking into GPT4o tool calling feature for my project and came to conclusion that its architectur
e can be quite inefficient in costs (not very surprising). 

Every time I want to use a tool, I have to re-send the enti
re chat history—system prompts, user messages, tool calls, and pratically everything. This means I’m paying for those ex
tra tokens all over again, which can add up quickly if my prompt is 4000 tokens long.

I get that this is for privacy re
asons, but it’s definitely not the most cost-friendly. Has anyone else dealt with this? How are you handling it? Any tip
s to make this less of a hassle or to keep the costs down?

I need it just for 'calculator tool' that will enable GPT4o 
to make adjustments to various numeric data in a determinstic way..

Would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions!


Thanks!

```
https://preview.redd.it/8ifdm442v7fd1.png?width=1492&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2b7c1b3391d17d940dc36705f2a9407c822df73

Th
ere are two primary approaches to getting started with Agentic workflows: **workflow automation** for domain experts and
 **autonomous agents** for resource-constrained projects. By observing how agents perform tasks successfully, you can ma
p out and optimize workflow steps, reducing hallucinations, costs, and improving performance.

Let's explore how to auto
mate the “Dependencies Upgrade” for your product team using CrewAI then Langgraph. Typically, a software engineer would 
handle this task by visiting changelog webpages, reviewing changes, and coordinating with the product manager to create 
backlog stories. With agentic workflow, we can streamline and automate these processes, saving time and effort while all
owing engineers to focus on more engaging work.

  
For demonstration, [source-code is available on Github](https://gith
ub.com/AgiFlow/repo-upgrade).

For detailed explanation, please see below videos:

[Part 1: Get started with Autonomous 
Agents using CrewAI](https://youtu.be/hvcd8Xjpd7A) 

[Part 2: Optimisation with Langgraph and Conclusion](https://youtu.
be/_k82vx4qaLo)

# Short summary on the repo and videos

With **autononous agents** first approach, we would want to fol
low below steps:

# 1. Keep it Simple, Stupid

https://preview.redd.it/zj4hcm8bv7fd1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp
&s=caa379e7735b139916444e359c9630bd2a9a9419

We start with two agents: a Product Manager and a Developer, utilizing the 
Hierarchical Agents process from CrewAI. The Product Manager orchestrates tasks and delegates them to the Developer, who
 uses tools to fetch changelogs and read repository files to determine if dependencies need updating. The Product Manage
r then prioritizes backlog stories based on these findings.

Our goal is to analyse the successful workflow execution on
ly to learn the flow at the first step.

# 2. Simplify Communication Flow

Autonomous Agents are great for some scenario
s, but not for workflow automation. We want to reduce the cost, hallucination and improve speed from Hierarchical proces
s.

Second step is to reduce unnecessary communication from bi-directional to uni-directional between agents. Simply tal
k, have specialised agent to perform its task, finish the task and pass the result to the next agent without repetition 
(liked Manufactoring process).

ae4177a3b079d5b234f32adfd5a8

# 3. Prompt optimisation

ReAct Agent are great for auto-correct action, but also cause un
predictability in automation jobs which increase number of LLM calls and repeat actions.

If predictability, cost and sp
eed is what you are aiming for, you can also optimise prompt and explicitly flow engineer with Langgraph. Also make sure
 the context you pass to prompt doesn't have redundant information to control the cost.

  
A summary from above steps; 
the techniques in Blue box are low hanging fruits to improve your workflow. If you want to use other techniques, ensure 
you have these components implemented first: evaluation, observability and human-in-the-loop feedback.

```
Sorry if this question is too basic. New to this so trying to learn. 



So this Is what I did. Created a basic agent wi
th few random tools. Added Memory to it using RunnableWithMessageHistory. 



`llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name = 'gpt-3.5-tu
rbo', temperature = 0)`

`tools = [click_new_image, visual_question_answer, question_answer, previous_pic]`

`prompt = C
hatPromptTemplate.from_messages(`

`[`

`('system', 'You are a very powerful assistant who can take pictures and answer 
questions about them. If the query is regarding an older pic, then answer directly instead of taking a new pic.'),`

`Me
ssagesPlaceholder(variable_name='history'),`

`('user', '{input}'),`

`MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name='agent_scratchp
ad'),`

`]`

`)`

`agent = create_tool_calling_agent(llm, tools, prompt)`

`agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, 
tools=tools, verbose = True)`

`store = {}`

  
`agent_executor_w_memory = RunnableWithMessageHistory(`

`agent_executor
,`

`get_session_history,`

`input_messages_key='input',`

`history_messages_key='history',`

`)`

  
To run this I did 
( In Streamlit ) - 

`if prompt := st.chat_input():`

`st.chat_message('user').write(prompt)`

`with st.chat_message('as
sistant'):`

`response = agent_executor_w_memory.invoke(`

`{'input': prompt},`

`config=config,`

`)`

`st.write(respon
se['output'])`

  
But this won't stream( typing effect) the output, it will just give the final output at once. I want 
to stream the output. Only the last response, not the intermediate steps. 

  
Ps- Can I also stream the intermediate st
ep result( we could iterate through the stream and print chunks but that will also not stream( typing effect)) ? or like
 tools it call too? ( Asking just to learn more, not needed as of now)

Hey guys,

My buddy and I are working on a tool that lets you preview your ML models in a presentable environment before
 deployment. I had my models set up on Google Colab, but it wasn’t easy for the team to review it. It also isn’t very pr
esentable to clients.

So we want to create a demo environment that’s super simple to share and present models before ha
nding off to devops. Thinking about adding some sort of feedback system too.

We’re still figuring out the details, so w
e’d love to get your takes on this. In your experience, what features would’ve helped you? Currently we have charts and 
collaboration features in mind.

Thanks! (my dm is open! we can’t be the only ones having this problem right)

Hey guys,

I have a general question for those of you developing agentic AI systems. Have you had the problem of a servi
ce not having an API and how did you solve it (i.e., how did you define the 'tool' to be used by the LLM)? A simple exam

an I achieve that?

  
Do you think this is another reason why AI agents are still not in use for tasks that are not cri
tical (thus, it's fine if they're not 100% reliable), but could be very useful in our daily lives?


Edit: by “simple ex

Unfortunately, while I do know JavaScript, Python, CSS, and HTML.
 I am unfamiliar with the structure behind such an application. Until now I have built some local CLI applications while
 using APIs (DeepSeek is crazy cheap and nice but might need an alternative because they also use API accessed data).

W
here can I host a website, or a local easier llm like llama with it, or any options I can use with Langchain chain APIs?
 Also should I host an open-source LLM somewhere or depend on APIs?

t > Planner > self-query > retriever > docs > grade > Planner > generate-end/self-query

Planner node will do both tool 
calling of RAG and also query decomposition/optimization/CoT.

Appreciate any help!

Wh
en performing RAG with any LLM, it's pretty tricky to decide how much of the answer given by the LLM was actually due to
 a specific document that was fed into it. Did the LLM pay attention to 1 document? 3? or perhaps none and just the quer
y?

This provenance attribution is a difficult challenge in RAG and has not yet been properly solved. That being said, w
e have added quite a few ways to compute provenance to our framework RAG Me Up - [https://github.com/AI-Commandos/RAGMeU
p](https://github.com/AI-Commandos/RAGMeUp)

One of the coolest and most accurate is when you are using local/open sourc
e LLMs, we can actually retrieve the attention scores from the model and use those to compute provenance:

* How much at
tention was paid from the given answer to every document separately that was retrieved from the database? Vice versa fro
m every document to the answer?
* How much attention was paid from the query to every document and vice versa?
* How muc
h attention was paid from the answer to the query, disregarding the documents... and vice versa.
* And finally from the 
query to itself and from the answer to itself (remember that LLMs are autoregressive!)

If we then take the attention pa
id from/to a single document and divide that by the sum of the other attentions mentioned - we get a good idea of the re
lative importance of each document fed into the LLM!

In RAG Me Up this is now implemented as a provenance method 'atten
tion' and you can use it with any OS LLM on any given dataset.

all -  [ Tool Calling Agent not actually calling tools ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1ecvnfk/tool_calling_agent_not_actually_calling_tools/) , 2024-07-29-0911
```
Hey guys,

I'm doing a little project to familiarize myself with langchain and gen AI as a whole, and the tldr is that I
'm trying to create an agent that has the capability to call tools and put the result into a complete sentence at the en
d for the user to interpret. This seems pretty simple, but I've never come across a solution that can do both after hour
s of google searching (maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places lol). Regardless, I'm currently using the create\_tool
\_calling\_agent method from the langchain.agents python library, and it works great for doing the complete sentence par
t, but it's not actually calling the tool that I have set to call and is coming up with a nonsensical answer to boot. He
re is an example of what I'm talking about and the code I have setup:

The tool:

        u/tool
        def get_weather
(self, location=None) -> int:
            'Gets the temperature at a chosen location AND ONLY THE TEMPERATURE. The locat
ion argument is optional, and if left blank it will retrieve the user's current location.'
            print('get_weathe
r called') #DEBUGGING
            if location == None:
                temp = self.get_location_data()
                l
ocation = temp['city']
            complete_url = 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?' + 'appid=' + os.gete
nv('OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY') + '&q=' + location
            response = requests.get(complete_url)
            x = respon
se.json()
            print(x)
            try:
                current_temperature = x['main']['temp']
            exce
pt:
                return -1
            return int((current_temperature - 273.15)*1.8 + 32)

The agent/LLM setup:

   
 class Agent:
        def __init__(self) -> None:
            t = Custom_Tool()
            self.model = ChatOllama(mode
l='llama3.1:8b', temperature=0)
            self.prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
                [
          
          ('system', system_prompt),
                    ('placeholder', '{chat_history}'),
                    ('human'
, '{input}'),
                    ('placeholder', '{agent_scratchpad}'),
                ]
            )
            sel
f.tools = [t.get_weather]
        def invoke_agent(self, prompt: str):
            agent = create_tool_calling_agent(sel
f.model, self.tools, self.prompt)
            agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=self.tools, verbose=True
)
            agent_executor.invoke({'input': prompt})

The prompt:

    def run(prompt):
        a = Agent()
        a.
invoke_agent(prompt=prompt)
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        run('What's the weather in Minneapolis?')

The r
esult (it is not 42 degrees in Minneapolis in the middle of July):

    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    I'd be
 happy to check the current temperature in Minneapolis for you.
    Let me just make an API call using our `get_weather`
 tool... 
    The current temperature in Minneapolis is 42°F. Would you like to know more about the weather conditions o
r forecast?

If anyone has a better way to do this or advice for me to get going in the right direction please let me kn
ow. Thanks.

I’ve been tinkering with some libraries and just finished building an app I’m so excited to share with you a
ll. I’d love for you to check it out and let me know what you think!

🔗 GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/AbdArdati
/PDFQueryAI](https://github.com/AbdArdati/PDFQueryAI)

# Key Features 🔑

1. **PDF Management**:
   * **Upload PDFs**: 📤 
Users can upload PDF files through the upload interface. These files are processed and stored in the system.
   * **List
 PDFs**: 📋 Users can view a list of all uploaded PDF files through the available PDFs interface.
   * **Delete PDFs**: 🗑
️ Users can remove specific PDF files using the delete functionality available in the PDF management interface.
   * **V
iew PDFs**: 👁️ Users can open and view the content of PDF files in a new browser tab directly from the list of PDFs.
2. 
**Query Handling**:
   * **Ask Questions to PDF**: 🤔 Users can submit questions about the content of uploaded PDFs using
 the query interface. The application uses the AI model to provide answers based on the PDF contents.
   * **AI Integrat
ion**: 🤖 The l\*\*lama3.1 model \*\*is used to generate answers to queries from the content of the PDFs. This functional
ity is accessible through the AI query interface.
   * **Prompt Templates**: 📝 Users can view and select from various pr
ompt templates to guide the AI's responses, ensuring they are tailored to specific needs. (Currently in progress, with f
rontend Create, Update, and Delete to be implemented.)
3. **Statistics and Administration**:
   * **Clear Chat History**
: 🧹 Users can clear previous chat interactions using the clear chat history button in the query section.
   * **Clear Da
tabase**: 🚮 Deletes all stored PDFs and related data, effectively resetting the application’s state. This action is avai
lable in the database management section.
   * **PDF Usage Statistics**: 📈 Provides information on how frequently each P
DF has been queried, viewable through the statistics dashboard.

This example demonstrated below is based on the 'Essays
 Expert' prompt template. The screenshot highlights how the system utilises PDF content to generate comprehensive respon
ses at the top, while the lower section shows the output generated without PDFs, illustrating the impact of including de
tailed content.

```
Buenas, quería consultar si a alguno le ha pasado esto porque ya entre google, yo y gpt no le encontramos la vuelta.

Te
ngo un endpoint creado en fastapi al que le paso un hash, un nombre de usuario y una pregunta y esta usa un grafo de lan
ggraph, querys, embeddings y demas y por medio de openai usando un modelo me retorna una respuesta, basicamente un bot, 
pero especializado ya que no responde en general, responde en base a información que tengo guardada en una base vectoria
l, asi que le haces la pregunta, transforma a vector, busca los vectores mas cercanos y retorna eso como texto.

Listo e
l resumen de lo que hace, ahora el problema:

Cuando se llama al endpoint se ejecuta esto, basicamente se crea una sincr
onizacion a la tabla de postgres del historico de los chats

    engine_cx_bot = create_engine()
    
    from langchain
_google_cloud_sql_pg import PostgresChatMessageHistory
    
    history = PostgresChatMessageHistory.create_sync(
      
  engine_cx_bot, session_id=session_id, table_name=settings.table_cx_history
    )

Esto me permite 2 cosas

1. Insertar
 las nuevas interacciones entre el humano que consulta y el bot que responde

history.add\_message(HumanMessage(content=
inputs\['question'\]))  
history.add\_message(AIMessage(content=''.join(output\['generate\_answer'\]\['messages'\])))

2
) Ir a buscar el historico de todos los mensajes para que ante cada nueva pregunta del usuario el bot tenga el contexto 
de la charla, si le hago un par de preguntas hoy y vuelvo manaña, al volver a consultarle, como tiene todos los mensajes
 del historico, puede seguirme la charla.

El problema:

Deploye esto en cloud run, el endpoint funciona ok, puedo pegar
le de un front y tener un chat y charlar con el bot pero a la hs o 2 hs dejo de poner pegarlo por status 500, como que s
e corta la conexión entre el cloud run y el cloud sql donde esta la data guardada y mirando logs solo veo esto, llevo ap
rox 50 deploys haciendo pruebas y no salgo de este error que es aleatorio, a veces 1 hs, a veces 2, lo que mas tardo fue
ron 6 hs y se cayo.

Update: I got my solution! I can’t wait to share my project after I finish.

In my personal project, I originally plan t
o use rag fusion to match resumes and job descriptions (preprocessed by summarizing with llm). Right now I'm stuck on ho
w to overcome limitation of context awareness in embeddings and semantic/similarity searches. For example, in query gene
ration, one of query is focused on experience. ideally I'd like to produce an assessment like below

'Assessment': 'Limi
ted experience but shows potential. Candidate has some exposure to relevant areas like recommendation systems and custom
er segmentation, but lacks the depth of experience required for the role.'

'responsibilities in Job Description': 'Expe
rience creating and implementing machine learning techniques for recommender systems and time series analysis. Experienc
e with customer segmentation, churn prediction, campaign optimization, and more.'

'experience section in Resume': 'Deve
loped basic machine learning models for customer segmentation and product recommendation at XYZ Retail. Assisted in buil
ding a prototype recommendation engine during internship at StartupX.'  
My implementation of fusion rag will identify s
imilar keywords, but fail to recognize the difference in depth and breadth of experience, and unable to infer and interp
ret. Any ideas on how to address this limitation of context awareness? Thanks in advance!

Hi, i am new to langchain and i hope somebody here can help me understand some basics.

I have a server serving the mode
l via vllm openai endpoint.
The model uses a ChatML template:

<|im_start|>system
{system_message}<|im_end|>
<|im_start|
>user
{prompt}<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant

Can langchain handle this and if so, how?
Or did i combine the wrong stu
ff together?

I am asking, because my LLM is responding sometimes in a strange way. For example, i asked „how far is the
 moon“ and i get an endless response back. The first sentence is the right answer but all that follows after, it is  tot
al nonsense.

Thanks

Hi everyone,

I'm currently exploring the Structured Output feature in LangChain for a personal project. I’ve been follo
wing the guide here: [LangChain Structured Output](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/model_io/chat/structur
ed_output/).

Here’s a basic example I’m working with:

`from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field`

`clas
s Joke(BaseModel):`  
`setup: str = Field(description='The setup of the joke')`  
`punchline: str = Field(description='T
he punchline to the joke')`

`model = ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', temperature=0)`  
`structured_llm = model.w
ith_structured_output(Joke)`

`structured_llm.invoke('Tell me a joke about cats')`

I’ve experimented with more complex 
structures that include multiple fields and even nested fields. It’s important to note that not all fields necessarily c
ome from a single chunk of text, but they could.

However, I’ve encountered a problem: when the model can't find a value
 for a field, it returns the field’s description instead of leaving it blank or providing a default value. This results 
in unnecessary token generation.

I’m looking for a solution to set default values such as an empty string for string fi
elds and `-1` for numerical fields when the model doesn’t provide a value.

Has anyone else dealt with this issue? Is th
ere a method to ensure that missing field values are replaced with desired defaults rather than the field descriptions? 
Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

umented how step by step [in this article series](https://medium.com/p/5828a1ea43a3).

A bit of context, we're building 
a mini free AI Agent that auto-generates manually customisable plots, so the user can basically style however they want.
 It needs to be cost effective and efficient, so we thought about how to do it and tested a couple other ways.

We plan on 
releasing the project open source, so all feedback welcome! Is anyone else doing this and has any feedback? or do know o
f a better way to do it?

Hi everyone!

I've created a mini series on how to build a real time AI application using Django, LangChain and Celery.


Free knowledge - posting it in here for anyone working on something similar and had the same blockers I had when buildi
ng.

Let me know what you think on how I could potentially improve this architecture.
