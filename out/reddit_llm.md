I created a starter template to help developers build full-stack apps with AI features: image ge

It's built on Next.js + Tailwind for the front-end. Supports Supabas
e for database and authentication, and Stripe for payments. Also comes with built-in components for a landing page and d
ashboard.

For the AI integrations, I use Replicate for image gen, gpt-3.5 for text gen, Supapase pgvector as the vector
 store, and LangChain for LLM management.

I've put up the template along with tons of documentation and videos here: [h

Hello everyone!

I want to share a project for which Python support was just added recently:

This is a tool that allows users to visualize the complexity of a 
code base using a 3D force-directed graph:

* It will take a Python executable/library's entrypoint and calculate it's d
ependencies based on the import statements.
* It will recursively crawl the import statements looking for more import st
atements in the imported files, building recursively a file dependency graph.
* It will render the graph using a force-d
irected layout, and all the crawled files will be placed in a three-dimensional space simulating some attraction/repulsi
on forces based on the dependencies between them.
* There's already some samples using well known open-source projects t
hat are quite surprising:

In my head I was
 thinking of detecting if it has lots of big images (when it's a scan), then using a vision model over those images, and
 then summarising the outputs. If there are no images, then just extracting texts (potentially handing tables slightly d
ifferently).

```
Loks like Copilot Studio is being rolled out (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio
) with an impressive looking no code/out of the box RAG solution.

There is a phenomenal amount of development and activ
ity in the Open Source RAG world (e.g Langchain, Llamaindex, etc), which I am a great supporter of FYI.

However, what s
eems strange is that this no code out of the box solution (Copilot Studio - just as an example of one) seems overwhelmin
gly to be the better option if you wanted to build a RAG app i.e If you compare the cost to build and productionise a cu
stom RAG app vs the cost of using Copilot Studio, it's almost an order of magnitude lower (no matter how you cut it with
 the developer time and duration). 

My question is, it seems to me we are moving towards a situation where enterprise s
olutions will make custom RAG apps redundant (not in all cases of course, but most cases), however there seems to be ver
y little discussion of this relative to the activity in the open source community. Do people agree this is a likely scen
ario? 

Obviously there will be exceptions…but on most use cases I don’t see how you can compete with an instant/minimal
 setup, low cost, highly scalable RAG solution.

Sorry if this is common knowledge, I’m new to using LLMs and all my experience until now has been with Chat GPT using Op
en AI’s web ui. I want to explore other language models especially some of the opensource ones like Mixtral 8B etc 

Is 
there a GUI tool I can use to keep all these models in one place? And manage things like context? For example I will hav
e seperate system
prompts for “Programmer”, “Lawyer”, “Advise giver” etc and depending on what the mood calls for I can 
select the most appropriate one? And also I can load context from memory to pick up a conversation from where I last lef
t off?

I believe Langchain can do this but it looks like it’s not really a UI but a lib you need to install and write s
cripts for. I’m ok with that cause I’m a developer by trade but I was hoping to start off with something more turn-key, 
like select this or that model from a drop-down and have all your saved context appear on the left etc in the form of a 
web or desktop app. 

Is there such a tool out there people can recommend? Thanks in advance!

* One native function

all -  [ React prompting Mistral or Mixtral ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MistralAI/comments/191wg3i/react_prompting_mistral_or_mixtral/) , 2024-01-11-0910
```
I am trying to create an agent using tools by using react prompting technique for mixtral:8x7b-instruct-v0.1-q4\_K\_M. I
 am mixing langchain zeroshot agent strategy and the strategy from this page [https://www.pinecone.io/learn/mixtral-8x7b
/](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/mixtral-8x7b/) using JSON answers leading to instructions like:

    You are an XY agen
t capable of using a variety of tools to answer a question. ...
    
    
    Here are the tools:
    - ...
    - ...
  
  
    To use these tools you must always respond in JSON format containing `'tool_name'` and `'input'` key-value pairs!
 For example, ...
    
    ```json
    {
        'tool_name': 'sql_get_similar_examples',
        'input': 'How many mac
hines are there?'
    }
    ```
    
    Use the following format:
    
    User: the input question you must answer 
  
  Thought: you should always think about what to do 
    Action: the action to take in the JSON format listed above, whe
reas 'tool_name' should be one of [...] and 'input' should be the input of the tool
    Observation: the result of the a
ction 
    ... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) 
    Thought: I now know the final answer 
    Final
 Answer: the final answer to the original input question by using the Final Answer tool in JSON format   
    
    Begin
!  
    
    User: {input} 
    Thought: {first thought}
    Action: ```json
    {
        'tool_name': 

It actually wo
rks quite well for the first couple of Thought/Action/Observation iterations. When the llm wants to call a tool I run it
 and append the llm answer as well as the tool's result (which can be quite long) with a new '\\nThought: ' string to th
e prompt and run the merged prompt again. The llm then comes up with a new Thought and Action.

Still, after a couple of
 iterations the llm somehow looses the whole context and does not call tools anymore. It seems to lose its purpose of an
swering the user question but simply describes the last tool output in the 'Thought:' section. May it be, the prompt get
s too long for Mixtral to follow the react pattern?

Have you got any experience/advice for using Mixtral as react agent
?

Hi 

I'm fairly new to this so pardon the basic question, I poked around this community but couldn't find the response s
o some help would be kindly appreciated. Here's the situation:

I'm using RAG to build an assistant for my employer. Cur
rently I've set up a chatbot that uses Langchain, OpenAI embedding, Deeplake as a vector database. And my current setup 
works well from a demo perspective where I can show the chatbot responding over some code files and giving some value. H
owever, when I combine other data types into the database (after chunking and embedding) such as my companies Confluence
 documentation, it doesn't seem to mesh well with the codebase data. I believe i should be doinf this in a way where the
 vector database has files stored in such a way that makes it clear for the retriever what part of the vector database c
ame from a codebase and what part came from documentation (confluence) and they need to be referenced together but store
d seperately to work effienciently. 

Moreover i need some kind of an agent setup which can identify whether to respond 
with context from the codebase's vector files or from the confluence documentations vector files or an appropriate combi
nation of both (that would be ideal). . 

It would also be extremely powerful if I could also somehow add on the compani
es PDFs, word files, PowerPoint, excel files etc. Into the mix and have it all be part of the same RAG flow. 

I would a
ppreciate some guidance from people who have done similar or the knowhow to solve this.

From a corpus of text, how can you detect emerging topics and their evolution through time?

Introducing Temporal Augmen
ted Retrieval (TAR). (built in the context of buildspace n&w s4)

TAR is an open-source advanced RAG approach that aims 
to factor in the dynamic and temporal aspects of textual data when performing retrieval.

It allows us to understand the
 evolution of discussed topics over time.

The idea behind this project is to open the debate regarding the current limi
tations of RAG methods

This first approach has been built without using RAG frameworks (like Jerry Liu’s langchain) and
 focuses on financial tweets

Hey folks, 

So I'm playing around with the agent framework Autogen and I'm trying to create agents by providing it cust
om tools to use. These custom tools are defined in the langchain framework. Furthermore, I am using open source LLM mode
ls like Mistral, LLAMA, Mixtral etc.

In my experience, I have been unable to get the Autogen+LocalLLM framework to iden
tify the right tools to use given the prompt. However it does a fantastic job with the GPT model. 

Please note that my 
goal is for the agent to mandatorily use the tools provided and not come up with its own code. And the agent should figu
re out the right tool to use. 

I have been very explicit with my prompting, despite which I am unable to get this to wo
rk.

Any thoughts and suggestions? Please let me know ! Please share your experiences as well. Cheers !

M
y current plan is to use OpenAI as the primary language learning model, focusing on affordability. I am considering inte
grating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and LangChain for enhanced functionality. However, I'm quite perplexed abou
t choosing an appropriate vector database, as many options appear costly. The goal is to keep this system live and acces
sible for student usage without breaking the bank.

I'm also looking into open-source embedding models to pair with the 
vector database. Pinecone has caught my attention, but its pricing seems steep for our budget.

Does anyone have recomme
ndations or tips on affordable yet effective tools and strategies for this project? Any insights on vector databases sui
table for educational use, or ways to optimize cost without compromising quality, would be greatly appreciated.

Thank y
