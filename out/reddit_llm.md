Reaching out to the community, I was wondering how [LangChain](https://www.linkedin.com/company/langchain/) has helper m
odules like from langchain\_community.document\_loaders import YoutubeLoader to allow transcribing of youtube videos, is
 there an agreement between Langchain and youtube to allow this or this is under a non-commercial use-case license ?

How would you make this possible?

My approach:

Hi everyone, 

I'm what you might call a “novice” developer. My company has some AI needs, so I'm looking for a solution
 that lets me orchestrate some AI models, add prompts when generating text, and connect to some data. It's pretty simple
 stuff, I think. 

I know how to code a little in Python, but I don't understand much about LangChain, which seems to me
 to be for developers with a little experience (or maybe I'm just too dumb).

I've come across a platform that seems to 
meet my needs. It's called Eden AI (www.edenai.co). They bundle lots of AI APIs into one, and then recently they've made
 it possible to create your own custom AI API with a visual workflow. You can then make an API call on this workflow. 


But before using this in more depth, I'd like to hear your feedback. Has anyone used this? Do you have any alternatives 
for me?

Cheers

all -  [ Built llmtest: A Semantic Testing Framework for LLMs (Need Senior Engineering Help!) ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1grtaol/built_llmtest_a_semantic_testing_framework_for/) , 2024-11-16-0913
```
Hey r/langchain! I've built something I think could be really useful, but I need senior engineering help to make it prod
uction-ready. I'm a programming noob, only been writing code for 20 months. It is at an extremely early stage but I thin
k the idea has potential.

What is llmtest?

A semantic testing framework that uses LLMs to validate semantic equivalenc
e in test outputs. Instead of exact matching (which doesn't work with LLM outputs), it uses LLMs themselves to check if 
outputs are semantically equivalent.

Why I Built It

I got frustrated with not being able to properly test LLM applicat
ions (I don't trust my code, and I trust LLMs even less). I thought 'If we need to validate semantic meaning, why not us
e an LLM to do it?' So I built a basic framework that does exactly that.

Current State

Here's a basic example:

`from 
llmtest.core.semantic_assert import SemanticAssertion`

`def test_my_llm_function(asserter):`

`result = my_llm_function
()`  
`asserter.assert_semantic_match(actual=result,`  
`expected_behavior='Should provide a coherent answer`  
`about P
ython')`

Why I Need Help

While I've got a working test (I think, it passed the test for the test in the test package b
ecause the only way to make tests good is to write tests to test your tests) and basic functionality, I'm relatively new
 to programming and need senior engineering guidance to make this production-ready. Looking for experienced engineers wh
o can:

1. Help lead the technical direction
2. Guide architecture decisions
3. Implement best practices
4. Make this pr
oduction-ready

Why This Matters

Every LLM application needs semantic testing, but current solutions either:

* Use exa
ct matching (doesn't work)
* Use complex metrics (hard to implement)
* Don't address semantic equivalence directly

Curr
ent Features

* Semantic equivalence testing using GPT-4o
* pytest integration
* Basic error handling
* Environment-base
d configuration

Links

* GitHub: [https://github.com/Shredmetal/llmtest](https://github.com/Shredmetal/llmtest)

Would 
love to connect with senior engineers who:

1. See the potential in this approach
2. Want to help shape the future of LL
M testing
3. Are interested in mentoring while building something useful

I'm happy to remain an active core contributor
 while learning from more experienced developers (I'm way in over my head here!).

Edit:

Someone asked how it worked so
:

For me now, testing an LLM app for me involves spinning the LLM service up, spinning up a frontend, and talking to th
e bot. The idea is to take me out of the equation.

What do I do when I talk to the bot? I expect a particular type of r
esponse based on the system message / any other templates I use.

I thought that this thought process can be replicated 
by an LLM (however it does it, thought or not).

So this testing package:

1. Takes your LLM app output
2. Takes the exp
ected behaviour
3. Gives it to an LLM to check if it matches semantically
4. Gets the response from the LLM whether PASS
 or FAIL + reason for failure
5. Then raises an error or doesn't raise an error.

For example (these are test cases from
 the tests for my semantic assertion test):

This test correctly does not throw any semantic assertion error:

        d
ef test_basic_semantic_match(self, asserter):
            '''Test basic semantic matching'''
            actual = 'The s
ky is blue'
            expected = 'A statement about the color of the sky'
    
            asserter.assert_semantic_ma
tch(actual, expected)

This test successfully throws an assertion error:

        def test_semantic_mismatch(self, asser
ter):
            '''Test semantic mismatch raises correct exception'''
            actual = 'The sky is blue'
         
   expected = 'A statement about the weather forecast'
    
            with pytest.raises(SemanticAssertionError) as ex
cinfo:
                asserter.assert_semantic_match(actual, expected)
    
            assert 'Semantic assertion fail
ed' in str(excinfo.value)

For the attached images, the LLM was asked to generate:

`'''You are a friendly greeting bot.
 Your task is to generate`

`warm, personalized greetings. The greeting should:`

`1. Use the person's name`

`2. Be fri
endly and welcoming`

`3. Include a question about their wellbeing`

`4. Keep responses concise (max 2 sentences)'''`

T
his was the expected behavior:

    '''
    A polite greeting that:
    1. Addresses the person by name (Alice)
    2. A
sks about their wellbeing
    '''

Please refer to the attached images - the testing behaved as expected.

[Test failure
 because the expected behaviour did not match the actual behaviour \(The LLM greeted Alice instead of John, which was wh

Hi guys,  
I'm learning AI and currently working on a RAG project using complex pdfs ( by complex I mean pdfs that conta
ins texts , images, and tables ).

I'm using gpt-4o-mini as the LLM coz its cheap. Currently, I'm just focusing on text 
and table extraction and QA .

My RAG Pipeline looks something like this :

1. Llamaparse to convert PDF to Markdown
2. 
OpenAIEmbedding 3 Large for converting pdf chunks to vectors
3. Pinecone as Vector Store
4. Cohere ( rerank-english-v3.0
 ) as Reranker

I've created the setup using create\_history\_aware\_retriever, create\_retrieval\_chain, RunnableWithMe
ssageHistory classes from Langchain. So, my app is currently a PDF RAG chain.

I'm facing some problems in my current se
tup.

1. Because my pdf has tables, some of the tables are present in a single page only and are getting extracted as ta
ble properly. Others are splitted between pages. This is resulting in incorrect answers. How do I fix this ?
2. When I a
sk the app to calculate sum of column values of a table, it is not able to do so. GPT 4o-mini can reason and do mathemat
ical calculations, why my app can't ?
3. I've added in system prompt to always return tables in tabular format but still
 I get table data in list format around 20-25% of the time.

How can I fix these problems in my app? Is this time to swi
tch to a PDF ReAct agent ( Langgraph ) ?

I've posted this in Langchain subreddit too as I'm using Langchain, posting he
re as I'm developing a RAG app. Hope you guys don't mind. Thanks!

Hi guys,  
I'm learning AI and currently working on a RAG project using complex pdfs ( by complex I mean pdfs that conta
ins texts , images, and tables ).

I'm using gpt-4o-mini as the LLM coz its cheap. Currently, I'm just focusing on text 
and table extraction and QA .

My RAG Pipeline looks something like this :

1. Llamaparse to convert PDF to Markdown
2. 
OpenAIEmbedding 3 Large for converting pdf chunks to vectors
3. Pinecone as Vector Store
4. Cohere ( rerank-english-v3.0
 ) as Reranker

I've created the setup using create\_history\_aware\_retriever, create\_retrieval\_chain, RunnableWithMe
ssageHistory classes from Langchain. So, my app is currently a PDF RAG chain.

I'm facing some problems in my current se

```
I've been working in AI development for a while now, first at FAANG, and now in startups. IMO, when architecting your LL
M application, you need to optimize for being able to iterate quickly.



LLM Development involves being able to constan
tly try out different prompts, models, call-chaining, RAG datasets, and more to see what works. This requires a tech-sta
ck that helps you efficiently try out different combinations. That’s why I’m working on an open-source framework, Palico
, that optimizes for the iterative nature of LLM Development.



Palico is an opinionated framework that gives you an in
tegrated system for building, evaluating, and deploying your LLM Application. The “opinionated” part of the framework ba
kes in best-practices I’ve seen by talking to hundreds of LLM Devs, as well as my experience working in AI for the last 
few years.



You can checkout the framework here: [https://github.com/palico-ai/palico-ai](https://github.com/palico-ai

```
Hi all - recently I got triggered by seeing the the Nth “AI agent stack”/”AI agents market map” made by a VC features a 
bunch of companies I’ve never heard up in categories that make no sense. [Sharing what I see as the real “agents stack”]
(https://www.letta.com/blog/ai-agents-stack), from the perspective of having been building an agents framework and worki
ng with a lot of different providers for components like LLMs, tool calling, storage, and sandboxing.

https://preview.r
edd.it/mehxo2w55y0e1.jpg?width=5100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5e684f8f64485a551e22557ed0f1effd3cd9cd7e

In my opinion, tod
ay’s tech stack for building AI agents into three key layers: (1) agent hosting/serving, (2) agent frameworks, (3) LLM m
odels & storage.

The (3) LLM model and storage layer is now relatively static - I don’t see a lot of new players, and t
here are clear winners in segments of the market.

For (2) agent frameworks, there’s been a ton of development in the pa
st 6 months in both general purpose frameworks, as well as specialized components (e.g. tool-use, sandboxing, and memory
). I think as the space matures we’ll see a lot more players here, and even more specialization - over time, agents will
 probably be built from modular components leveraging different providers.

The layer of the stack thats still the most 
“up in the air” is hosting (1) - different frameworks have taken very different approaches to what a hosted agent should
 look like, from how agent state (e.g. memories, message history, user data, etc.) are persisted, the API for interactin
g with agents is, and approach to handling tool execution (arbitrary code the agent can call).

I'm sure I missed come c
ool projects, so would love to learn if there's other agent hosting/tool frameworks out there since it was quite sparse 
when we did our research.

```
[https://github.com/katanemo/arch](https://github.com/katanemo/arch) \- is an AI-native infrastructure primitive to buil
d fast, personalized agents using APIs. Specifically, Arch is an intelligent prompt gateway designed to protect, observe
, and personalize LLM applications (agents, assistants, co-pilots) with your APIs.

Engineered with purpose-built LLMs, 
Arch handles the critical but undifferentiated tasks related to the handling and processing of prompts, including detect
ing and rejecting [jailbreak](https://github.com/verazuo/jailbreak_llms) attempts, intelligently calling 'backend' APIs 
to fulfill the user's request represented in a prompt, routing to and offering disaster recovery between upstream LLMs, 
and managing the observability of prompts and LLM interactions in a centralized way.

Arch is built on (and by the core 
contributors of) [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) with the belief that:

>

**Core Features**:

* Built on [Env
oy](https://envoyproxy.io): Arch runs alongside application servers, and builds on top of Envoy's proven HTTP management
 and scalability features to handle ingress and egress traffic related to prompts and LLMs.
* Function Calling for fast 
Agents and RAG apps. Engineered with purpose-built [LLMs](https://huggingface.co/collections/katanemo/arch-function-66f2
09a693ea8df14317ad68) to handle fast, cost-effective, and accurate prompt-based tasks like function/API calling, and par
ameter extraction from prompts.
* Prompt [Guard](https://huggingface.co/collections/katanemo/arch-guard-6702bdc08b889e4b
ce8f446d): Arch centralizes prompt guardrails to prevent jailbreak attempts and ensure safe user interactions without wr
iting a single line of code.
* Traffic Management: Arch routes outbound LLM calls to OpenAI (and other LLMs), offering s
mart retries, automatic cutover, and resilient upstream connections for continuous availability.
* Standards-based Obser
vability: Arch uses the W3C Trace Context standard to enable complete request tracing across applications, ensuring comp
atibility with observability tools, and provides metrics to monitor latency, token usage, and error rates, helping optim
ize AI application performance.

Hi!

I have not been convinced yet that 'agents' provide any inherent value themselves other than providing a wrapper ar
ound LLMs that contain some state (prompts, context, etc) and/or logic (call back functions otherwise called 'tools'). B
efore agents were released, we were all writing classes that encapsulated this state/logic - a typical exercise to perfo
rm around any model. 

The hype definitely helped push the industry forward while there was slowing progress in terms of
 base models, however, I am reluctant to take a dependency on any new 'agents' framework into my code base when we can a
chieve the same results with little work.

```
I'm trying to run multiple nodes in parallel to reduce latency but don't want to have to wait for all nodes to finish if
 I determine from early ones that finish that I don't need all of them.

Here's a simple graph example to illustrate the
 problem. It starts with 2 nodes in parallel: setting a random number and getting city preference from some source. If t
he random number is 1-50, 'NYC' is assigned as city regardless of city preference, but if random number is 51-100, the c
ity preference is used.

    class State(TypedDict):
        random_number: int
        city: str
        city_preferenc
e: str
    
    graph: StateGraph = StateGraph(state_schema=State)
    
    
    def set_random_number(state):
        r
andom_number = 1  # Hardcode to 1 for testing
        print(f'SET RANDOM NUMBER: {random_number}')
        return {'rand
om_number': random_number}
    
    
    def get_city_preference(state):
        time.sleep(4)  # Simulate a time-consum
ing operation
        city_preference = 'Philadelphia'
        print(f'GOT CITY PREFERENCE: {city_preference}')
        
return {'city_preference': city_preference}
    
    
    def assign_city(state):
        city = 'NYC' if state['random_
number'] <= 50 else state['city_preference']
        print(f'ASSIGNED CITY: {city}')
        return {'city': city}
    

    
    graph.add_node('set_random_number', set_random_number)
    graph.add_node('get_city_preference', get_city_prefe
rence)
    graph.add_node('assign_city', assign_city)
    
    graph.add_edge(START, 'set_random_number')
    graph.add_
edge(START, 'get_city_preference')
    graph.add_edge('set_random_number', 'assign_city')
    graph.add_edge('get_city_p
reference', 'assign_city')
    graph.add_edge('assign_city', END)
    
    graph_compiled = graph.compile(checkpointer=M
emorySaver())
    
    input = {'random_number': 0, 'city': 'Nowhere', 'city_preference': 'N/A'}
    config = {
        
'configurable': {'thread_id': 'test'},
        'recursion_limit': 50,
    }
    state = graph_compiled.invoke(input=inpu
t, config=config)
    
    

The problem with the above and various conditional edge implementations I've tried, is that
 the graph always waits to assign city until the slow get\_city\_preference node completes even if the set\_random\_numb
er node has already returned a number that doesn't require city preference (i.e., 1-50).

Is there a way to stop a node 
running in parallel from blocking execution of subsequent nodes if that node's output isn't needed later in the graph?

Hey LangChain community! Just coming here to ask a question and for some opinions or advice.

I'm building a Reporting A
ssistant. The vision is that I will use LangGraph to create something along the lines of this https://blog.langchain.dev
/data-viz-agent/ - Basically an agentic system that allows users to communicate with their data and create visualization
s. The agentic system throughout it's many nodes will generate a SQL query based on the DB schema and user's request in 
natural language, execute it, and then display a graph and allow the user to further iterate on that graph using natural
 language. I have an initial attempt at the SQL generation in place and it is working successfully on a small dataset.


From here, I am just considering the risks more seriously of opening up a database to users like this. I have concerns a
bout the potential for this system generating (regardless of however much prompt engineering that I use) heavy queries, 
things like SQL injection, invalid SQL queries, the ability to query out outside of the user's account's scope, etc. 

I
 will have guardrails in place wherever I can think (for example I have a node to validate + optimize the generated SQL 
query, and two other conditional nodes to validate structured outputs for 2 specific nodes in my graph) + I will have so
me system guardrails with AWS Bedrock in place + most likely guardrails on top of guardrails to validate outputs with th
is being a high stakes project that needs to work and be reliable. Do you think that with the current state of models to
day and the inevitable unpredictability (however rare) that attempting this using a LLM agentic system could be a viable
 solution/product for a large scale production database?

I am working on a RAG chatbot which answers user questions with the content of a PDF file uploaded. I am used to pulling

gging Face, not on Ollama. I followed the instruction here: [Hugging Face | 🦜️🔗 LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/
docs/integrations/text_embedding/huggingfacehub/): 

`pip install sentence_transformer`

`from langchain_huggingface.emb

 using a model from OllamaEmbeddings, the same procedure was done within 15 seconds.

cing with simple projects in Google Colab.   
At the same time, I'm learning n8n and building workflows based on tutoria
ls and my ideas. The problem is, I want to move forward and build a more advanced project to improve my knowledge of LLM
s and agents, but I'm not sure what to build or what to learn next.   
Could you suggest some ideas or guides on what to
 focus on next? Any advice on what I can build that will be useful in the real world would be appreciated

Is the search feature from GPT available in some way within the OpenAI API? If not is there a way to implement it? Like 
a langchain method or something adjacent?

all -  [ [Question] - Need help with a project ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1gqsv1r/question_need_help_with_a_project/) , 2024-11-16-0913
```
I'm working on a project with LLM agents. I am a complete noob with LLMs so please bear with me. 

Context :   
Part A :
  
I have a bunch of agents. Think of these agents as users and there is some context unique to each agent. The prompt f
or each agent here would be more or less the same, except a text variable used in the prompt would change. The problem w
ith this is that I can have an arbitrarily large number of agents. However, I am not looping to give feedback back to th
e agents. 

The processes are as follows :   
Process 1 = User\_i +context\_i -> Agent\_i -> Does something on List X ->
 Value Y  
Process 2 = context(set of all context\_i) + Agent\_generate -> List X 

Here I could probably make use of a 
fixed number of agents like 10 and just have them rotate through all the users because we are only concerned with the Va
lue Y from each agent.   


Questions:   
1. Could I run these agents in parallel? If yes, are there any resources that 
I could refer to? Also, my default option would be to use Ollama 3.2 locally on my MBP(2022) M2 Chip with 8GB RAM. Howev
er, I think this might pose a problem as the number of users grows. Is it a good idea to go further with this idea or sh
ould I use OpenAI? 

Part B:   
The same situation as above but now we are adding a new process :   
  
def main\_proces
s(user\_set, context\_set):  
\# Step 1: Generate agent and List X based on combined context (Process 2)  
agent\_genera
te = generate\_agent(context\_set)  
list\_X\_ = generate\_list\_X(agent\_generate)  
  
\# Step 2 & Step 3: For each us
er, initialize agent, operate on List X, check A condition to trigger Process 3  
results = \[\]  
for user, context in 
user\_set:  
agent = initialize\_agent(user, context)  
result\[agent\] = operate\_on\_list\_X\_Cond(agent)  
  
   \# C
heck and trigger Process 3 if condition A is met  
   if calculate\_metric\_A(results\_X) < 90:  
list\_X = agent\_gener
ate(list\_X)  
  
\# Process 4: Operate on List X' and calculate final metrics A' and B'  
result\_X = operate\_on\_list
\_X\_prime(agent, list\_X)  
return results

Questions :   
1. Is there a better way to do part B? Because I am using ag
ent\_i to validate and calculate scores I need to have as many agents as I have users. This could be troublesome. Is the
re a neat way to do this?

2. I would really appreciate it if I could get pointers to terms that I can look up to implem
ent these experiments better. For, example, I think langchain might be something that could help me. Again the documenta
tion seems more advanced and I feel like I might not need. Can you help me scope the project tools and the things I woul
d need?

all -  [ How to choose device for vector store similarity search and reranking ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1gqlu01/how_to_choose_device_for_vector_store_similarity/) , 2024-11-16-0913
```
Hi, I'm new to langchain or genai tools, so I'm trying to understand how things work..

I don't know why a similarity se
arch on a vectorstore (I used faiss-cpu with langchain) and reranking using RankLLMRerank & ContextualCompressionRetriev
er would use my local gpu by default. 

For embeddings model while building vector store, it seemed that the embedding m
odel is downloaded and cached locally (not sure if it's general behavior or because I was using embedding model from hug
ging face).

Is it langchain side or something else (faiss etc) that requires local run of those model? Is there any oth
er way exist?

I get that it's advantageous to have gpu when loading and running models locally, but I'd like to know if
 it can also work with cpu only as my instance in cloud may not have gpu (just by choice).

Is it possible to choose dev
ice to cpu only? Would it be prohibitively slow?

```
Hi guys

 I'm looking to build an app that uses a PDF as a knowledge base and allows users to upload additional PDFs. Th
e goal is for the app to provide responses based on the combined content of these PDFs. The documents are quite long (ar
ound 100 pages) and are in Polish.

I attempted to use the OpenAI Playground to upload PDFs for Assistants, but it faile
d miserably. 

I'm new to AI and unsure whether to use something like LangChain or another tool. I came across tools lik
e Upstage, which seems to be a bit better.

 I know how to code and will manage to follow any stack needed.

 Could anyo
ne suggest what tools or frameworks I should use to build this app? 

Thanks!

Barely receiving any callbacks, having applied to at least 200 roles. Being an international student, I understand needi
ng visa sponsorship plays a big factor. However, I want to make sure that I am doing everything right as far as my resum
e is concerned.

I am currently in the first year of my master's degree and have been applying to internships since July
. The only OA's I have received are from HFT's, which I suspect are sent automatically right after application. I have b
een applying to positions everywhere and have no issues with relocation or remote work. I have not restricted my applica
tions in any way and have been applying to positions at big tech, startup, non-tech firms and any organization that has 
opened up roles for Summer 2025 internships

Please let me know what I can improve on my resume

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Open-source declarative framework to build LLM applications - looking for contributors ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gkpazh/p_opensource_declarative_framework_to_build_llm/) , 2024-11-16-0913
```
I've been building LLM-based applications, and was super frustated with all major frameworks - langchain, autogen, crewA
I, etc. They also seem to introduce a pile of unnecessary abstractions. It becomes super hard to understand what's going
 behind the curtains even for very simple stuff.

[So I just published this open-source framework GenSphere.](https://gi
thub.com/octopus2023-inc/gensphere) The idea is have something like **Docker for LLMs**. You build applications with YAM
L files, that define an execution graph. Nodes can be either LLM API calls, regular function executions or other graphs 
themselves. Because you can nest graphs easily, building complex applications is not an issue, but at the same time you 
don't lose control.

You basically code in YAML, stating what are the tasks that need to be done and how they connect. O
ther than that, you only write individual python functions to be called during the execution. No new classes and abstrac
tions to learn.

Its all open-source. **Now I'm looking for contributors** to adapt the framework for cycles and conditi
onal nodes - which would allow full-fledged agentic system building! Pls reach out  if you want to contribute, there are
 tons of things to do!

PS: [you can read the detailed docs here,](https://gensphere.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) And go o
ver this quick [Google Colab tutorial.](https://github.com/octopus2023-inc/gensphere/blob/main/examples/gensphere_tutori
