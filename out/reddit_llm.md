Hey all ü§ñ

I wanted to share this project I've been working on with the LangChain community. It was very exploratory and
 I got a change to work from figuring out system prompts and how to use the AgentExecutor to being able to utilize LangG
raph to take my project to the next level.

Here's a summary of the tech used:

* LangChain **:** At the time, OpenAI‚Äôs 
Python package was in early development. LangChain, with its large and active developer community, was a natural choice.

* **LangGraph:** Already embedded in the LangChain ecosystem, LangGraph was a logical extension.
* **AzureOpenAI:** Whi
le I started with OpenAI, I found Azure to be more cost-effective, though it required more manual setup.
* **Spoonacular
 API:** A free, albeit limited, recipe API.
* Streamlit **UI:** Chosen for its speed and ease in creating a user interfa
ce.

  
  
I'm too lazy to rewrite the article for reddit, but here's a link to the post on LinkedIn. I think its still 
readable even if you don't have LinkedIn but let me know if its not.

 Also welcome all feedback I'm learning and growin
g, as we all are!

```

I've been thinking about the use of context compression in retrieval systems. Why would anyone prefer compressing conte
xt (potentially losing information) instead of just using smaller, more granular chunks of data? In theory, breaking inf
ormation into smaller pieces should help maintain fidelity and accuracy, right?

Hey, I‚Äôm working on a platform where users can connect their Ads accounts, allowing us to retrieve and store their ad da
ta. Users can then interact with a chatbot to ask questions like 'How did my ads perform last week?' or 'What can I do t
o improve performance?' The chatbot provides answers based on the available data context.

Currently, I‚Äôm using a RAG ap
proach, where I chunk the data, store it in a vector database, and use LangChain to create the pipeline with a prompt te
mplate. However, I‚Äôm running into issues where the chatbot sometimes generates incorrect responses, and I‚Äôm also encount
ering token limit errors.

I‚Äôm looking for alternative methods to address these problems and would really appreciate you
r insights and feedback on this.

Hello everyone,

Just finished a post on how to create a simple Agentic RAG that choose which vector stores to use. This
 is actually a good introduction to LangGraph.

Here's the link:  [link](https://www.metadocs.co/2024/08/20/simple-agent

```
I'd like to gather some data from the user input, let's say, height, weight and age.

I'm able to do that using:  
Where
 UserData is a pydantic class



    runnable = prompt | llm.with_structured_output(schema=UserData)
    result_data = r
unnable.invoke('I am 165 cm tall')



From there I can get: `height=165`

How can I add a function/tool call to the mix 
to check if I have 3 props? (height, weight and age)

The idea is for the user to chat with the bot in a 'normal' conver
sation, and whenever it flags the 3 props are gathered, it can return a calculation. On each interaction, it checks if a
ny prop is in the message; if so, adds it to the Class until it has all 3.

```
Greetings,

I am attempting to follow this guide on creating a conversational Langchain agent.  
[https://python.langcha
in.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/qa\_chat\_history/](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history/)

Previ
ously, my app was using the chains outlined in that guide.

  
I want to create an agent executor with the retriever as 
a tool. However, I want the agent to cite its sources from the retrieved documents.

I am struggling to implement the fu
nction-calling code to create citations with the langchain agent. This is because my program uses the llm.with\_structur
ed\_output() tool calling model. outlined in the documentation below.  
[https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how\_to/
qa\_citations/](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/qa_citations/)

I am also using the following chains.

`de
f format_docs_with_id(docs: List[Document]) -> str:`  
`formatted = [`  
`f'Source ID: {i}\nArticle Title: {doc.metadata
['title']}\nArticle Snippet: {doc.page_content}'`  
`for i, doc in enumerate(docs)`  
`]`  
`return '\n\n' + '\n\n'.join
(formatted)`

`rag_chain_from_docs = (`  
`RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=(lambda x: format_docs_with_id(x['context'
])))`  
`| prompt`  
`| structured_llm`  
`)`

`retrieve_docs = (lambda x: x['input']) | retriever`

`chain = RunnablePa
ssthrough.assign(context=retrieve_docs).assign(`  
`answer=rag_chain_from_docs`  
`)`

As far as I understand it, it is 
not possible to use the with structured output and the above LLM chains with langchain agents.

Does anyone know how to 
integrate citations with a retriver-tool-wielding langchain agent?

I built a create\_tool\_calling\_agent that has the get\_income\_statement tool, which takes in company
 ticker,start\_date, end\_date and returns corresponding income statement data. when I asked 'What is apple's revenue in
 2022? ', the agent only returned me the data from the tools in JSON format instead of a text like' Apple's revenue in 2
022 is xxxx'.( see picture) what went wrong, why can't the agent observer the tool result and return me a text with the 
answer of my question in it. Seems like the observation->rethink part of an agent is missing here

My context is an excel sheet with 30k x 8 cells. I want the model to read a user entry and return a matched row from the
 context (it won't be a perfect match, I want the LLM to understand the user input and use its expertise to link the inp
ut to the most suitable match from the database). I'm more inclined towards RAG, but wanted to get some opinions. I've n
ever implemented RAG before - can I use the spreadsheet for embeddings? Or convert to JSON?

```
Hi all, I've been struggling with a problem and am looking for ideas on how to tackle it. The problem that I want to sol
ve is to verify that a given process (Document A) complies with given guidelines and regulations, provided in another do
cument (Document B).

Both documents can be quite large, so the text won‚Äôt fit into the context window of a single promp
t. My idea was to split both documents into chunks and compare these chunks with an LLM. I did the chunking process usin
g the StatisticalChunker from the semantic-chunkers package.

For example, document B has a section that covers laws abo
ut software documentation. Document A describes a software development process where one section outlines the procedure 
of how the documentation is done.

How can I best match these sections? Embedding both chunks and retrieving the top n s
imilar results won't always retrieve the correct corresponding chunks.

Is there a smart way of pre-processing the chunk
s? Maybe by utilizing one of Langchain's retrievers, such as the Parent Document Retriever?

Any thoughts or suggestions
 are welcome. Thanks!

Hi, I have a chatbot that consists of a basic graph where I have a node that calls that LLM and another node that execut
es the tools.  
But I need the user to authorize the execution of the tool first. For this, I need to show the user the 
tool that is about to execute and its arguments, the user can then read what the agent is about to do and could change t
he tool or one of the args by giving feedback. However, all of the information that is shown so that the user can accept
 it needs to be in a user-friendly way. Does anyone know how to do this?

Hello everyone,

I am a recent graduate joining in the pool of full time job seekers.

Background: I am 26 years old, in

took up courses and projects in the ML and AI domain. My thesis is in Computer Vision, nothing ground-breaking, but a go
od project using Segmentation.

My 'Data Scientist' experience is a part time program in my university which collaborate
s with a large pharma industry, where I worked and gained a lot of knowledge/experience in the Data Science area.

I nee
d an opinion on my resume and the blunders it contains (if any), and the things that I can improve. I also hope I have s
howcased my skills and expeience in the best manner possible, despite coming from a mechanical background. If not, pleas
e let me know your thoughts.

Thanks for your time.

For my job, I write hundreds of proposals for government contracts. I want to use an OpenAI API to build a tool that loo

. For context, I have some basic python experience, but I am unsure of exactly how to go about this. Some forums that I 
read suggested that I use langchain to comb through super long text files. My long term goal is to build a simple GUI an

should I use? Thanks!

```
Hi, these are two questions bundled into one.  
I'm supposed to create an LLM that gives users suggestions on the projec
t they are working.  
I'm also supposed to add a feedback loop that can improve the model response over time.  
  
So I 
can't just change the LLM model iteratively because I will be using an LLM through api.  
I figured that I could change 
the data I passed to the llm as context through RAG.  
That's when GPT suggested using neo4j's GraphRAG as we can change
 the weights of the data connections and also trace the part of the data we find faulty easily.  
  
This is what it sai
d  
  
After the AI provides a suggestion, monitor its effectiveness. If users frequently make certain changes or follow
 specific advice, reinforce those connections in your system, making them more prominent in future predictions. This cou
ld involve revisiting and adjusting the strength of connections within your knowledge graph. Use RL algorithms like Q-le
arning or policy gradients to adjust the weights

  
I'm new to Graph databases and RL and I'm wondering how to proceed.
 If so can you please provide suggestions/resources on how to implement the two or any better alternative to this method
?

Hi,

I want to load my reranking models faster, e.g. with an API.

I am using HuggingfaceEmbeddings with:

I am also using a reranking model which I am loading like this: 

    from sentence_transforme
rs import CrossEncoder
    
    reranking_model = CrossEncoder('BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3', max_length=512, device='mps')

    
    query = 'Ich liebe Fu√üball'
    
    page_contents = [
        'Hallo wer bist du',
        'Fu√üball is so geil
 ey',
        'Fu√üball ist der coolste Sport',
        'Hamburg liegt in Deutschland',
        ]
    re_res = reranking_
model.rank(query=query, documents=page_contents, return_documents=True, top_k=2)
    #[{'corpus_id': 1, 'score': 0.89757
94, 'text': 'Fu√üball is so geil ey'},
     #{'corpus_id': 2, 'score': 0.2194788, 'text': 'Fu√üball ist der coolste Sport'
}]

This works fine on my Mac, however when loading it in a docker it takes ages to build as the 'mps' device is not ava
ilable. 

  
So is anyone aware of a Sentece Transformers Inference API like the HuggingfaceInferenceAPIEmbeddings? Or c
an I rerank the docs the HuggingfaceInferenceAPIEmbeddings class?

Hi everyone, I am working on a Code Assistant project. The goal is to create a code assistant specific to a library, for
 example Keras(Just an example). There are a lot of codes available online which I could use by scraping and using it as
 the training dataset. The problem arises with the different versions. With new versions, some functions deprecate. So o
ur current code assistants trained on old data, couldn't pick this up. I want to make a Code Assistant, which could lear
n from the documentations, function signatures and understand which version of library we're using. Ideally I want the C
ode Assistant to pickup the version of library in the environment, then write code based on it. 

For this, I am current
ly generating synthetic data by making a template functions and prompts and generate variations using a LLM. But this is
 not a good way, as I have to manually implement each function test case and it's prompt template. I am looking for a be
tter way to do this.

P.S. - Let's say if the library is Keras. If I were to make a CA which used Keras to make DL model
s, I would just scrape all the Keras code from the internet to train it. As you know, there is no backward compatibility
 between Keras 2 and 3. Let's say all the Keras code I had on the internet were in Keras 2 and I were to make Code Assis
tant (CA) which is supposed to write my DL models in Keras 3, if Keras 3 is installed in my environment, how would I do 
it?

1. The LLM was already trained on Keras 2. Even if I explicitly mention it to use documentation of Keras 3 using RA
G and prompt engineering, it will still use elements of Keras 2. Because it hasn't seen Keras 3 code.
2. Let's say, I ha
ve Keras 2 code written and I invoke the LLM but the version installed in the env is Keras 3, it should translate the co
de from Keras 2 to Keras 3. How would it do that?

 a single request but the processing for subsequent requests is very slow, every time a query is validated the models ar

I'll go first.

* chunk size & overlap = 2000 & 200 using Recursive Text Splitter

Obviously, these are just a few of the many parameter

I am currently trying to build a chatbot that could generate test cases for products. my idea now is to feed it some man
-made test cases and product spec for certain devices and ask the LLM to reference them and generate test cases for some
 other devices. 

I have fed some Json structured test cases (as it is originally table formatted) and the product spec 
(in pure text format). At first, if there's only Json data in the vectorstore, the retrieved data is pretty accurate. Ho
wever, after adding the text data as well, it tends to retrieve more text data than json data, even when I am being quit
e specific (for example, if I ask it to give me some cases under certain class, then it might retrieve text for some rea
son, but if be super specific and tell it to search for json data, then it will look for json data.)

I am using FAISS a
s my vectorstore and I did not use any text splitter for json data (as I want to maintain the format). I am quite new to
 the field so any suggestions on how to improve this will be appreciated!

```
Hi all, I'm working on a side project that helps with sports analysis for historical games, which in turn will help with
 sports betting. Currently I've been only focused on MLB because I wanted to see how the use case would pan out.

My fir
st attempt at this was to use the openai endpoint and load all the relevant JSON objects and send a prompt along with th
em to GPT and see what I get back. Eventually, the context size was getting way too big and the problem I was running in
to was that it was expensive. Although, the prompts back were actually pretty decent and relevant to the data.

My secon
d attempt was to setup a RAG using Chroma/LangChain/GPT4o. I got it to work but the answers all seem very off and super 
vague. None of the data I have was shown in any of the prompts i asked, or any of the players that were playing in a gam
e were mentioned at all in the prompt back, plus it kept mentioning wrong games/teams whe asking it specific games. I‚Äôm 
assuming I might need to adjust the vector store a bit but not sure how I can do that with chroma.

My question is what 
might be the best way to setup some sort of process? My end result, I would like a response back using the historical da
ta I've provided to make assumptions on what a game could be like based off all the stats given, with some room for GPT 
to also make some inference as well.

I am a super new at this so it's been a learning process so far; please bear with 
me.

TL;DR: RAG overcomes the limitations of LLMs by bringing in external sources of information as relevant context.  
  

At the end of the step-by-step tutorial, you will be able to give your favorite LLM (ChatGPT, LLAMA 3, Mixtral, Gemini, 
Claude, etc.) some documents, ask it a question and see it respond based on relevant context.  
  
This will be running 
locally, using open-source libraries. Zero API and tooling costs.

deeplearning -  [ Need help with creating CLI for 'non-programmers' (LLMs) ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1elrfgm/need_help_with_creating_cli_for_nonprogrammers/) , 2024-08-21-0911
```
***TL;DR*** What is the best way to convert user input into sequence of commands and their corresponding parameters? Lik
e, imagine you are not a programmer and there is a console app with a CLI, but, well, you don't know the structure and t
he syntax of commands. And you don't want to know. YBut! You have a locally running instance of llama3.1 -- or whatever 
open LLM is out there now -- and you can ask it to create a CLI command for you. What would you do to accomplish that?


**Intro**

A little bit of context. I'm working on a project that targets scientists as end users. It has some UI using 
which it's possible to do all sort of things the lab workers would like to do. But recently the projects product owner d
ecided that it would be cool to have a small chat window that is accessable basically everywhere throughout the applicat
ion UI in which 'lives' a bot that can accept some input from a user and do what is requested. The pool of commands is f
inite and predefined.

**The issue**

So, putting details aside, the main issue to be solved is parsing user input (unst
ructured and possible incomplete data) to some structured form. In general, each and every user input should be transfor
med into a data structure that represents a sequence of commands with their parameters, for example:

User input: Please
, create X with param1 set to value1 and param2 equal to value2

Desired output:

    create_x --param1 value1 --param2 
value2

In this example, there is only one command, but in real life the request can represent a sequence of N commands,
 and they may depend on each other (sequence of execution does matter)

**What I've tried so far**

I have an 'experimen
t' environment: a python project with `ollama` and `langchain` installed. The main model I test is llama3.1-instruct wit
h 5bit quantization. (I'm sort of limited with hardware resourses, so XXB parameter models do not fit).

Up until now, I
've tried to achieve what I want with prompting in different forms, but in general I do the following:

1. As the very f
irst message in the chat, I create a 'system' one which explain what commands are there. The format is the following (I 
replaced original data not to expose the context more, so it's very generic): 

```xml
<scope>
    <models>
        <mod
el name='entityA'>
            <field name='uniqueId' type='string' description='unique identifier for entityA'/>
      
      <field name='label' type='string' description='label for entityA'/>
            <field name='category' type='enum'
 possible-value='alpha, beta, gamma, delta'/>
        </model>
        <model name='entityB'>
            <field name='u
niqueId' description='unique identifier for entityB'/>
            <field name='entityAIds' type='array' description='id
entifiers of entityAs associated with this entityB'/>
        </model>
    </models>
    <commands>
        <command nam
e='create_entityA' description='creates an instance of entityA'>
            <param name='uniqueId' type='string' descri
ption='unique identifier for entityA'/>
            <param name='label' type='string' description='label for entityA' re
quired='true'/>
            <param name='category' type='enum' possible-values='alpha, beta, gamma, delta'
             
      description='category of entityA (one value from the possible values list)' required='true'/>
        </command>
 
       <command name='remove_entityA' description='removes an instance of entityA by its unique identifier'>
           
 <param name='uniqueId' description='unique identifier of the entityA to be removed'
                   required='true'/
>
        </command>
        <command name='create_entityB'>
            <param name='label' description='label for enti
tyB'/>
        </command>
        <command name='link_entityAs_to_entityB'
                 description='associates inst
ances of entityA with a specific entityB based on the provided unique identifier of entityB'>
            <param name='u
niqueId' description='unique identifier of the entityB to which entityAs should be associated'
                   requir
ed='true'/>
            <param name='entityAIds'
                   description='an array of unique identifiers of entit
yAs to associate with the entityB'
                   type='array'
                   required='true'/>
        </comman
d>
        <command name='navigate' description='indicates that a user wants to go to a specific section of the platform
'>
            <param name='section' possible-values='entitiesA, entitiesB, configuration' required='true'/>
        </c
ommand>
        <command name='support' description='should be executed when a user seeks assistance on available functi
ons'/>
    </commands>
</scope>
```

So, now the model is provided with some context. Then, also in the 'system' message
 I:

* 'tell' the model that user input should be converted into a sequence of commands along with the corresponding par
ameters, all of this is described in the XML above
* describe the desired output format
* try to enforce some restrictio
n and cover edge cases

**The question part**

*Is this approach* ***viable***\*?\*

If yes, maybe there are some ***way
s to improve it***?

If not, *what would be* ***the alternative***?

So far I don't see how to apply fine tuning here

T
hank you in advance!
