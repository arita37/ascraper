```
Has anyone run across or conducted their own study of how the size of the files and datastorage increase with the number
 of document chunks that are loaded into the database? Is it quadratic, sub-linear, etc?

Also how sensitive is the size
 the choice of embeddings? If you use the \`text-embedding-ada-002\` with 1500 dimensions compared with another model wi
th only 300, will the database size go up linearly (approximately 5x larger)?

We've started exploring this idea, but I 
wanted to if anyone has dug into it already.

Greetings to the community,

My first post here. Apologies in advance for any possible violation of community's establis
hed principles and practices üôè

In the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter class, I'm not clear about the difference between 
the two methods: **create\_documents** vs **split\_documents**.

Suppose I've a given text, in any form, whether split/u
n-split in NLP sentences. It could be from multiple documents (PDF/text).

Which method I should choose to split the tex
t, and why?

For example, in Section 3 of *Ingest chat embedding* given here [https://python.langchain.com/docs/use\_cas
es/question\_answering/integrations/semantic-search-over-chat](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answ
ering/integrations/semantic-search-over-chat), first split\_text is used (with CharacterTextSplitter), and then create\_
documents (with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter). Why not directly use **split\_documents** on the initial text?

```
Hi,

I'm a software / solution architect, in eCommerce. I'm a competent developer and system architect, but new to LLMs,
 or even training a chatbot. I've built a very basic chatbot on node/react, using the OpenAI API. However, from this I l
earned two things, because of the size and complexity of the data I want to train the LLM on, I will need something more
 structured like LangChain. And, because of the nature of the tool I'd like to build, I'm not sure the OpenAI fee struct
ure will be financially viable.

This utility / search tool will be useful to the service departments of auto dealership
s, and just general service shops.

I expect they will value its utility at somewhere between $499, and $999 per year. T
hey won't want to pay an extreme amount for this, but they will pay for it. And there are 1000s of shops for whom it wou
ld save time for their employees, and be of use.

There might be 100 searches per day on it, from each paid user, and wi
th OpenAIs model, based on really limited experience, and sort of a gut feeling from my testing.... I think that would m
ean low, or negative margins, if relying on OpenAI / ChatGPT.

My expectation, and hope, is instead to build an applicat
ion that runs entirely locally, using llama.cpp, and run this utility on a single server.

I am looking for someone with
 technical understanding of using llama.cpp with LangChain, who has trained a LLM against a large and complex database, 
who might be interested in working on this project with me as a consultant.

Thanks

I am working on RAG using vector database. I'm in initial POC period and am using Chroma database and soon might migrate
 to Qdrant or weaviate.

That's not the topic, my main point is around chunking
I am of the opinion that chunking (text 
splitting) is extremely important as the semantic of the embedding will be determined by it. While it is my understandin
g that embedding is bit of a black box, my current sense is saying that I need to contextualize my chunk than doing a bl
ind split of 256 or 512 or 1024.

I have a bunch of word documents which I'm loading and have headings, sub headings and
 paragraphs. Sometimes the paragraphs can be a table in the word document too.

So 2 questions really:
1) Is splitting a
s important as I feel it is? 
2) What is a good document loader for word which can determine and preserve the tags of he
adings, subheadings, paragraphs and tables in a good structure so I can chunk it as desired.

```
I'm building a RAG chatbot for IT support. It ingests KB articles (chunked), retrieves them based on the query and then 
runs the 'classic' prompt that instructs the LLM to answer only using the source material from the retriever.  So far so
 good and the results were good in a pre-testing phase.  
Then I started testing with real-world questions and I stumble
d into an interesting case:  
\- the user types a message about not being to get into Microsoft Project.  
\- the retrie
ver retrieves an article about troubleshooting not being able to use Outlook.   
\- the LLM uses the chunk, copies the t
ext almost as is and substitutes the text 'Outlook' with 'Project' going as far as changing the name of the outlook exec
utable into the supposed project executable (winproj.exe) in a procedure. Of course the answer is wrong but I cannot get
 the LLM to simply say 'I do not know'.  
The LLM used is GPT-3.5 16k, latest version from Azure Open AI.  
I talked wit
h other people developing RAG chatbots and nobody saw something like that (but they are using other non-GPT models like 
Claude and llama).

```
Being a solopreneur has its fair share of challenges. Currently I've got businesses in ecommerce, agency work, and affil
iate marketing, and one undeniable truth remains: to truly scale by yourself, you need more than just sheer will. That's
 where I feel technology, especially AI, steps in.

As such, I wanted some AI tools that have genuinely made a differenc
e in my own work as a solo business operator. No fluff, just tried-and-true tools and platforms that have worked for me.
 The ability for me to scale alone with AI tools that take advantage of GPT in one way, or another has been significant 
and really changed my game over the past year. They bring in an element of adaptability and intelligence and work right 
alongside ‚Äútraditional automation‚Äù. Whether you're new to this or looking to optimize your current setup, I hope this po
st helps. FYI I used multiple prompts with GPT-4 to draft this using my personal notes.

# Plus AI (add-on for google sl
ides/docs)

I handle a lot of sales calls and demos for my AI automation agency. As I‚Äôm providing a custom service rathe
r than a product, every client has different pain points and as such I need to make a new slide deck each time. And maki
ng slides used to be a huge PITA and pretty much the bane of my existence until slide deck generators using GPT came out
. My favorite so far has been PlusAI, which works as a plugin for Google Slides. You pretty much give it a rough idea, o
r some key points and it creates some slides right within Google Slides. For me, I‚Äôve been pasting the website copy or a
ny information on my client, then telling PlusAI the service I want to propose. After the slides are made, you have a lo
t of leeway to edit the slides again with AI, compared to other slide generators out there. With 'Remix', I can switch u
p layouts if something feels off, and 'Rewrite' is there to gently nudge the AI in a different direction if I ever need 
it to. It's definitely given me a bit of breathing space in a schedule that often feels suffocating.

## echo.win (web-b
ased app)

As a solopreneur, I'm constantly juggling roles. Managing incoming calls can be particularly challenging. Ech
o.win, a modern call management platform, has become a game-changer for my business. It's like having a 24/7 personal as
sistant. Its advanced AI understands and responds to queries in a remarkably human way, freeing up my time. A standout f
eature is the Scenario Builder, allowing me to create personalized conversation flows. Live transcripts and in-depth ana
lytics help me make data-driven decisions. The platform is scalable, handling multiple simultaneous calls and improving 
customer satisfaction. Automatic contact updates ensure I never miss an important call. Echo.win's pricing is reasonable
, offering a personalized business number, AI agents, unlimited scenarios, live transcripts, and 100 answered call minut
es per month. Extra minutes are available at a nominal cost. Echo.win has revolutionized my call management. It's a comp
rehensive, no-code platform that ensures my customers are always heard and never missed

# MindStudio by YouAi (web app/
GUI)

I work with numerous clients in my AI agency, and a recurring task is creating chatbots and demo apps tailored to 
their specific needs and connected to their knowledge base/data sources. Typically, I would make production builds from 
scratch with libraries such as LangChain/LlamaIndex, however it‚Äôs quite cumbersome to do this for free demos. As each cl
ient has unique requirements, it means I'm often creating something from scratch. For this, I‚Äôve been using MindStudio (
by YouAi) to quickly come up with the first iteration of my app. It supports multiple AI models (GPT, Claude, Llama), le
t‚Äôs you upload custom data sources via multiple formats (PDF, CSV, Excel, TXT, Docx, and HTML), allows for custom flows 
and rules, and lets you to quickly publish your apps. If you are in their developer program, YouAi has built-in payment 
infrastructure to charge your users for using your app.

Unlike many of the other AI builders I‚Äôve tried, MindStudio bas
ically lets me dictate every step of the AI interaction at a high level, while at the same time simplifying the behind-t
he-scenes work. Just like how you'd sketch an outline or jot down main points, you start with a scaffold or decide to 'r
emix' an existing AI, and it will open up the IDE. I often find myself importing client data or specific project details
, and then laying out the kind of app or chatbot I'm looking to prototype. And once you've got your prototype you can cu
stomize the app as much as you want.

## LLamaIndex (Python framework)

As mentioned before, in my AI agency, I frequent
ly create chatbots and apps for clients, tailored to their specific needs and connected to their data sources. LlamaInde
x, a data framework for LLM applications, has been a game-changer in this process. It allows me to ingest, structure, an
d access private or domain-specific data.

The major difference over LangChain is I feel like LlamaIndex does high level
 abstraction much better.. Where LangChain unnecessarily abstracts the simplest logic, LlamaIndex actually has clear ben
efits when it comes to integrating your data with LLMs- it comes with data connectors that ingest data from various sour
ces and formats, data indexes that structure data for easy consumption by LLMs, and engines that provide natural languag
e access to data. It also includes data agents, LLM-powered knowledge workers augmented by tools, and application integr
ations that tie LlamaIndex back into the rest of the ecosystem. LlamaIndex is user-friendly, allowing beginners to use i
t with just five lines of code, while advanced users can customize and extend any module to fit their needs. To be compl
etely honest, to me it‚Äôs more than a tool- at its heart it‚Äôs a framework that ensures seamless integration of LLMs with 
data sources while allowing for complete flexibility compared to no-code tools.

## GoCharlie (web app)

GoCharlie, the 
first AI Agent product for content creation, has been a game-changer for my business. Powered by a proprietary LLM calle
d Charlie, it's capable of handling multi-input/multi-output tasks. GoCharlie's capabilities are vast, including content
 repurposing, image generation in 4K and 8K for various aspect ratios, SEO-optimized blog creation, fact-checking, web r
esearch, and stock photo and GIF pull-ins. It also offers audio transcriptions for uploaded audio/video files and YouTub
e URLs, web scraping capabilities, and translation.

One standout feature is its multiple input capability, where I can 
attach a file (like a brand brief from a client) and instruct it to create a social media campaign using brand guideline
s. It considers the file, prompt, and website, and produces multiple outputs for each channel, each of which can be edit
ed separately. Its multi-output feature allows me to write a prompt and receive a response, which can then be edited fur
ther using AI. Overall, very satisfied with GoCharlie and in my opinion it really presents itself as an effective altern
ative to GPT based tools.

# ProfilePro (chrome extension)

As someone overseeing multiple Google Business Profiles (GBP
s) for my various businesses, I‚Äôve been using ProfilePro by Merchynt. This tool stood out with its ability to auto-gener
ate SEO-optimized content like review responses and business updates based on minimal business input. It works as a Chro
me extension, and offers suggestions for responses automatically on your GBP, with multiple options for the tone it will
 write in. As a plus, it can generate AI images for Google posts, and offer suggestions for services and service/product
 descriptions. While it streamlines many GBP tasks, it still allows room for personal adjustments and refinements, offer
ing a balance between automation and individual touch. And if you are like me and don't have dedicated SEO experience, i
t can handle ongoing optimization tasks to help boost visibility and drive more customers to profiles through Google Map
s and Search

Hi all,

As the title indicates, I want to ask about the memory features in Langchain. I was talking to someone at work 
who raised some concerns about data security/privacy when dealing with the memory classes in Langchain. The main concern
 they have is about chat history getting stored in an external database during runtime.

My personal understanding based
 on documentation and also looking at the langchain repo is that the data is stored locally and there doesn't seem to be
 any indication of any interaction with external databases. If any of y'all have dealt with these kind of questions befo
re, how did you approach it? What steps or methods would you recommend to definitively address and alleviate these data 
storage concerns?

Thanks!

```
I'm learning LangChain and working on a project where I need to:

1. Extract data from a \~50 page PDF.
2. Display this 
data in structured tables.

For context, think of the PDF as a product catalog, with item names, descriptions, and price
s.

My first program uses PyPDF2 for PDF parsing and FAISS coupled with OpenAIEmbeddings for similarity-based querying. 
For instance:

    query = 'What is the price of the television set'
    docs = document_search.similarity_search(query)

    chain.run(input_documents=docs, question=query

This works well, but the result is plain-text and lacks structure. 
I've now shifted to learning structured output, creating a schema to define data representation.  My basic structure cou
ld be the item name, the item description, and the item cost.

Now, onto my main question: What's the most efficient app
roach for feeding PDF data into my structured output chain? Currently, I'm using broad queries like 'list all items with
 a price,' which tap into my initial vector-based similarity search framework. Is this approach more complicated than ne
cessary? Given that I've moved towards structured outputs and am essentially using 'catch-all' queries, the need for vec
tor-based querying seems redundant.  


\*Update - I did try just submitted the entire contents of the PDF, but its far 
larger than the token limit for most models I'm using; What's the best way to split up the document and submit for my st
ructured input, if not the vector/similarity search method?

Any tips or best practices are welcome!

Hey all, we just released our new project/paper and we thought you all might find it useful!

Our project (Kani) is a su
per lightweight and hackable alternative to frameworks like LangChain or simpleAIchat meant to help developers hook in c
allable functions or tools to chat models easily. With Kani, devs can write functions in pure python and just add one li
ne (the `@ai_function()` decorator) to turn any function into an AI-callable function!

Kani works with any model and ha
s built-in tools for OpenAI, HuggingFace, LLaMAv2, Vicuna, and GGML with more to come. Kani also never does any prompt e
ngineering under the hood and doesn't require learning complex library tools---all defaults are minimal and highly custo
mizable.

```
Hey Reddit,

I'm working on a tool to pull data from highly irregular Excel files. I've gotten reasonable results which 
is extremely fast with standard Python coding, but it's far from perfect due to the lack of standardized templates. 

In
terestingly, when I tested ChatGPT-4 on a sample table, it did a decent job at data extraction. However, relying solely 
on GPT-4 has its downsides like token limits and slow processing speed (and data privacy issues). Plus, splitting the Ex
cel sheet to fit within these limits results in loss of context and data.

I'm considering fine-tuning a language model 
to post-process data that was in a Pandas DataFrame (perhaps converted to JSON). Has anyone had success with this approa
ch or have alternative recommendations? I've tried Langchain, but it wasn't helpful.

I have figured out to extract the 
relevant columns, but the post-processing part is where I am considering using an LLM which understands the domain and w
hat needs to be extracted based on the examples I feed it.

Looking forward to your thoughts! And would be happy to answ
er any additional questions.

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Chains and Agents ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/16d7ee6/d_chains_and_agents/) , 2023-10-06-0909
```
I think there's a lot of confusion around AI agents today and it's mainly because of lack of definition and using the wr
ong terminology.

We've been talking to many companies who are claiming they're working on agents but when you look unde
r the hood, they are really just chains.

I just listened to the Latent Space pod with¬†Harrison Chase (Founder of Langch
ain) and I really liked how he thinks about chains vs agents.

Chains: sequence of tasks in a more rigid order, where yo
u have more control, more predictability.  
Agents: handling the edge-cases, the long-tail of things that can happen.

A
nd the most important thing is that it's not an OR question but an AND one: you can use them in the same application by 
starting with chains -> figuring our the edge-cases -> using agents to deal with them.

We're building a fast low latency Graph Database called FalkorDB that will also support Vector search.  
It's based on R
edis and can be used both as a stand alone database or a module for existing Redis.  
It feels like that is going to be 
the most optimized way to serve Knowledge as RAG, would love to get your feedback.  
[https://github.com/FalkorDB/falkor
db](https://github.com/FalkorDB/falkordb)  


It already supports LlamIndex and Langchain:

Hey everyone!

As you can guess from the title, this is the error I get. I only changed the model in AutoModelForCausalL
M, Older version was 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

`'''`

`model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-c
hat-hf',`

`device_map ='auto',`

`torch_dtype = torch.float16,`

`use_auth_token = True)`

`'''`

&#x200B;

However, si
nce my GPU is NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 TI, it answers a simple question in 20 mins. Then I changed it to: 

`model = Auto
ModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GGUF',`

`model_file = 'llama-2-7b-chat.q4_K_M.gguf',`

`devi
ce_map ='auto',`

`torch_dtype = torch.float16,`

`use_auth_token = True)`

&#x200B;

However, this is not working, and 
giving the error. Below is the full code, if it is needed to solve.

deeplearning -  [ How to find 'custom' datasets for LLM ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/16bj3hg/how_to_find_custom_datasets_for_llm/) , 2023-10-06-0909
```
Hey folks,

I've been digging everywhere, including here, for LLMs and custom applications. So, I read many things, lear
ned from ppl here. Its time to try something. I will try implement Llama v2 - Langchain - Chroma combination. But also I
 want to upload a dataset so that I can try my model on that. 

I find some datasets big enough (for now, 2-5 gb is ok) 
however they are table-style. I want something more texty, I mean I could use 'American Stories' or 'Arxiv' however I be
lieve that they are already used by Llama to train. 

&#x200B;

Is there any suggestions or sources that you can provide
 ? Thanks!
