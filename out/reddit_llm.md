Hello, 

For context, here's the structure of the documents in my collection:

ng the following code:

    const retriever = await vectorStore.asRetriever({

Hello, sorry for the title could not find anything better.

I'm a 'traditional' software engineer that has been asked fr
om the boss if I can develop the following application:

'we have A LOT (around half millinon) of PDF documents that are
 reports about the performance of a company. Each report is very long (around 100 pages of text) and is terminated by a 
couple of tables that summarize the same information for quick lookup. The reports are 'printed' from word documents, an
d the word document itself come from a dozen of templates (because the template changed with the passing of time) and th
ose coming from the same period differ between only for the few information (for example, the name of the company, the a
ddress, the number of employers etc.). Also most of the information would be easy accessible, if only the tables could b
e easy to read from a pdf. Lastly, the boss would like to chat with the document asking informations about it. But also 
wants to chat wit the dabase as a whole'

Some examples of queries:

'Who is the medic that works for the company X?' (e
ach company has one and only one medic associated with them)

'What are the companies served by a particular medic?'

'W
hat company has the property X?' (the properties are  described in the table with a checkbox

&#x200B;

Here it is the i
ntuition of the usefulness of a LLM chain: the request to 'chat' with the knoledge database

Here are my worries, though
:

* first question is the more easy in my opinion to go right because I could find the relative embedding and make chat
gpt or someone else reply just for that information on that single document. However, a question: should the chunk conta
in both the medic name and the company name (for the context), or just the medic? Because, as I said, The document is 10
0 pages long and the company name is cited ONLY in the first page. Easy to solve, but a question since I'm beginner
* Se
cond question: as I have understood, LLM can reply only to something they has Just seen, I mean that you have to present
 them with an embedding and they can answer only on that. Suppose that a medic is associated to 10000 companies (I doubt
, but it is just an example) as far as I know it cannot reply since most LLM can take up to 4k token as an input. Am I r
ight?
* 3rd question, as far as I have seen through experimentation, LLM have trouble reading on tables, whatever the fo
rmatting is. Am i right?

&#x200B;

All this concerns make me wonder if this problem should be approached from an algori
thmic perspective and a traditional (sql o nosql) database. Is that correct, or there is a margin of hybridations? May b
e should I try looking towards chain agents (just found them, might be the case)?I'm not looking about code, just some h
ints on what to do or not to do

thanks to everyone

Hey,

I'm wokring in a market intelligence function and I have a weekly need of providing 5-10 bullet point summaries of
 competitors news which they publish.

Idelly, I would be able to load a PDF to langchain and and the results which the 
LLM  gives would be following structure which I can define.

Issue in vectorstore approach is that it only selects x chu
nks which will be assessed/summarized, but I would like to take everything in scope (although it's costly but so is my t
ime üòÑ). For example in financial reports the relevant numbers might be very scattered within the document.

Any suggesti
on whether tejre would be better options than:
1) extract pdf to test eg pypdf
2) input text string as prompt input to t
he LLM and use a conversationalchain

Thanks a alot for your help!

I built a custom chatbot that can answer questions based on content from either youtube or a specific website.   


Both
 youtube and website content are stored in my local vectorstore via FAISS.

  
When a user asks a chatbot a question tha
t can be answered by the website, we want it to look there instead of youtube. And vice-versa. Right now, it's retrievin
g mostly from youtube because queries generally semantically match youtube content, even though a simple response can be
 found from the website.  


I was thinking I need to build an LLM-based classifier system or a Langchain function. This
 first step would have the LLM determine where to look. I haven't played around with functions - can a function be an LL
M call?

Greetings to the community,

My first post here. Apologies in advance for any possible violation of community's establis

In the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter class, I'm not clear about the difference between 
the two methods: **create\_documents** vs **split\_documents**.

Suppose I've a given text, in any form, whether split/u
n-split in NLP sentences. It could be from multiple documents (PDF/text).

Which method I should choose to split the tex
t, and why?

For example, in Section 3 of *Ingest chat embedding* given here [https://python.langchain.com/docs/use\_cas
es/question\_answering/integrations/semantic-search-over-chat](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answ
ering/integrations/semantic-search-over-chat), first split\_text is used (with CharacterTextSplitter), and then create\_
documents (with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter). Why not directly use **split\_documents** on the initial text?

Hi,

I'm a software / solution architect, in eCommerce. I'm a competent developer and system architect, but new to LLMs,
 or even training a chatbot. I've built a very basic chatbot on node/react, using the OpenAI API. However, from this I l
earned two things, because of the size and complexity of the data I want to train the LLM on, I will need something more
 structured like LangChain. And, because of the nature of the tool I'd like to build, I'm not sure the OpenAI fee struct
ure will be financially viable.

This utility / search tool will be useful to the service departments of auto dealership
s, and just general service shops.

I expect they will value its utility at somewhere between $499, and $999 per year. T
hey won't want to pay an extreme amount for this, but they will pay for it. And there are 1000s of shops for whom it wou
ld save time for their employees, and be of use.

There might be 100 searches per day on it, from each paid user, and wi
th OpenAIs model, based on really limited experience, and sort of a gut feeling from my testing.... I think that would m
ean low, or negative margins, if relying on OpenAI / ChatGPT.

My expectation, and hope, is instead to build an applicat
ion that runs entirely locally, using llama.cpp, and run this utility on a single server.

I am looking for someone with
 technical understanding of using llama.cpp with LangChain, who has trained a LLM against a large and complex database, 
who might be interested in working on this project with me as a consultant.

Thanks

I put together a LangChain agent which uses two tools- a retriever and a Pandas tool, and uses the ReAct framework to do
 the overall thinking. Although it theoretically works as it's expected, it takes too long of times to produce answers. 


What I observe is that it takes too long if time in the 'thinking' stage. Has anyone else experienced this?

More spec
ifically, I'm using the 'conversational-react-description' type agent.

Let me know what are the general steps that can 
be taken to optimize the time it takes for the agent to produce final answer

For eve

1. Break it down into embeddings and store it in a database temporarily(they are too la

2. Using openai api run two custom prompts against that specific pdfs data in the database  
3. Put the

```
I am working on RAG using vector database. I'm in initial POC period and am using Chroma database and soon might migrate
 to Qdrant or weaviate.

That's not the topic, my main point is around chunking
I am of the opinion that chunking (text 
splitting) is extremely important as the semantic of the embedding will be determined by it. While it is my understandin
g that embedding is bit of a black box, my current sense is saying that I need to contextualize my chunk than doing a bl
ind split of 256 or 512 or 1024.

I have a bunch of word documents which I'm loading and have headings, sub headings and
 paragraphs. Sometimes the paragraphs can be a table in the word document too.

So 2 questions really:
1) Is splitting a
s important as I feel it is? 
2) What is a good document loader for word which can determine and preserve the tags of he
adings, subheadings, paragraphs and tables in a good structure so I can chunk it as desired.

Thank you Redditors!!

```
I'm building a RAG chatbot for IT support. It ingests KB articles (chunked), retrieves them based on the query and then 
runs the 'classic' prompt that instructs the LLM to answer only using the source material from the retriever.  So far so
 good and the results were good in a pre-testing phase.  
Then I started testing with real-world questions and I stumble
d into an interesting case:  
\- the user types a message about not being to get into Microsoft Project.  
\- the retrie
ver retrieves an article about troubleshooting not being able to use Outlook.   
\- the LLM uses the chunk, copies the t
ext almost as is and substitutes the text 'Outlook' with 'Project' going as far as changing the name of the outlook exec
utable into the supposed project executable (winproj.exe) in a procedure. Of course the answer is wrong but I cannot get
 the LLM to simply say 'I do not know'.  
The LLM used is GPT-3.5 16k, latest version from Azure Open AI.  
I talked wit
h other people developing RAG chatbots and nobody saw something like that (but they are using other non-GPT models like 
Claude and llama).  


Any ideas? Did u see something like that happen? Did you find a solution?

Abstract:

>Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) enable research

vironments, humans, and other agents** using natural language interfaces. **We consider language agents as a promising d
irection towards artificial general intelligence** and release Agents, an **open-source library** with the goal of openi
ng up these advances to a wider non-specialist audience. Agents is carefully engineered to support important **features 
including planning, memory,  tool usage, multi-agent communication, and fine-grained symbolic  control.** Agents is **us
er-friendly** as it **enables non-specialists** to build, customize, test, tune, and deploy state-of-the-art **autonomou
s language agents without much coding**. The **library** is also **research-friendly as its modularized design** makes i
t **easily extensible for researchers.**

I'm currently working on a project to give a quick summary of long articles/conversations.

I'm running llama-2-7b-chat-

The method I'm using is map\_reduce (option 2)from thi

rization))

Of everything I've tried this is the only one that's been able to do decent summaries in a reasonable amount
 of time. However with really long articles (10,000+ words) it takes \~6 minutes before giving an output.

I tried runni
ng this same thing on a g5.12xlarge instance which has 4 A10G gpus but it hasn't reduced the time by any noticeable amou
nt.

Is there anything else I could be doing to speed this up?

Hey all, we just released our new project/paper and we thought you all might find it useful!

Our project (Kani) is a su
per lightweight and hackable alternative to frameworks like LangChain or simpleAIchat meant to help developers hook in c
allable functions or tools to chat models easily. With Kani, devs can write functions in pure python and just add one li
ne (the `@ai_function()` decorator) to turn any function into an AI-callable function!

Kani works with any model and ha
s built-in tools for OpenAI, HuggingFace, LLaMAv2, Vicuna, and GGML with more to come. Kani also never does any prompt e
ngineering under the hood and doesn't require learning complex library tools---all defaults are minimal and highly custo
mizable.

```
Hey Reddit,

I'm working on a tool to pull data from highly irregular Excel files. I've gotten reasonable results which 
is extremely fast with standard Python coding, but it's far from perfect due to the lack of standardized templates. 

In
terestingly, when I tested ChatGPT-4 on a sample table, it did a decent job at data extraction. However, relying solely 
on GPT-4 has its downsides like token limits and slow processing speed (and data privacy issues). Plus, splitting the Ex
cel sheet to fit within these limits results in loss of context and data.

I'm considering fine-tuning a language model 
to post-process data that was in a Pandas DataFrame (perhaps converted to JSON). Has anyone had success with this approa
ch or have alternative recommendations? I've tried Langchain, but it wasn't helpful.

I have figured out to extract the 
relevant columns, but the post-processing part is where I am considering using an LLM which understands the domain and w
hat needs to be extracted based on the examples I feed it.

Looking forward to your thoughts! And would be happy to answ
er any additional questions.

```
I think there's a lot of confusion around AI agents today and it's mainly because of lack of definition and using the wr
ong terminology.

We've been talking to many companies who are claiming they're working on agents but when you look unde
r the hood, they are really just chains.

I just listened to the Latent Space pod with¬†Harrison Chase (Founder of Langch
ain) and I really liked how he thinks about chains vs agents.

Chains: sequence of tasks in a more rigid order, where yo
u have more control, more predictability.  
Agents: handling the edge-cases, the long-tail of things that can happen.

A
nd the most important thing is that it's not an OR question but an AND one: you can use them in the same application by 
starting with chains -> figuring our the edge-cases -> using agents to deal with them.
