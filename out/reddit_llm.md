```
Hi! I built a new page to browse resources in the Langchain ecosystem -

[https://ecosystems.gitwallet.co/ecosystems/lan
gchain](https://ecosystems.gitwallet.co/ecosystems/langchain)

This is part of a bigger product called **Echo**, which i
s a new way to find projects, resources and people in open source ecosystems. You can think of this as a 'New Github Exp
lore', or a 'Product Hunt for Open Source', in a sense.

We also made a different take on the Github repo page to make i
t a bit more readable, see related repos, and a few more things. Here's an example for langchain4j:

[https://ecosystems
.gitwallet.co/ecosystems/langchain/projects/langchain4j](https://ecosystems.gitwallet.co/ecosystems/langchain/projects/l
angchain4j)

I'm still an agent n00b and really appreciate how langchain is creating all the 'right abstractions' to mak
e agent development easier. Anyways, would love to get some feedback from this community!

all -  [ Looking for local llm solution to continuously work on my codebase ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gjh2jb/looking_for_local_llm_solution_to_continuously/) , 2024-11-05-0912
```
Soon I will have access to hardware capable of running llms. My first goal is to set up something that could iteratively
 look at the code in my projects and improve them it, i.e. fix bugs, improve performance, write tests, simplify the code
, and enhance readability.

I imagine having some script that picks a random task, project, or file (I can think of task
s with single-file context and with the whole project context), does the work (ideally in many steps, like generating a 
solution, criticizing it, improving it, and repeating), prepares a merge request, and repeats this process endlessly.

C
ould you advise me on what tools and models would be best to achieve this goal? Does my approach make sense? Are there a
ny ready-made solutions I could use?

Honestly speaking I'm a bit lost. I read a lot about ollama (I already tried it), 
llama.cpp, mistral.rs, autogpt, langchain and others, I'm not even sure if I'm looking at tools suitable for my usecase.


As far as I understand, I could use one of {ollama, llama.cpp, mistral.rs} to run local AI server and then use it in A
utoGPT or LangChain? But then, how do I feed it with my project knowledge? 


----------------------------------------
E
DIT:

Perhaps I wasn't clear at start. What I want to achieve right now is to automate in the smartest possible way, e.g
. not re-inventing the wheel, what I've been doing since GPT4 release, e.g.

1. pick random file
2. use template like 's
implify the code in the following snippet: {pasted file}. Output only patch file applicable with `git apply`'
3. run git
 apply, build code, run tests, gather the output
4. if not working, gather the output, paste into template like 'it didn
't work. This is the output: {...}. Try again.'; go to 3
5. optionally: run the improvement loop (paste the ouput into a
 template like 'The solution works. Do you think it can be simplified further?'. If yes, go to 3
6. git commit, git chec
kout -b new_branch, git push
7. report merge request
8. git checkout master
9. go to 1

This all worked let's say 3 out 
of 5 times with GPT4 and manual operator, e.g. me manuvering between the chatgpt browser tab, text editor and terminal.


Since then, I get _way_ more sophisticated help from Copilot, OAI released o1-mini, there is mistral large, new claude,
 agents and I don't know, what else. Intuition tells me, this topic is already deeply researched and I would like to fin
d out where to start in late 2024.

I don't expect it develops full features that require deep understanding of the whol
e code base. I also don't expect it to be turbofast. I'm fine if it prepares 10 merge request over full weekend and I ac
cept just 1, because 9 are hallucinations.

Hey Folks,

I am planning to deploy a RAG Conversational bot that acts as a QA bot for a given text. 

While it was easy
 to develop the prototype in the notebook, I cant find substantial resources that would help me build the application in
 production. So I am turning to the community for helps and pointers :) .

Right now, I am using ChromaDB as vector stor

```
Building LLM applications has been quite painful for me. Most frameworks seem to introduce unnecessary abstractions that
 makes everything opaque. When using langchain, etc, one doesnt know whats going behind the curtains, which API calls ar
e being made - as a result the easiest way to  build anything is to go from scratch most of the time. 

  
I created [Ge
nSphere](https://github.com/octopus2023-inc/gensphere), an open-source framework to build LLM applications in a declarat
ive way, with YAML files, that  define an execution graph. Nodes can be either LLM API calls, regular function execution
s or other graphs themselves. Because you can nest graphs easily, building complex applications is not an issue, but at 
the same time you don't lose control.

  
There is also this Hub that you can push and pull projects from, so it becomes
 easy to share what you build and leverage from the community.

Its all open-source. Would love to get your thoughts. Pl
s reach out or join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/DZFWMXJv) if you want to contribute.

```
I've been building LLM-based applications, and was super frustated with all major frameworks - langchain, autogen, crewA
I, etc. They also seem to introduce a pile of unnecessary abstractions. It becomes super hard to understand what's going
 behind the curtains even for very simple stuff.

So I just published this open-source framework [GenSphere](https://git
hub.com/octopus2023-inc/gensphere)**.** You build LLM applications with yaml files, that define an execution graph. Node
s can be either LLM API calls, regular function executions or other graphs themselves. Because you can nest graphs easil
y, building complex applications is not an issue, but at the same time you don't lose control.

You basically code in ya
ml, stating what are the tasks that need to be done and how they connect. Other than that, you only write individual pyt
hon functions to be called during the execution. No new classes and abstractions to learn.

Its all open-source. Would l
ove to get your thoughts. Pls reach out  if you want to contribute, there are tons of things to do!

I am not sure how to write the stream function when I have written the call fuction for my LLM class like shwon below. C
an someone help me with the code for the custom LLM stream function?

I read about creating custom LLM topic on reddit a
nd have implemented code in this link:

https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/17v1rhv/integrating_llm_rest_api_int
o_a_langchain/

Other similar post: https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/17v1rhv/integrating_llm_rest_api_into_a_
langchain/

Langchain documentation gives a really dumb example of streaming characters in the input prompt which is not
 very helpful.
https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/custom_llm/

I am trying to send a request via an API request to
 my LLM using requests.post, and I want the response to be streamed by the stream method.

```
Hi,

I m thinking about an application like this:  
  
1) I have prompt composed by text and image. The text is fixed bu
t fairly long, something along the line  'Describe what is in the image ...' while the image  changes as the user upload
s it  
2) I have a like 10K words long text for many of the images that the user might upload  
3) to improve the applic
ation I would like to do RAG as follows:  
3.1) create embeddings for all the texts by chunking - say - 1500 words  
3.2
) create embeddings for the images  
3.3) when the user uploads the image, create the embedding and search the text that
 are more close to the image embedding  
3.4) Include the retrieved text into the prompt and send it to an Multimodal LL
M

  
I see there are sever API that to the multimodal embeddings (text and image in the same vector space)  for example
 embed 3, google, but they all limit the text to 30 or 70 words, while I have texts of 10k words or chunks of 1500 words
 -70 words would not improve the prompt

I'm not sure what to do?  
Should I chunk the 10K texts into 50 words chunks, s
elect say 100 embeddings and concat the text? Sounds wrong?

Any idea?

```
I have raised a question on the repo: [https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraphjs/discussions/655](https://github.com/l
angchain-ai/langgraphjs/discussions/655)

In summary, I want to programmatically, create a feedback on a LangSmith trace
 either through a tool or node. I figured the right place for it is a node since you can pass the Runnable Config and th
eoretically get the \`runId\` from it to be used in the \`langsmithClient.createFeedback\` function. I have attempted a 
few different ways to retrieve the runId and also manually setting it in the configurable object, but none seem to work.
 Has anyone been able to successfully do this within a graph node? (note my application is in ts. and I am using the lan
graph.js SDK)

 🔍 Built a GitHub Repository AI Assistant using LangChain + Gemini

Hey r/LangChain! I wanted to share a project I've bu
ilt that helps developers understand any GitHub repository through natural language Q&A.

🔹What it does:
- Accepts any G
itHub repo URL
- Lets you ask questions about the codebase in plain English
- Provides quick explanations of code struct
ure & documentation
- Supports multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.)

🔹Tech Stack:
- Lan
gChain for Agent system 
- Google's Gemini as llm
- Hugging Face for embedding models
- Advanced RAG implementation for 
accurate responses

The tool aims to solve the common challenge of quickly understanding unfamiliar codebases.

 🔹You ca
n try it here: https://git-ai-by-jay.streamlit.app

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback from the LangChain commu
nity! What features would you like to see added?

Let me know if you'd like me to modify anything in this Reddit post!

```
When a user uploads a doc, it chunks, embeds, then persists it. This currently takes 25 seconds with multithreading on 6
 cores for me. I need this to be faster, and I need to add support for concurrent file uploads.

Here's my current setup
:

embeddings: openai small embedding model (batch embed)

chunking: langchain recursive text chunker (250 chunk size)


persistence: Mongodb vector store (batch persist)   
  
I see several companies online seemingly able to upload & embed 
my same 200 page document in 6 seconds (chatgpt), and in parallel so i'm wondering if i'm missing something that everyon
e else is using. What tools libraries/tools do you guys use to have fast chunking, embedding, & persistence?

My current
 idea is to achieve fast parallel uploads via a separate AWS lambda invocation per upload, and have a high amount of cor
es per lambda so we can achieve paralell processing of chunks in the lambda. Thoughts/advice?

all -  [ Introducing Cascade of Semantically Integrated Layers (CaSIL): An Absurdly Over-Engineered Thought/R ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gi102k/introducing_cascade_of_semantically_integrated/) , 2024-11-05-0912
```
So here’s a fun one. Imagine layering so much semantic analysis onto a single question that it practically gets therapy.
 That’s CaSIL – Cascade of Semantically Integrated Layers. It’s a ridiculous (but actually effective) pure Python algori
thm designed to take any user input, break it down across multiple layers, and rebuild it into a nuanced response that e
ven makes sense to a human.

I have been interested in and experimenting with all the reasoning/agent approaches lately 
which got me thinking of how I could add my 2 cents of ideas, mainly around the concept of layers that waterfall into ea
ch other and the extracted relationships of the input.

The whole thing operates without any agent frameworks like LangC
hain or CrewAI—just straight-up Python and math. And the best part? CaSIL can handle any LLM, transforming it from a “ye
s/no” bot to something that digs deep, makes connections, and understands broader context.

How it works (briefly):

1. 
Initial Understanding: Extract basic concepts from the input.


2. Relationship Analysis: Find and connect related conce
pts (because why not build a tiny knowledge graph along the way).


3. Context Integration: Add historical and contextua
l knowledge to give that extra layer of depth.


4. Response Synthesis: Put it all together into a response that doesn’t
 feel like a Google result from 2004.


The crazy part? It actually works. Check out the pure algo implementation with t
he repo. No fancy dependencies,, and it’s easy to integrate with whatever LLM you’re using.

https://github.com/severian
42/Cascade-of-Semantically-Integrated-Layers

Example output: https://github.com/severian42/Cascade-of-Semantically-Inte
grated-Layers/blob/main/examples.md


EDIT FOR CLARITY!!! 

Sorry everyone, I posted this and then fell asleep after a l
ong week of work. I'll clarify some things from the comments here.

1. What is this? What are you claiming?: This is jus
t an experiment that actually worked and is interesting to use. I by no means am saying I have the 'secret sauce' or riv
als o1. My algorithm is just a really interesting way of having LLM s 'think' through stuff in a non-traditional way. Be
nchmarks so far have been hit or miss

2. Does it work? Is the code crap?: it does work! And yes, the code is ugly. I cr
eated this in 2 days with the help of Claude while working my day job.
 

3. No paper? Fake paper?: There is no official
 paper but there is the random one in the repo. What is that? Well, part of my new workflow I was testing that helped st
art this codebase. Part of this project was to eventually showcase how I built an agent based workflow that allows me to
 take an idea, have a semi-decent/random 'research' paper written by those agents. I then take that and run it into anot
her agent team that translates it into a starting code base for me to see if I can actually get working. This one did.



4. Examples?: There is an example in the repo but I will try and put together some more definitive and useful. For now,
 take a look at the repo and give it a shot. Easy set up for the most part. Will make a UI also for those non coders 



Sorry if it seemed like I was trying to make great claims. Not at all, just showing some interesting new algorithms for 
LLM inference

Hello everyone, I'm pretty new to langchain & langraph assuming that I want to build pizza ordering bot which would talk
 to the customers, sample bellow: 

**Bot** : Hi, how can I help you ?  
**Human**: I would like to buy a pepperoni  
**
Bot:** Sure something else ?   
**Human:** I would like to ask is diavola spicy ?  
**Bot:** Yes, the diavola is spicy  
?   
**Human**: Okay, I would like one diavola as well with some extra basil .  
**Bot :** <conclude the order and confi
rm it> 

I'm trying to achieve something similar in a more complex context, but the problem I face cannot keep a consist
ent context, e.g. It could add diavola with details but remove pepperoni, or keep diavola without extra details. 

  
I 
would like to ask if someone faced something similar, how do you handle this problem, maybe there is some useful tools w
hich, I'm not aware of ? 

Thanks

**Has anyone else been frustated writing and debugging langchain code?** There are so many classes and abstractions that
 don't seem to add much value. As a result, what really happens behind the curtains feel quite opaque. For me having low
-level control is very important. 

So I just published this open-source framework [**GenSphere**](https://github.com/oc
topus2023-inc/gensphere)**.** You build LLM applications with yaml files, that define an execution graph. Nodes can be e
ither LLM API calls, regular function executions or other graphs themselves. Because you can nest graphs easily, buildin
g complex applications is not an issue, but at the same time you don't lose control. 

There is also this Hub that you c
an push and pull projects from, so it becomes easy to share what you build and leverage from the community.

```
Has anyone experimented with creating a planner agent that dynamically creates graphs to carry out complex tasks?  
I've
 built an agentic framework from scratch where each agents each hold specific personas and sets of tools and collaborate
 in a centralized conversation with the user.  
Each message received by an agent triggers an sort of 'internal monologu
e' which implements the ReAct framework.

But I've noticed that without clear directions, planning, and tasks assignment
s, the agent team really struggles to carry out complex tasks.

So I was thinking: it'd be great to implement a sort of 
plan-execute pattern with a planning agent. Ideally it would even create a LangGraph Graph.  
Models would even be train
ed on planning, kind of like how o1-preview has been trained on chain of thoughts.

Any thoughts? Anyone has experimente
d with this?  
Cheers!

all -  [ Autogen needs improvement. How no one felt the need for call back function ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1ghcvi5/autogen_needs_improvement_how_no_one_felt_the/) , 2024-11-05-0912
```
I know this is langchain subreddit but thought to discuss here as most agent developers are there..

I have been playing
 with autogen for few hours to understand.
I immediately felt two needs,
Suppose there are two agents, writer and review
er. 
The termination condition is when reviewer gives it rating of 8 or more.
My need is execution of certain functions 
when this terminal condition is met, currently what i found is only way is custom implementation.
Second, 
For human in 
the loop, I don't want my user to enter prompt via terminal, I need it to be through WhatsApp message or some slack inte
gration. How do I do this?

Suggestions are welcomed. Or any other framework with these features..

all -  [ Integrating External REST API LLM Calls with LangGraph ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1ghc5pg/integrating_external_rest_api_llm_calls_with/) , 2024-11-05-0912
```

I'm working on implementing an agent system using LangGraph, but with a twist - my LLM calls need to go through a REST 
API service instead of using direct LLM integrations.

- Using LangGraph for agent orchestration
- Need to make LLM call
s via REST API endpoints
- Looking to build a custom agent that works with this architecture

1. Is it possible to integ
rate external REST API calls for LLM interactions within the LangGraph framework?
2. Are there any examples or best prac
tices for creating custom agents that use HTTP requests instead of direct LLM integrations?
3. What would be the recomme
nded approach to handle asynchronous REST API calls in this context?

## Technical Details Needed
- Best way to wrap RES
T API calls within LangGraph's expected interfaces
- How to handle authentication and session management
- Proper error 
handling and retry mechanisms
- State management considerations

Any guidance, examples, or pointers to relevant documen
tation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

all -  [ Fuzzy matching medical terminology using AI ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ghb3ei/fuzzy_matching_medical_terminology_using_ai/) , 2024-11-05-0912
```
Have a txt file with 2 columns, description and corresponding code. Need help intelligently matching user inputted free-
form text to the description, and returning the corresponding code.



Background:

I am building a medical pricing webs
ite. The user inputs free form text (à la Google) describing the condition and receives pricing at local hospitals.

Med
ical billing is a labyrinth, separated into inpatient and outpatient services and diagnosis codes. A diagnosis code (ICD
10) will usually translate into an inpatient code (DRG), but not always. Other times, ICD10 codes will translate to the 
wrong DRG code. 

I have been using a forward searching approach, searching first for the ICD10 code and translating it 
to a DRG. As an example, a search for 'heart transplant' yields the ICD10 code Z94.1 which corresponds to DRGs 314-316 (
'Other Circulatory System Diagnoses'). In fact, DRGs 001 and 002 ('Heart Transplant') are more correct, but do not have 
a corresponding ICD10 code. 

[CMS.gov](http://CMS.gov) has appendices that list exactly which ICD10 corresponds with wh
ich DRG as well as DRG numbers and descriptions. Not all DRGs have a corresponding ICD10 code, so **I will have to match
 the user-inputted free form text to DRGs directly.**



Things I have explored:

String matching using Jaccard Distance
/ Levenshtein Distance/ Jaro-Winkler: not the best since most laypeople will not know the exact medical terminology ('sn
oring' symptom vs 'sleep apnea' medical term)

Zero-shot approach with Gemini and OpenAI. Both AIs will hallucinate and 
return the wrong DRGs. 

* Fine tuning: OpenAI, Gemini, and Llama3.2 both require a question and answer dataset, best if
 50 examples per classification (DRG code). This is... not easy and probably not going to be very accurate. Hard to gues
s what a user might input in free form text.
* Corpus of documents for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): LangChain V
ectara, Gemini, Vertex AI for RAG: This is a promising option but examples on the [Vectara](https://python.langchain.com
/v0.1/docs/integrations/providers/vectara/vectara_summary/) site show that this approach is better for summarizing, or r
etrieving relevant 'chunks', than strict regurgitation.
* Vertex AI for tabular data: similar challenges with providing 
examples for fine tuning
* QLoRA/ LoRA: probably much more technically oriented and more than I need, also increased har
dware requirements.

Giving OpenAI/ Gemini a complete list of all the DRG descriptions with each prompt, asking the AI t
o match with the appropriate entry. This would use a large number of tokens ($) for every prompt. Is there a way to keep
 this in memory? Is that what the Corpus is? If I provide a text file as a document in the Corpus, is the AI smart enoug
h to match the user input to the DRG description in the file and return the corresponding DRG code in the file in a diff
erent column?

```
I want to create a model that analyzes specific books I've selected about coding and other related topics. My goal is fo
r this model to help integrate new features into the app, acting as a consultant by leveraging the knowledge from these 
books as well as the app's source code that I provide. I've already developed a basic model using LangChain and LLaMA th
at retrieves answers from the books, but I’m unsure how to proceed from this point. What steps should I take next to enh
ance this model?
