```
To make an api call to anthropic from my understanding u your need: 

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
mode
l = ChatAnthropic(model='claude-3-opus-20240229')

I have the API key setup in the .env file and the important is done c
orrectly. But it’s giving an error saying I need model name, timeout, api key. But the documentation says you just need 
to put the model. Does anyone knows why is this a problem?

Hey guys,

I recently made a a RAG-based github extension that responds directly to created 'issues' in github repositor
ies with a detailed overview of files and changes to make to resolve the issue. I see this as being particularly helpful
 for industry repositories where the codebases are quite big issues are frequently used.

Would love to know what you th
ink of the concept!

```
I’m trying to use Langchain to go through about 500k docs in total doing entity and relationship extractions. 

Before u
sing Langchain it was really quick but not very thorough or reliable. 

Now using 3 chains (one for entities, one for re
lationships, one for checking if anything is missed and adding if so)

However now it’s soooo slow. Using Azure GPT inst
ance should be able to do 100 rpm. Any advice?

Edit : new to this so let me know if this is a completely bad approach!

```
Hello everyone,

I have been working as a freelancer in the field of data analysis for about a year now and during this 
time I have intensively acquired Python and Langchain, with which I have already implemented some smaller projects. My p
rofessional background, however, is in soccer, where I worked for many years as a youth coach and video analyst for prof
essional teams.

Recently, I have been thinking hard about how I can combine my passion for soccer with my current skill
s in data and AI. I find computer vision projects in soccer particularly exciting, for example for tactical analysis, pl
ayer development or training optimization.

The areas of application in this field are extremely diverse and I am convin
ced that there is a growing market and strong demand for this. However, as I am still new to this area, I would be very 
happy to receive your feedback and assessments - especially regarding the current market and possible entry points.

Bes
t regards from Brazil/Germany

Philipp

all -  [ Philosophy major looking for dev helper ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1fx4m47/philosophy_major_looking_for_dev_helper/) , 2024-10-07-0913
```
Hi ! I am currently a research assistant working on a RAG project to test quality, response elements and validity of dif
ferent models when answering philosophy related questions. As of now the plan the project logic is closely related to th
e one presented in *An Automatic Ontology Generation Framework with An Organizational Perspective* \[[Elnagar (2020)](ht
tps://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05910)\]. The gist of it as far as I understood is to generate a knowledge graph from an unstru
ctured corpus, from which we make domain-specific ontology. 



This two-step program has a bunch of advantages detailed
 in the paper but one specific to this research project is to allow for hybrid KG and ontology generation, for domain-sp
ecific experts to be involved in knowledge integration. This is important in philosophy since discussed relations are of
ten very abstract. It would also be useful to monitor the evolution of semantic networks in the knowledge graph as in *A
rchitecture and evolution of semantic networks in mathematics texts* \[[Christianson et. al (2020)](https://www.research
gate.net/publication/343288312_Architecture_and_evolution_of_semantic_networks_in_mathematics_texts)\]. 



As of now th
e corpus has been manually collected, but future implementations of this project may include a module that collects key 
text of a domain from anna's archive API or something adjacent. I did try making some stuff up in a notebook and succeed
ed in some basic things, like word-cloud generation and [semantic hyper-graphs](https://graphbrain.net/). 



However, I
 would like for this project to move faster than I alone can do it, hence this post. I am a philosophy major and I simpl
y have too much stuff to figure out that is trivial to most of you, I don't even know how to use langchain ffs. I would 
still like to be highly involved in the process since I love to learn and it's important to me to get better at these th
ings. 



Depending on affinities this may or may not evolves in a longer collaborative relationship since I often use c
ode-adjacent ideas in my personal research *à la* Peter Naur, but this is beside the point for this post. Please contact
 me at [shrekrequiem@proton.me](mailto:shrekrequiem@proton.me) if you are interested. If this isn't the place for this I
 would also be highly thankful to redirect me to other subreddits or online spaces where this would be more appropriate.

```
For context, I'm basically a beginner at the LangChain codebase and want to find ways to contribute towards open source.
 Currently, I'm looking into contributing a Spotify tool for agents to use, but had a question about the file structure.


Under `libs/community/langchain_community/tools` exists all the tools that I'm assuming an agent can use, but not all 
of these tools have toolkits under `libs/community/langchain_community/agent_toolkits`.

So What are these toolkits exac
tly, and why would some of the implemented tools need them compared to others?

all -  [ How I deployed a NestJS task in as a Lambda to react to S3 events ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nestjs/comments/1fwu316/how_i_deployed_a_nestjs_task_in_as_a_lambda_to/) , 2024-10-07-0913
```
I'm working on a RAG application using nestjs, exposing an API to a vuejs application. One huge part of a RAG is about i
ngesting the data.  
  
The idea was to use a Lambda function that reacts to S3 bucket events and ingests the data. As I
 already had an API and lots of abstractions/wrappers over Langchain (js). I needed to maximize code reuse without havin
g to deploy the whole nestjs application in a lambda. Also, I didn't wanted to have a worker/queue on nestjs side for ha
ndling ingests.

After some research, I was able to turn my nest api into a nestjs monorepo, having two applications: th
e API, and a standalone application that basically only creates an nestjs application context and exposes a function han
dler. In the bootstrap, we store the application context in the global scope, which is persisted for a few minutes, even
 after the lambda finishes the execution.

The main issue here is that the way nestjs builds/bundles, it exposes a IIFE 
(Immediately Invoked Function Expression), so the handler function was not accessible outsite the module, Lambda could n
ot use it.

The solution I found was to build nestjs with webpack, specifically for \`libraryTarget: 'commonjs2'\`. Also
, in the webpack configuration I was able to reduce a lot of the bundle size with tree-shaking.

In the end of the day, 
I have a .cjs file exposing the handler function, and over 2MB of dependencies bundleded in separated .js files (compare
d with 400MB node\_modules in the whole application), so I can read/make small changes in the handler function directly 
in the AWS Lambda console for small changes/tests.

This lambda is reacting to events in s3. A book with 4MB and 600+ pa
ges (mainly text, few images) is taking about 20 seconds to ingest, and using about 256mb on lambda, which costs 0.08$ p
er 1k executions, only after 80K executions in the free tier - Of course that there are other costs involved, such as da
ta ingress/egress.  


I'm pretty happy with the results, after creating the wrapper for the lambda I could reuse basica
lly all of the code that I already had for ingesting files from the API.   
Not sure if I have overcomplicated this. Do 
you guys have any recommendations about this approach?

 now.

1. Provide the full library reference in a single markdown document.
2. Semantically split into chunks.
3. Togeth

4. Along with a really simple LangChain snippet that lets you chat with it.
5. Hosted on their websi

```
Hi all, got a bit of a conundrum here trying to get dynamic module loading with importlib to work properly 

I have the 
following package structure:

    my_project/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── llm_provider/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   
└── base_client.py (class BaseLLMProvider)
    ├── agents/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── base_agent.py
    │   └──
 basic_math_agent/
    │       ├── __init__.py
    │       └── agent.py
    └── supervisor/
        ├── __init__.py
    
    └── agent_manager.py

`agent_manager` attempts to dynamically load `basic_math_agent` using `importlib`, which works
 fine. However, `basic_math_agent` has a standard import statement of `from llm_provider.base_client import BaseLLMProvi
der`. This import fails, because as far as I am able to discern when using `importlib` to dynamically load a module, it 
does not share the same project root as the rest of the project, so `basic_math_agent` is unable to see `llm_provider`.


I receive this error:

    2024-10-04 10:33:50,288 [INFO] Starting Supervisor...

lm_provider/base_client.py)

In `my_project/__init__.py`, I try to update the sys root path to include the project root 
as I've seen suggested elsewhere, but it doesn't seem to work.

    import os
    import sys

    project_root = os.path
.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    sys.path.append(project_root)

Any suggestions on what best practice is here or 
how I can go about solving this?

all -  [ Advanced LLM parsing is the key to advanced AI applications. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fw5k23/advanced_llm_parsing_is_the_key_to_advanced_ai/) , 2024-10-07-0913
```
In my experience, when people consider applying LLMs to a project they often fall into two camps:

1. they turn the proj
ect into a chat bot
2. they use an LLM for some key feature in a larger application, resulting in an error prone mess

t
here's tremendous power in using LLMs to power specific features within larger applications, but LLMs inconsistency in o
utput structure makes it difficult to use their output within a programmatic system. You might ask an llm to output JSON
 data, for instance, and the LLM decides it's appropriate to wrap the data in a `\`\`\`json \`\`\`` markdown format. you
 might ask an LLM to output a list of values, and it responds with something like this:

    here's your list
    [1,2,3
,4]

There's an infinite number of ways LLM output can go wrong, which is why output parsing is a thing.

I've had the b
est luck, personally, with LangChain in this regard. [LangChain's pydantic parser](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how
_to/output_parser_structured/) allows one to define an object which is either constructed from the LLMs output, or an er
ror gets thrown. They essentially use a clever prompting system paired with the user's defined structure to coax the mod
el into a consistent output.

That's not fool proof either, which is why it's a common practice to either re-try or re-p
rompt. You can either just re-prompt on a failure, or pass the response which failed to parse to the LLM again and ask t
he LLM to correct it's mistake. For robust LLMs this works consistently enough where it's actually viable in application
s (assuming proper error handling). I made a post about [LangGraph](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fknby
i/langgraph_allows_you_to_make_falsifiable_testable/) recently, this can also be used to construct complex loops/decisio
ns which can be useful for adding a level of robustness into LLM responses.

If you can learn how to consistently turn a
n LLMs output into JSON, there's a whole world of possible applications.

I'm curious what LLM parsing tricks you employ
, and what you've seen the most success with!

```
guys as someone with 15+ yoe, I want to ask others who have experience, what advice would you give to the young new grad
s and those who are looking into the SWE and data careers?   
  
From my point of view:  I want to say that it's not wor
th pursuing careers in software or data analytics anymore, the AI crushing it, I can replace 5-6 people in current busin
ess that I work in, using Cursor Composer and Aider connected to sonnet3.5, and soon the o1 models will get upgraded to 
real gpt5 which will nail the multi-file editing better than sonnet and opus which are already amazing, these 2 years ar
e the last years of '6 figures' wages in tech, this is why: the number of businesses, existing and upcoming, is limited,
 and it will not grow all of a sudden to a x5 demand (x5 number of businesses need to appear), while the reduction in re
quired head count of software and data peeps goes down x5 if not x10 (if we consider upcoming gpt5 and new anthropic rel
eases in the next 2 years and link it into agents like [crew.ai](http://crew.ai/) and self written langchain (business s
pecific agents) the headcount required to deliver the business goals goes down x10 easily, WHILE universities are still 
full of upcoming SWEs and AI/ML data scientists, who are students now, and they'll be in the market too (in addition to 
all self-taught folks from east europe, latam, asia, and their uni of course, who are looking for remote work) it's goin
g to be a bloodbath, I can already hire engineers for 2-3k euro in Poland, Serbia, Asia, India, Mexico, who were until r
ecently non-existent (before covid we had not much practice of such massive outsourcing as we do now, at the moment ever
y business looking to cut costs and opens offices in Belgrade and Bucharest etc'). 

The big tech swims in money so they
'll keep paying 6 figures for a while, to the most experienced leads and seniors, staff, directors, but it'll go down to
 'back to reality' rates which are below 6 figures in the next 5-6 years as well, and the competition for the roles is a
lready fierce. If you want to work routinely 10-12 hours a day, PLUS keep yourself up to date on latest tech and in good
 shape of algorithms (add 2-3 hours a week to keep yourself in shape) this career is for you, BUT high rates are no long
er guaranteed for folks who want a quiet 9-5 office job. the more hardcore nerds like me, who have no life, no kids, no 
hobbies, will keep the high paying jobs, but this shit is not for regular healthy people, so my sincere advice for young
 folks would be to stay away from SWE and try hardware networking, chip manufacturing, biology, space sciences, aerospac
e (probably best niche in upcoming future), defense (obviously, but take care of karma so you don't end up in hell lol, 
not worth the 6 figures), microbiology, medicine, ocean stuff, oil and gas and geo sciences maybe, agriculture science i
n upcoming climate change might be good direction too since there's a lot of trouble in the sector that needs fixing, an
d so on. just my sincere 2 cents :)))

I hope this will help someone to make a good decision in life, you're welcome to 
disagree and I know I might be completely wrong and 'new businesses and new use cases for SWEs will get created in the u
pcoming golden age of AI' theory of the youtubers exists ('influencers' :D the ones who can't make $$ in tech and become
 youtubers to make ends meet, they aren't the best ones to listen to honestly, I'm sorry guys. but just think about it, 
we're dying in tech jobs with 10-12 hour shifts already, who of us in a sane mind will be a youtube influencer in our fr
ee time, for 5$ per 10000 views or smth? when our rates are 100-120$/hour at work, why would we do youtube?? don't liste
n to these dummies, they're on youtube cos the job is too hard for them anyway).

Take care!

* Sparse BM25 search on Postgres through ParadeDB's pg\_search

I am trying to use Gemini's [text-embedding-004](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/embeddings) model in LangChain ho
wever LangChain only supports text-embedding-001 according to this [doc](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/
text_embedding/google_generative_ai/). I tried to change 001 to 004 but it returns error saying that the model is not su
pported. I am just curious why LangChain only supports 001, which is not mentioned anywhere in the current doc of Google
.

Those two services seem to be the most advanced and actively developed solutions for this. I am not sure which way to go
, especially since Langfuse's architecture will soon be very similar than that of Helicone's, see [https://github.com/or
gs/langfuse/discussions/1902](https://github.com/orgs/langfuse/discussions/1902) . The pricing of the non-self hosted ve
rsions are quite comparable, however it seems that Helicone does offer model output caching, which means it pays basical
ly by itself for our use case. On the other hand Langfuse seems to have a more comprehensive documentation and more self
 hosted centric development, not entirely sure.

What are your experiences using one of those services? Can you recommen
d one or another similar tool?

Hey everyone! 👋

I've been working on this cool little web app called RFP Analyzer. It's basically a tool that helps you
 break down Request for Proposal (RFP) documents and your responses to them. Super handy if you're dealing with a lot of
 these in your work!

[video screen recording of the rfp analyzer tool in action](https://reddit.com/link/1fv4i0m/video/
jofsq8inpisd1/player)

**What it does:**

* You upload your RFP and response PDFs
* It processes them and gives you a ne
at summary
* You can chat with an AI about the documents, so you can also use it to validate if your actually capturing 
the data from the document correctly
* It generates a report comparing the two

**UI using web tech (Flask, HTMX, Alpine
.js).**

I will soon open-sourced it on GitHub, so feel free to check it out, star it, or even 
contribute if you're feeling generous! Feel free to ask questions :)

```
Thanks to the open-source gods! Meta finally released the multi-modal language models. There are two models: a small 11B
 one and a mid-sized 90B one.

The timing couldn't be any better, as I was looking for an open-access vision model for a
n application I am building to replace GPT4o.

So, I wanted to know if I can supplement GPT4o usage with Llama 3.2; thou
gh I know it’s not a one-to-one replacement, I expected it to be good enough considering Llama 3 70b performance, and it
 didn’t disappoint.

I tested the model on various tasks that I use daily,

* General Image Understanding
   * Image cap
tioning
   * counting objects
   * identifying tools
   * Plant disease identification
* Medical report analysis
* Text 
extraction
* Chart analysis

Consider going through this article to dive deeper into the tests. [Meta Llama 3.2: A deep 
dive into vision capabilities.:](https://composio.dev/blog/meta-llama-3-2-a-deep-dive-into-vision-capabilities/)

# What
 did I feel about the model?

The model is great and, indeed, a great addition to the open-source pantheon. It is excell
ent for day-to-day use cases, and considering privacy and cost, it can be a potential replacement for GPT-4o for this ki
nd of task.

However, GPT-4o is still better for difficult tasks, such as medical imagery analysis, stock chart analysis
, and similar tasks.

I have yet to test them for getting the coordinates of objects in an image to create bounding boxe
s. If you have done this, let me know what you found.

Also, please comment on how you liked the model’s vision performa
nce and what use cases you plan on using it for.

- [https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/ChatRAG-Bench](https://huggingface.co

But these feel overly reductive, since they don't address complexities like:  
1) when
 to retrieve vs. just respond immediately to reduce latency  
2) rely on existing context previously retrieved in the co
nversation instead of retrieving again at the current turn  
3) partition LLM context between retrieved information and 
past conversation history.

I'm sure some teams already have good systems for this, would appreciate pointers!

MachineLearning -  [ Built a web agent which call fill Google forms based on the user details [P] ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fozud5/built_a_web_agent_which_call_fill_google_forms/) , 2024-10-07-0913
```
GitHub repo : [https://github.com/shaRk-033/web-agent](https://github.com/shaRk-033/web-agent)

Tried to solve it using 
two approaches:

# 1: Basic Scraping and Filling

This is the straightforward approach. The agent scrapes the form’s HTM
L and uses fixed XPaths to find and fill in the required fields.

* It pulls the form’s HTML, locates the fields with se
t XPaths, and inputs the answers. It’s a direct and simple method.
* If the form changes or an element isn’t where it’s 
expected, the process can fail and may need manual adjustments.

[basic approach](https://preview.redd.it/5e8g4a1k4xqd1.
png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8e984e4feaee2f0453b08c8696768c40a2a5c20)

2. Using LangChain Agents and tool call
ing

* LangChain Agent**:** The agent handles everything by using the LLM’s reasoning to decide what to do next, includi
ng generating those tricky XPaths.
* Error Handling**:** If something goes wrong (like an element not found), the agent 
tries again with better XPaths until it gets the job done.

[using langchain agents](https://preview.redd.it/948i88pl4xq
d1.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed1e6c19efec9f4cbbbd6ab5a22558f221cf745f)

Any recommendations to improve this w
ould be welcome. Also, if anyone has ideas on building similar web agents to automate other tasks, it would be great to 
hear them. :)

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Swapping Embedding Models for an LLM ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fktvbj/p_swapping_embedding_models_for_an_llm/) , 2024-10-07-0913
```
How tightly coupled is an embedding model to a language model?

Taking an example from Langchain's tutorials, they use O
llama's _nomic-embed-text_ for embedding and _Llama3.1_ for the understanding and Q/A. I don't see any documentation abo
ut Llama being built on embeddings from this embedding model. 

Intuition suggests that a different embedding model may 
produce outputs of other sizes or produce a different tensor for a character/word, which would have an impact on the res
ults of the LLM. So would changing an embedding model require retraining/fine-tuning the LLM as well?

I need to use a e
mbedding model for code snippets and text. Do I need to find a specialized embedding model for that? If yes, how will ll
ama3.1 ingest the embeddings?

```
Ok, so I am currently trying to build support chatbot with following technicalities 
1. FastAPI for web server(Need to m
ake it faster)
2. Qdrant as Vector Data Base(Found it to be the fastest amongst Chromadb, Elastic Search and Milvus)
3. 
MongoDB for storing all the data and feedback.
4. Semantic chunking with max token limit of 512.
5. granite-13b-chat-v2 
as the LLM(I know it's not good but I have limited options available)
6. The data is structured as well as unstructured.
 Thinking of having involving GraphRAG with current architecture.
7. Multiple data sources stored in multiple collection
s of vector database because I have implemented an access control.
8. Using mongoengine currently as a ORM. If you know 
something better please suggest.
9. Using all-miniLM-l6-v2 as vector embedding currently but planning to use stella_en_4
00M_v5.
10. Using cosine similarity to retrieve the documents.
11. Using BLEU, F1 and BERT score for automated evaluatio
n based on golden answer.
12. Using top_k as 3.
13. Currently using basic question answering prompt but want to improve 
it. Any tips? Also heard about Automatic Prompt Evaluation.
14. Currently using custom code for everything. Looking to u
se Llamaindex or Langchain for this. 
15. Right now I am not using any AI Agent, but I want to know your opinions. 
16. 
It's a simple RAG framework and I am working on improving it.
17. I haven't included reranker but I am planning to do so
 too.

I think I mentioned pretty much everything I am using for my project. So please share your suggestions, comments 
and reviews for the same. Thank you!!

deeplearning -  [ What is the best approach for Parsing and Retrieving Code Context Across Multiple Files in a Hierarc ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1fh58oz/what_is_the_best_approach_for_parsing_and/) , 2024-10-07-0913
```
I want to implement a Code-RAG system on a code directory where I need to:

* Parse and load all the files from folders 
and subfolders while excluding specific file extensions.
* Embed and store the parsed content into a vector store.
* Ret
rieve relevant information based on user queries.

However, I’m facing two major challenges:

**File Parsing and Loading
:** What’s the most efficient method to parse and load files in a hierarchical manner (reflecting their folder structure
)? Should I use Langchain’s directory loader, or is there a better way? I came across the Tree-sitter tool in Claude-dev
’s repo, which is used to build syntax trees for source files—would this be useful for hierarchical parsing?

**Cross-Fi
le Context Retrieval:** If the relevant context for a user’s query is spread across multiple files located in different 
subfolders, how can I fine-tune my retrieval system to identify the correct context across these files? Would reranking 
resolve this, or is there a better approach?

**Query Translation:** Do I need to use Something like Multi-Query or RAG-
Fusion to achieve better retrieval for hierarchical data?

\[I want to understand how tools like [continue.dev](http://c
ontinue.dev/) and [claude-dev](https://github.com/saoudrizwan/claude-dev) work\]
