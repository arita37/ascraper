[https://github.com/Rivridis/LLM-Assistant](https://github.com/Rivridis/LLM-Assistant)

This is an attempt to make a LLM
 application that can call functions and search the internet, all without langchain or any complex setups. This is based
 purely on llama-cpp-python and can be run using any gguf models which uses the ChatML prompting format.

I used RAG for
 searching the internet, using DuckDuckGo search engine, and appending the search result to the system prompt. All other
 functions are called based on the example given in system prompt.

I even added a Gradio chat UI, and I shall find a wa
y to add stuff like uploading documents and searching from them (Maybe by using some vector database).

If anyone has an
y feature ideas or improvement to the code, feel free to let me know, as I plan to make this project even more feature r
ich, once I find a way to make the LLM choose multiple functions instead of the current one function at a time.

```
I'm an experienced senior dev trying to learn how to leverage LLMs in an application.

First, I am well aware of their l
imitations. In my experimentation with ChatGPT/Bard/Copilot/etc on the web, they seem to be pretty solid at analyzing da
ta I feed to it, rather than expecting them to just 'know' things where they constantly hallucinate. Still, I think it's
 a very useful skill to have with the hype going on, and I want to understand it.

Second, the field is definitely quite
 new. There aren't a lot of good frameworks and abstractions, which isn't a bad thing because I prefer to start at a low
er level anyway to understand things. For example, LangChain comes up in all my searches but I have read so many mixed t
hings about it. So I'm staying away from the abstractions and trying to learn the concepts.

I'm hoping for guidance to 
good educational materials on:

1. Embeddings
2. Vector databases
3. Using your own data from a database with LLM querie
s.
4. Prompt engineering - this one seems a bit over hyped, it seems to basically be just 'be very specific and detailed
' so I don't care as much about this one.

Thanks in advance for any direction that can be offered.

Hey folks, 

I've been pondering the process of embedding in a RAG app using various models. When examining examples, I 
noticed that some models (the most popular ones) include their embeddings. However, if I want to perform embedding with 
a different foundation model or an instructive one, what's the procedure? Do I need to extract the truncated version of 
the LLM to create the embedding model, or is there a process I'm not familiar with?

```
I'm an experienced senior software engineer who just hasn't touched LLMs before. My goal is to learn how to integrate an
 LLM into an application to do tasks like data analysis, leveraging data in the application alongside new inputs to maxi
mize the accuracy of the results. So far my research has led me to the following:

1. Store my data, or a limited replic
a of the important parts, in a vector database as embeddings. This makes it easier and more efficient to query for relev
ant data and feed to the LLM.

2. Everything needs to go into the prompt. Embeddings can help, but I need to feed everyt
hing to the LLM with detailed instructions.

3. The tooling around this is pretty mixed. For example, LangChain keeps co
ming up in my searches but there are so many conflicting opinions around it I'm hesitant to adopt it.

So anyway, I'm lo
oking for learning resources. I'm fine with it being lower level, Ie avoiding abstractions like LangChain and hand rolli
ng things. Long term higher abstractions are better, but for learning I can benefit from understanding the fundamental m
echanics.

Ideally I need to understand more about vector databases and embeddings so I can understand their true value 
beyond mere buzzwords. I'm sure there are plenty of pros and cons, which I need to understand to know when to leverage t
his tool.

Then of course how to feed embeddings to the LLM in an optimal way along with my prompts. I'm finding lots of
 good articles on prompt engineering, so that is good.

Lastly, the best free/super cheap LLMs to test with. For prod ap
ps you want the best, Ie GPT4 or the like. But for this, I'm learning. I care less about top-notch results and more abou
t saving my wallet while educating myself.

Thanks for reading this wall of text. Looking forward to any feedback and di
rection on educational resources. Thanks.

\- Should I include side projects as opposed to my 'Com

\- Is my impact for my experience sufficient? 
More specifically, does it follow the STAR format? Is there anything I should change or keep?

\- Does the technical ski

Hi. I'm tasked with building a chatbot for work. We are an HR tech company. 

I'm using Retrieval QA, trying different c
hunking sizes, testing both Pinecone and Supabase for vector Retrieval. 

However, I'm of the opinion that our data suck
s. Our API docs have like 50 words per page at most, and there are maybe 30 pages. We have a lot of support tickets, lik
e 500, but only 20% have actual answers written out to the ticket reason. So I get maybe 20-50 words per useable ticket.
 Lastly, our community sourced internal documentation is fragmentation and inconsistently designed. 

I've engineered al
l the text into consistent structures. The purpose is Q/A, like 'If a user is complaining X isn't working in their dashb
oard, what might be the cause?'

But is there anything realistic I can do with this situation when the data is so low vo
lume and poor quality? Any technical approaches that don't require a manual documentation overhaul, that is.

ity in the comment section. For a community that comes together for the LangChain package and ecosystem, there seems to 
be a surprising amount of people that don't like it. The advice given is often to not use LangChain at all.

Personally,
 I have been impressed by the developer's willingness to listen to the community, and would expect this to lead to a pos
itive mindset in the community. For example the introduction of LCEL is an attempt to improve the code quality and reduc
e the complexity of applications build with LangChain. However, [the community does not seem to see its value](https://w
ww.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/18t3jn9/do_we_really_need_lcel/).

While I understand some of the criticism, I don't 
believe the amount of negativity is justified. Moreover, it seems there is little willingness for constructive feedback 
that could be used to improve the situation. This post is a plea to improve this mindset for the betterment of the LangC
hain ecosystem and the community that uses it. With LangChain having just released version 0.1, I think this is a good m

```
Hey Langchain enthusiasts!

I’ve noticed a lot of chatter about the steep learning curve of Langchain. So, I thought I’d
 share my approach that makes it not only manageable but also pretty awesome to use.

🚀 The Game-Changer: I tweaked the 
Langchain chatbot (open-source, yay!) by swapping out the GPT-3.5 model with the shiny new GPT-4, boasting a massive 128
K context window. This upgrade means we can feed it a hefty amount of chain reference code. The result? Writing substant
ial code segments that require minimal tweaking!

🛠️ Here’s How You Can Do It Too:

	1.	Set the Stage: Clone the chat-la
ngchain repo and set it up as per the guidelines. A piece of cake!
	2.	The Magic Swap: In chain.py, replace “GPT-3.5-tur
bo” with “gpt-4-1106-preview”. Boost the number of retrieved chunks (I’m rocking search_kwargs=dict(k=20)).
	3.	Prompt P
erfection: Modify the prompt (example below) and ensure your initial description is crystal clear. Dropping in known cla
ss names helps the bot understand your needs better. 

Happy coding!



Here’s the prompt I’m using:

```
Loks like Copilot Studio is being rolled out (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio
) with an impressive looking no code/out of the box RAG solution.

There is a phenomenal amount of development and activ
ity in the Open Source RAG world (e.g Langchain, Llamaindex, etc), which I am a great supporter of FYI.

However, what s
eems strange is that this no code out of the box solution (Copilot Studio - just as an example of one) seems overwhelmin
gly to be the better option if you wanted to build a RAG app i.e If you compare the cost to build and productionise a cu
stom RAG app vs the cost of using Copilot Studio, it's almost an order of magnitude lower (no matter how you cut it with
 the developer time and duration). 

My question is, it seems to me we are moving towards a situation where enterprise s
olutions will make custom RAG apps redundant (not in all cases of course, but most cases), however there seems to be ver
y little discussion of this relative to the activity in the open source community. Do people agree this is a likely scen
ario? 

Obviously there will be exceptions…but on most use cases I don’t see how you can compete with an instant/minimal
 setup, low cost, highly scalable RAG solution.

MachineLearning -  [ [Project] Temporal Augmented Retrieval (TAR) - Dynamic RAG ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/18uddmj/project_temporal_augmented_retrieval_tar_dynamic/) , 2024-01-14-0911
```
From a corpus of text, how can you detect emerging topics and their evolution through time?

Introducing Temporal Augmen
ted Retrieval (TAR). (built in the context of buildspace n&w s4)

TAR is an open-source advanced RAG approach that aims 
to factor in the dynamic and temporal aspects of textual data when performing retrieval.

It allows us to understand the
 evolution of discussed topics over time.

The idea behind this project is to open the debate regarding the current limi
tations of RAG methods

This first approach has been built without using RAG frameworks (like Jerry Liu’s langchain) and
 focuses on financial tweets

MachineLearning -  [ [R][P] Autogen + Langchain Tools + Local LLM doesn't work. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/18tex1j/rp_autogen_langchain_tools_local_llm_doesnt_work/) , 2024-01-14-0911
```
Hey folks, 

So I'm playing around with the agent framework Autogen and I'm trying to create agents by providing it cust
om tools to use. These custom tools are defined in the langchain framework. Furthermore, I am using open source LLM mode
ls like Mistral, LLAMA, Mixtral etc.

In my experience, I have been unable to get the Autogen+LocalLLM framework to iden
tify the right tools to use given the prompt. However it does a fantastic job with the GPT model. 

Please note that my 
goal is for the agent to mandatorily use the tools provided and not come up with its own code. And the agent should figu
re out the right tool to use. 

I have been very explicit with my prompting, despite which I am unable to get this to wo
rk.

Any thoughts and suggestions? Please let me know ! Please share your experiences as well. Cheers !

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Seeking Advice for Building a School Handbook Chatbot Using OpenAI and Vector Databases ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/18rndcp/p_seeking_advice_for_building_a_school_handbook/) , 2024-01-14-0911
```
Hello everyone,

I'm embarking on a project to create a chatbot for my school's handbook, aiming to make it a resource f
or students to easily access information. As someone relatively new to AI, I'm seeking guidance on implementing this.

M
y current plan is to use OpenAI as the primary language learning model, focusing on affordability. I am considering inte
grating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and LangChain for enhanced functionality. However, I'm quite perplexed abou
t choosing an appropriate vector database, as many options appear costly. The goal is to keep this system live and acces
sible for student usage without breaking the bank.

I'm also looking into open-source embedding models to pair with the 
vector database. Pinecone has caught my attention, but its pricing seems steep for our budget.

Does anyone have recomme
ndations or tips on affordable yet effective tools and strategies for this project? Any insights on vector databases sui
table for educational use, or ways to optimize cost without compromising quality, would be greatly appreciated.

Thank y
ou in advance for your help!

(I typed out my problem and had gpt4 fix up the format and wording dont bash me)
