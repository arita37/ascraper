**My experience with Langchain**

One of the key advantages of Langchain is its ability to integrate
 different LLMs into your applications. This flexibility allows you to experiment with various models and find the one t
hat best suits your needs.

Langchain's approach is a game-changer. However, I do have one gripe - the documentation cou
ld be better. I wasn't aware that I needed to use the ChatModels instead of the direct models, and this wasn't specified
 clearly enough. This kind of information is crucial for users to get up and running quickly.

# My Experience setting it up with Ollama

I've used HuggingFace for using O
pen Source LLMs all this while. I admit that had it's own hassles but it wasn't very hard to set up as long as you paid 
good attention to the docs. This time i decided to use Ollama. I run a windows machine, so i installed it and struggled 
for a bit in terms of setting it up and using it with Langchain. You have to use ChatOllama and not just Ollama, but it 
was very easy to bind the tools using Composio. I also tried setting it up on Colab but running the server, connecting i
t to the agent with a trigger is difficult.

As for connecting with Slack i used triggers on Composio. You can use it to
 connect agents to Slack and set a trigger everytime the bot is tagged and a message is sent, its also LLM agnostic. I u
sed it for my previous project and it worked very well.

```
Hi r/langchain, I'm sharing an example on building a multi-modal search application using GPT-4o, featuring extraction o
f metadata and hybrid indexing for accurately retrieving relevant information from presentations.

* Repo: [~https://git
hub.com/pathwaycom/llm-app/tree/main/examples/pipelines/slides\_ai\_search~](https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app/tree/
main/examples/pipelines/slides_ai_search)
* Architecture: [~https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app/tree/main/examples/pip
elines/slides\_ai\_search#architecture~](https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app/tree/main/examples/pipelines/slides_ai_se
arch#architecture)

This project also focuses on automatically updating indexes as changes happen in your repository.Â   

  
**Quick details:**

* **Ingestion:** The application reads slide files (PPTX and PDF) stored locally or on Google Dr
ive or Microsoft SharePoint.
* **Parsing:** Utilizes the SlideParser from Pathway, configured with a detailed schema. Th
e app parses images, charts, diagrams, and other visual elements as well, and features automatic unstructured metadata e
xtraction.Â 
* **Indexing:** Parsed slide content is embedded using OpenAI's embedder and stored in Pathway's vector stor
e ([natively available on LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pathway/)) that is
 optimized for incremental indexing.

**How it helps:**

1. Text in presentations is often limited. This example removes
 the need to manually sift through countless presentations by recalling keywords.
2. Organize your slide library by topi
c or other criteria. Indexes update automatically whenever a slide is added, modified, or removed.

**Preliminary Result
s:**

* This method has proven to be efficient in managing large volumes of slides, ensuring that the most up-to-date an
d accurate information is available. It significantly enhances productivity by streamlining the search process across Po
werPoints, PDFs, and Slides.

Open to your questions and feedback!

all -  [ How are you managing long form content? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1dzxzu0/how_are_you_managing_long_form_content/) , 2024-07-11-0911
```
I'm trying to get Claude to generate content that could be up to 8,000 tokens long.

To overcome the max token output li
mitations, I have specifically prompted Claude to stop generating when the max token limit is reached, and then continue
 exactly where you left off when the user responds with a 'continue' message.

  
Example of the prompt:

    const prom
pt = `
    Generate me an adventure story that is between 6000 - 7000 words long
    If you reach the max token output, 
the user will send a message saying 'continue'
    Before continuing, you should check the previous outputs and start ex
actly where you left off so that the output is coherent and consistent. 
    You should not ackowledge the 'continue' me
ssage in the output, just continue generating the content. 
    We will join the outputs together at the end and they sh
ould form a coherent and consistent response. 
    If you have finished generating the content and the user asks you to 
continue, you should just respond with an empty message. 
    
    For example: 
      Assistant: mess 
      User: cont
inue 
      Assistant: age   
    `

The problem is that it won't do as I ask, it just keeps shortening the story, I fin
d this weird because when I change the max tokens to something like, 50 and then change the requested story to have a le
ngth of 200 words, it works fine for multiple continuations.

Anyone faced this before?

I am developing a PDF RAG app .   
In the previous version of Langchain ( i.e. v0.1 ) , we had RetrievalQA class , but n

In thi
s same doc , it is mentioned to use create\_retrieval\_chain . 

But but but , in the RetrievalQA class we had an option
 to pass memory as parameter . How to pass memory ( ConversationSummaryMemory ) in this create\_retrieval\_chain class ?


    Â  Â  Â  Â  rag = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  llm=ChatOpenAI(

- Test chunk sizes and top K retrieval settings
- Get relevance scores for retrieved passages

- No external API needed - uses fine tuned local models
- Integrates with LangChain or other orchestrators

Great for op

all -  [ Agent Retrieval - How we almost always find the right vectors. Pt 3 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1dzfp48/agent_retrieval_how_we_almost_always_find_the/) , 2024-07-11-0911
```
Hey all - 



Today I wanted to run through how we narrow down our vector space.

**Issues with vector search only:**

*
 If you have used vector search over a large corpus of documents, you'll know vector search doesn't work well.
* Almost 
100% of the time someone is using RAG, they are looking for something specific.
   *  Example: If you use vector search 
on a name, most names will come back, regardless of it's Bob Smith, or Sally Blu. This is bad if I just want to find Sal
ly Blu.



W**hat are we doing?** 

1. We split each doc up into the smallest possible vector (normally sentences) We've
 found this is the best, and most accurate for vector similarity. 
2. NER/Keyword extraction from the query
3.  Search d
ocs for keywords/NER
4. Vector search query within the docs that are returned.
5.  Traditionally top 20 results (no simi
larity score min)
6. Reconstruct the docs into headers etc.
7. Reranker Jina - top 10 results (over .x similarity)
8. Ea
ch result sent to an LLM for quotes
9. combine all into prompt #2
10. LLM answer

Today we'll primarily talk through ste
p 2-7.



**How?**

*Example query:* Does Sally blu work at tada?

1. Use an LLM to extract named entities and key words
/phrases from the query. 
2. Search the entire document to see if 'all' keywords/NER match the doc. \['Tada' and 'Sally 
Blu'\]
3. If there's no matches, do an 'or' search for keywords/NER \['Tada' or 'Sally Blu'\]
4. If there's no matches, 
don't return a doc.
5. If there are matches in either step 2 or 3, return those docs only and do vector search within on
ly those documents. 

This significantly limits the scope of the vector space and based on our experiences almost never 
filters out the documents that are important to answering the question.



**How are we able to search an entire doc?** 


This process wouldn't be possible without out our document structure, so here's a link & a quick overview of how we ho
w we [chunk docs. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1dpbc4g/how_we_chunk_turning_pdfs_into_hierarchical/)

T
LDR: We extract and save the document structure into a hieratical format, headers, sub-headers, list, paragraphs, tables
, etc. Because we do this, we can easily search the entire document. 



**Diagram of our first pass search**

https://p
review.redd.it/jczepvzejkbd1.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7818f84954b2486793cb012f02b7097b988859c

**Example Qu
ery:**

u/warriorA asked this question a couple of days ago in another post. It's simple so we'll re-use it:

\_\_\_\_\_
\_

Consider the query: 'How many Presidents did we have in America?'



Now we might have a document chunk with this in
formation:

1.   doc\_1\_chunk: 'United States has been governed by a total of 46 people'  
2.   doc\_2\_chunk: 'The USA
 is a country in north america.'  
3.   doc\_3\_chunk: 'We've had 1 President in 'Random-Country'.'



Wouldn't your sea
rch fail?



Note - (I made a few small edits for example purposes)

\_\_\_\_\_\_



**Would our system work for this us
e case?** 

Most likely, yes. 



From the query we'd extract: \['Presidents' & 'America'\] 

Again, we search the entir
e document, not just the chunks to find hits.

â Doc\_1: It's very likely that doc\_1 would contain both the word presid
ent and America, meaning that document would come back. 

â Doc\_2:  Isn't talking about Presidents, thus it wouldn't co
me back.

âor â Doc\_3: Would most likely not come back as it's not talking about America. (If it did come back because 
America was in the document somewhere, vector search + rerankers would help filter it out.)



**If we extended chunk on
e:** 

here's an example of what it would look like and it contains both the word president & america.

https://preview.

If we didn't do 
this step, it's likely all 3 chunks would come back, and doc\_3\_chunk, would be rated the highest. You could imagine if
 you had hundreds or thousands of documents the most important vectors to answer the question may not show up at all.

**
how do we extract NER?** 

We have found the NER models aren't consistent enough, you have to use an LLM. If you ask a q
uestion like 'what are the terms of the wings contract' a NER model may see no named entities, where an LLM would unders
tand the named entity is 'wings'.



**Prompt:**

Respond with valid json. 

You will receive text, your goal is to: 

1
. Identify potential search phrases. Put those in the 'P' field. For example, in 'When was the Huck Finn contract signed
?', the main concept is 'Huck Finn contract' 

2. Identify named entities. Put those in the 'N' field. For example: 'Huc
k Finn' or 'Apple A7' Emit a valid JSON object with a single 'N' field and a single 'P' field. 

	Example 

	Input: When
 was the Huck Finn contract signed? 

	Output: 

	{ 

	'P': \['Huck Finn contract'\], 

	'N': \['Huck Finn'\],

	} 

	In
put: does share and perform offer a performance engagement tool 

	Output: 

	{ 

	'P': \['share and perform performance
 engagement'\], 

	'N': \['share and perform'\],

	} 

	Input: how many processors in the apple a7? 

	{ 

	'P': \['appl
e a7 processors'\], 

	'N': \['Apple', 'Apple A7'\], 

	} 

	Input: How much is the wings contract Output: 

	{ 'P': \['
wings contract'\],

	'N': \['wings'\], 

	} 

	Input: what are the different tiers of wotc? 

	Output: 

	{

	'P': \['wo
tc tiers'\], 

	'N': \['WOTC'\], 

	} 

	Input: what is included in the QuickBooks General Journal report Output: 

	{


	'P': \['QuickBooks General Journal report'\], 

	'N': \['Quickbooks'\], 

	} 

	Example '



Why did we decide on this 
prompt? 

* We use P & N because the less tokens than doing something like named entities & keywords. This mean there's 
less tokens the LLM needs to return. (The average response time is 1.1 seconds.)
* We found you need a large example set
 for the LLM to understand what you're trying to do.
* We recommend tuning these prompts to questions that your customer
 may similarly ask



**Next step:**

After finding the top 20 vectors, we re-construct the document.  Because re-ranker
s tend to work better, and we are giving them additional context, we've found that we almost always return the most rele
vant chunks to answer the question. Here's our[ article](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1dtr49t/agent_rag_p
arallel_quotes_how_we_built_rag_on/) for going from vectors to search.

all -  [ Stream with structured output ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1dz4ga0/stream_with_structured_output/) , 2024-07-11-0911
```
Hello, community

Could you please help me to cope with streaming of the structured output in Langchain?  
The example b
elow has a simple idea: to generate JSON of fake biographies in a stream. I have a simple FastAPI part:

    from dotenv
 import load_dotenv
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    
    from typing import AsyncIterable
    from fastapi.responses
 import StreamingResponse
    
    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
    from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPr
omptTemplate
    from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field
    from langchain_core.output_parsers import J
sonOutputParser
    
    
    load_dotenv()
    app = FastAPI()
    
    
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
('human', 'Generate biography for {n} persons'))
    model = ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125')
    
    
    class 
Biography(BaseModel):
        name: str = Field(description='The first name of the person')
        surname: str = Field
(description='The surname of the person')
        birth_place: str = Field(description='The birth place of the person')

        biography: str = Field(description='The biography of the person')
    
    
    class Biographies(BaseModel):
  
      biographies: list[Biography] = Field(description='The list of biographies of the persons')
    
    
    model = m
odel.with_structured_output(Biographies)
    chain = prompt | model | JsonOutputParser()
    
    
    async def send_me
ssage(n_persons: int) -> AsyncIterable[str]:
        async for chunk in chain.astream({'n': n_persons}):
            yie
ld chunk
    
    
    u/app.post('/stream_biographies/')
    async def stream_biographies(persons: int):
        genera
tor = send_message(persons)
        return StreamingResponse(generator, media_type='text/event-stream')
    
    
    if
 __name__ == '__main__':
        import uvicorn
        uvicorn.run(app)from dotenv import load_dotenv
    

And a snipp
et, how I test it:

    import httpx
    
    url = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/stream_biographies/'
    data = {'persons': 2
}
    
    headers = {'Content-type': 'application/json',
               'accept': 'application/json'}
    
    with htt
px.stream('POST', url, params=data, headers=headers) as r:
        for chunk in r.iter_text():
            print(chunk)i
mport httpx
    
    url = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/stream_biographies/'
    data = {'persons': 2}
    
    headers = {'Co
ntent-type': 'application/json',
               'accept': 'application/json'}
    
    with httpx.stream('POST', url, pa
rams=data, headers=headers) as r:
        for chunk in r.iter_text():
            print(chunk)

I expect json generation
 on the fly, like in this example [https://baml-examples.vercel.app/examples/get-recipe](https://baml-examples.vercel.ap
p/examples/get-recipe)

However, I get error

    pydantic.v1.error_wrappers.ValidationError: 1 validation error for Gen
erationChunk 
    text
      str type expected (type=type_error.str)

If I remove output parser from the chain, I get `A
ttributeError: 'Biographies' object has no attribute 'encode'`

So I think, the problem is in returning Biographies obje
ct, and not the JSON from the chain, but I don't know, how to fix it. Any help is appreciated

```
Hello, Im Mid Level Full Stack Developer, i used to work with mainly JS/TS 

I worked in local companies in Algeria for 
3 years, then i moved to freelance for 2 years, but I'm struggling in freelance because i couldn't find some long-term c
ontract while i'm aiming for stability, but unfortunately i couldn't find that.

During this 2 years i tried to launch f
ew small businesses but i failed for some reasons, and now I'm thinking to move to remote jobs.

I heard that remote job
s for developers are mainly for seniors, even im not senior yet, and this is increased the imposter syndrome feeling ins
ide me.

Here is what I'm good in (my skills) :

- Programming Languages: Javascript/Typescript, few of Python, and lear
ning Golang

- Front End Frameworks: React/NextJS only

- Back End Frameworks: ExpressJS, NestJS 

- Databases: MongoDB 
and PostgreSQL, mainly with ORM like Prisma and TypeORM

- IaaS: Azure and willing to learn AWS

- Others: Docker, Langc
hain, GitHub Actions

- Improvement Area: Testing (willing to learn this month)

- Projects I made:  
   â¢ News AI Scrap
per and Summarizer (Freelance): Service used by Norwegian news company to scrape and summarize and rephrase news from ot
her websites and then publish it in other platforms like their website and social media platforms

   â¢ Worked during a 
month in few tasks (Freelance) in Airtable Extensions Platform and adding some features in the platform and fixing some 
bugs

   â¢ AI Copywriting tool for E-commerce Stores: Built a startup for generating product descriptions, blogs, and SE
O checks using AI (failed due to marketing issues)

   â¢ Uber Like Platform for Trucks (Freelance): Startup built in Isr
ael and discontinued during the lack of investment, my tasks was to build the front-end with React and the back-end with
 NestJS and GraphQL. Migrate the database to MongoDB and PostgreSQL. Implement real-time tracking for deliveries. Collab
orate to deliver the MVP on time and within budget. 

  â¢ Agency job (Full time job) : Worked in 2 agencies to deliver s
ome projects, my tasks was analyze client requirements, created technical designs, and developed web applications using 
React, NextJS, and NodeJS/ExpressJS. Integrated with Headless CMS platforms, collaborated with cross-functional teams to
 deliver projects on time and within budget.  

  
And here is my career, and i want to see if i'm qualified to get remo
te job or not, i hope i can receive any advice to improve my career during this month.

  
Thank you.

```
I have two backend services running, one is the application server and the runs the langchain agent service. I have a re
quirement where i need to ask for input from users from a web interface. The HumanInput tool currently works by getting 
input from the python terminal.  
How do I change it so that I can ask for input from the user in the web interface?

Th
e only approach I could come up with was to use websockets(supabase) and ask for input by sending this message from agen
t server to the frontend and the human input will be passed back to the agent server via the same socket channel.

Are t
here any other better ways to accomplish this?

Hi. I managed to create an agent using langgraph. Things work well if I run my code sending my user input to this agent.
   
However, what I need now is to have this langgraph based agent being used by another agent (my main agent running th
e system).   
Do anybody has any example on how to do that?  
I tried creating an structured tool that will call the fun
ction run\_graph that will invoke the graph but have had no success.

Hey folks ð! I've wrote a short guide on hot to use R`unnableBranch `for route to different prompts in LangChain.js 

[h
ttps://www.js-craft.io/blog/langchain-runnablebranch-javascript/](https://www.js-craft.io/blog/langchain-runnablebranch-

As a side note keep in mind  but in the future, using a [custom RunnableLambda router function ](https://w
ww.js-craft.io/blog/routing-langchain-js-different-prompts-based-on-query-type/)is the better way to do routing. More de
tails [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1dy26hp/will_runnablebranch_be_removed_from_future/). 

Neverth
eless, I think it's good to know aboutÂ `RunnableBranch`Â in case you see it in some codebase.

Hi all,

Soo, i have been working on a a projectcalled [GenAI Job Fit](https://github.com/DAVEinside/GenAI_Job_Fit). It'
s an AI-driven system designed to enhance job applications by providing tailored recommendations based on individual pro
files.

I'm relatively new to LangChain and LangGraph, and I've incorporated them into this project. I would greatly app
reciate it if you could check out the repository and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Your insights
 on how I can better implement LangChain/LangGraph, or any other aspect of the project, would be incredibly valuable. I'
m eager to learn and make this project as robust as possible.

Thank you in advance for your time and feedback!

```
[https://github.com/piEsposito/tiny-ai-client](https://github.com/piEsposito/tiny-ai-client)

The motivation for buildin
g tiny-ai-client comes from a frustration with Langchain, that became bloated, hard to use and poorly documented - and t
akes inspiraton from [simpleaichat](https://github.com/minimaxir/simpleaichat/tree/main), but adds support to vision, to
ols and more LLM providers aside from OpenAI (Gemini, Anthropic - with Groq and Mistral on the pipeline.)

I'm building 
this to to continue what simpleaichat started and not to ride on hype, raise money or whatever, but to help people do 2 
things: build AI apps as easily as possible and switching LLMs without needing to use Langchain.

This is a minimally vi
able version of the package, with support to vision, tools and async calls. There are a lot of improvements to be done, 
but even at its current state, tiny-ai-client has generally improved my interactions with LLMs and has been used in prod
uction with success.

Let me know what you think: there are still a few bugs that may need fixing, but all the examples 
work and are easy to be be adapted to your use case.
