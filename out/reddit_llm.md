I'm developing an application using a large language model (LLM) and am in need of a robust core agent platform that sup
ports multi-modal agent capabilities. Currently, I'm utilizing LLM for intent recognition and named entity recognition, 
and then I do backend workflow orchestration without LLM or Agents. My goal is to transition to an agent framework for e
nhanced flexibility. I'm looking for frameworks that are resilient against prompt injection and easier to with open-sour
ce LLMs. 

So far, I've considered:

1. LangChain Agents (I have experience with it)
2. LLaMaIndex Agents
3. HayStack Ag
ents
4. AutoGen

Do you:

1. Recommend any additional frameworks that are worth exploring for agent orchestration? 
2. H
ave a preferred framework in this context?
3. have experience with these framework and want to share feedback?

Most tutorials focused on enabling streaming
 with an OpenAI model, but I am using a local LLM (quantized Mistral) with llama.cpp. I think I have to modify the Callb

```
Hello friends, I know this post isn't as exciting as discussing the best porn model every week but I'd like recommendati
ons for a model tuned for legal writing or that has been trained on case law, legal briefs, that sort of thing. It shoul
d be more litigation focused, rather than transactional. Context size and comprehension are key. 

If there isn't anythi
ng that fits the bill, does anyone have a decent base model to recommend and maybe some comments or recommendations on h
ow to train a model? That's an area I haven't explored yet. My skill level is a beginner, so I've used Fiverr when I'm o
ut of my depth but I usually like to know enough to understand what I need and to clearly convey that to whoever I hire.
 I'm hoping you guys will help me get there. Estimates on time, manpower, processing power, and materials required would
 all be helpful to give me an idea of how far down the rabbit hole a project like this might send me.

By way of backgro
und, I'm an attorney that's been using ChatGPT since the beginning and I've since branched out to messing with vector da
tabases, Langchain, and hosting models locally. I have a 3090 but am open to renting better processing power if a model 
could give ChatGPT a run for its money. My use of ChatGPT can be fairly limited due to privacy concerns, attorney-client
 and work product privilege. The increase in context size has been great, but as has been discussed to death, ChatGPT's 
quality has gone down. It's legal writing is very poor, wordy, and unapproachable so while it occasionally strikes gold,
 it takes a lot of mining to get there.

Right now I'm using the [GitHubRepoLoader](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations

GitHub repository. This is not great for local development (because we don't have the latest data).

Would you load the

From my 8 years of experience i have learnt that in India, there are lot more job opening in Java as compared to lets sa
y python or javascript. I have always struggled to get my resume shortlisted since i never worked in Java. (But fortunat
ely may cards played out well) I am writing this out since market has started opening and a lot of jobs have started pop
ping requiring Java Developers.

So, If you are starting up as a software Engineer. Don't rely on fancy stuff like 'Writ
ing LLM pipelines using python langchain' or writing backend services in GoLang. Stick to the basics and **develop web a
pps in Java Spring or JSF**. Don't go with MongoDB or any NoSQL databases, **stick to SQL**.   


Also, I see a lot of p
eople **not** open to work on 'X' technology. Always be language agnostic. Even if you don't have experience. Its always
 good to say: 'I have my basics tightened up, I will be able to pick up 'X' technology quickly'.   


All the best guys!

```
Hi, I've been using agents with autogen and crew, and now langgraph, mostly for learning and small/mid scale programs.
T
he more I use them the more I'm confused about the purpose of the agent framework in general.

The scenarios I've tested
: read input, execute web search, summaries, return to user. Most other usecases also follow a sequential iteration of s
teps. 
For these usecases, there is no need to include any sort of agents, it can be done through normal python scripts.

Same goes for other usecases

I'm trying to think about what does agents let us do that we could not do with just scrip
ts with some logic. Sure, the LLM As OS is a fantastic idea, but in a production setting I'm sticking to my scripts rath
er than hoping the LLM will decide which tool to use everytime...

I'm interested to learn the actual usecases and poten
tial of using agents too execute tasks, so please do let me know

I am looking for some tools in the cloud that I can use to scale a particular use case for my company. We were working o
n a chatbot that involved using gpt 3.5 and langchain agents. Sine fine tuning was introduced later last year, we have q
uickly adapted to that and it worked wonders for our use case. 

Now, all the scripts I have created for data preparatio
n for fine tuning is in my local machine. We are looking to use some cloud based solutions to create and manage the trai
ning data. Now, if it were only one use case, I could simply use gcs buckets to store and version the data. But my boss 
wants me to scale for multiple use cases. 

Here's a scenario:

If there are 2 dozen generative AI use cases which invol
ves the usage of fine tuned model, how would I manage data for every use case. And if other team wants to utitlize some 
of the existing data from the existing use case, how could they easily identify where to look for and generate similar d
ata, etc. 

I'm not sure if I am able to define the problem correctly, but from what I understood is that my boss wants 
me to scale the current use case for multiple use cases with multiple datasets while managing the training data effectiv
ely so that its not a burden when someone wants to use the same data. 

I'm not sure which direction shall I head to in 
order to solve this problem. I'll be glad if someone can help me on this.

Hello Reddit Community,

I am currently working on a Document Information extractor project using LangChain within a Doc

or is as follows:

Error

    MaxRetryError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='openai.blob.core.windows.net', port=443): Max ret
ries exceeded with url: /embeddings/... (Caused by SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED

This error occurs at the followi
ng line of code:

Python code

    docsearch = FAISS.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings()) 

The Docker containe
r seems unable to verify the SSL certificate presented by the OpenAI server. I've ensured my internet connection is stab
le, and there are no issues with SSL certificates when running the code outside of Docker.

Has anyone encountered a sim

Kinda serious, kinda joking, but curious who else is using AI to save themselves from explaining trivial engineering pri

estions I get asked in business calls ( or the bad decisions that I need to shut down ) and ask the AI to explain why it
 is/isn't a good idea to do/not do this thing. The great part is at the end of the conversation I get to say, 'Look ladi
es and gentlemen, I am always open to discussion and improvement of ideas but AI is the one arguing against you not me. 
I am just relaying information.' Basically I am using AI as my bad cop in my good cop bad cop routine. Anyone else doing
 this?

After writing this I just realized some one needs to create an AI startup that just has it constantly listen to 
calls and be the jerk to shut down stupid stuff in real time. I am too lazy. Please build me this tool open source using
 Langchain. Should be super easy but not cost effective unless using local models.

Hi, I'm using Elasticsearch to maintain a set of documents. When a user types in a query, I perform a lexical (+semantic
) search and output the results. So far I've had good success with this approach. However, I now want to perform a post-

first-place?  
Thanks!

```
I'm working on embedding some documents (lots of it) and I was debugging my code, running it to check if the AzureOpenEm
beddingAPI works, here's the code:

        loader = DataFrameLoader(df, page_content_column='desc_cleaned')
    
      
  splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
            chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200
        )
        splits = s
plitter.split_documents(loader.load())
        vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=AzureOpen
AIEmbeddings(show_progress_bar=True))

So now I got my debugger on, and I'm trying to save the vector store so that I do
n't have to sit through the whole thing again, but doing \`vectorstore.persist()\` does not seem to work, and it does no
t throw an error either.

Do you guys have an idea on how I could save the store locally?

```
Hi, 

I wanted to find a more clean way to load my PDFs than PyPDF loader and came across [Unstructured.io](https://Unst
ructured.io) wit Langchain. I am loading my PDF like this: 

`# UnstructuredIO Test`  
`from langchain_community.documen
t_loaders import UnstructuredFileLoader`  
`loader = UnstructuredFileLoader(`  
 `'my.pdf', mode='elements'`  
`)`  
`do
cs = loader.load()`  
`docs[:5]`

Now I figured out that this loads every line of the PDF into a list entry (PDF with 22
 pages ended up with 580 entries). But how can I extract the text of whole pages to be able to further use it for RAG?


With only reading on one line each, I think context gets lost.

```
Hi,

I understand that Chunking for RAG is very important for longer texts. But I was wondering why it is common that PD
Fs also get chunked. 

For example, many PDF pages in my use case have less than 2000 characters. When reading in the PD
F, the context over pages gets lost anyways, because PyPDFLoader for example stores every page separately.  As 2000 char
s isn't that much and I want to get as many context as possible (so maximum 1 page), why should I consider chunking?

Hi folks

I'm currently trying to build an app (python) using local llms 
I tried Mistral 7b instruct. 
I have tried few
 prompts asking the model to generate code snippets and functions. But now i have to test the model if it can give sourc
e code to build an app (let's say a chatbot for instance). 
Basically the input would be a use case in natural language


For example: Build an end to end chatbot that can answer customer's queries and help with the issues.

What should be m
y approach ? How to get this done ? Please provide suggestions since I'm really new to LLMs. If possible provide any tut
orials or guides.

```
Hi,

in a RAG application, I am using FAISS as retriever:

`retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={'k': 3, 
'score_treshold': 0.9}, search_type='similarity')`

`retriever.get_relevant_documents('- I am Karl and I play soccer')`


However when changing the Score-Treshold I am still getting back the same documents. So there is no difference if I set
 it to 0.1 or 0.9.

In my understanding it should work as follows:

\- Search the top 3 docs that have a similarity scor
e of 0.9 or higher.

\- If for example only one doc has a higher similarity than 0.9, only retrieve one doc.

\- But: it
 is always retrieving 3 Docs, even if they are not similar

&#x200B;

Is this assumption correct or how can I make it wo
rk?

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Code vs JSON output for LLM agents? Frameworks like LangChain rely on LLMs responding with JSON  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/197f416/d_code_vs_json_output_for_llm_agents_frameworks/) , 2024-01-25-0910
```
[CaP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07753.pdf), [Voyager](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16291.pdf), [Octopus](https://arxiv.or
g/abs/2310.08588)

I work primarily with JSON based agents but code-as-policy agents seem to be extremely powerful. Here
 are some of the benefits and weaknesses I've seen

Pros of code

1. Less tool creation needed - The prebuilt math/file/
string/list manipulation abilities that come with code are enormous. In a JSON based agent, you would have to formally d
eclare each of these as a tool which you expose to the LLM and explain in your prompting, which is a lot of work and eat
s up a ton of the context window. 
2. Reduced number of transactions - The LLM can write scripts that invoke multiple to
ols and manipulate their results in ways that are difficult to do in a single transaction via JSON. For example, in one 
script, the model could search a DB 3 times, perform regex on the query results, convert them to integers, and add them 
up. Doing this in one step via JSON tool invocations is basically impossible. 
3. Less syntax errors - this might be tot
ally just vibe-based reasoning, but it really seems like LLMs have an easier time writing valid python than valid JSON, 
especially when you have lots of nested arguments in your methods.

Cons

1. Crazy risky - This is the obvious one. You 
have a machine executing random code. There are ways to mitigate this but still. I mean seriously we all learned not to 
use eval, so it is crazy to basically see research tending towards just running eval on the outputs of these models. 
2.
 Scripts with errors - Sometimes the model tries to get too fancy and writes complex programs that have bugs, resulting 
in many needed retries. 

Do any of you have thoughts or experience with these approaches in the wild? 

Is anybody awar
e of any experiments that compare these two approaches against each other?

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Are Custom LLM RAG apps going to become redundant? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1929n4f/d_are_custom_llm_rag_apps_going_to_become/) , 2024-01-25-0910
```
Loks like Copilot Studio is being rolled out (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio
) with an impressive looking no code/out of the box RAG solution.

There is a phenomenal amount of development and activ
ity in the Open Source RAG world (e.g Langchain, Llamaindex, etc), which I am a great supporter of FYI.

However, what s
eems strange is that this no code out of the box solution (Copilot Studio - just as an example of one) seems overwhelmin
gly to be the better option if you wanted to build a RAG app i.e If you compare the cost to build and productionise a cu
stom RAG app vs the cost of using Copilot Studio, it's almost an order of magnitude lower (no matter how you cut it with
 the developer time and duration). 

My question is, it seems to me we are moving towards a situation where enterprise s
olutions will make custom RAG apps redundant (not in all cases of course, but most cases), however there seems to be ver
y little discussion of this relative to the activity in the open source community. Do people agree this is a likely scen
ario? 

Obviously there will be exceptions…but on most use cases I don’t see how you can compete with an instant/minimal
 setup, low cost, highly scalable RAG solution.

From a corpus of text, how can you detect emerging topics and their evolution through time?

Introducing Temporal Augmen
ted Retrieval (TAR). (built in the context of buildspace n&w s4)

TAR is an open-source advanced RAG approach that aims 
to factor in the dynamic and temporal aspects of textual data when performing retrieval.

It allows us to understand the
 evolution of discussed topics over time.

The idea behind this project is to open the debate regarding the current limi
tations of RAG methods

This first approach has been built without using RAG frameworks (like Jerry Liu’s langchain) and
 focuses on financial tweets

ls like Mistral, LLAMA, Mixtral etc.

In my experience, I have been unable to get the Autogen+LocalLLM framework to iden
tify the right tools to use given the prompt. However it does a fantastic job with the GPT model. 

Please note that my 
goal is for the agent to mandatorily use the tools provided and not come up with its own code. And the agent should figu
re out the right tool to use. 

I have been very explicit with my prompting, despite which I am unable to get this to wo

Any thoughts and suggestions? Please let me know ! Please share your experiences as well. Cheers !

Hello everyone,

I'm embarking on a project to create a chatbot for my school's handbook, aiming to make it a resource f
or students to easily access information. As someone relatively new to AI, I'm seeking guidance on implementing this.

M
y current plan is to use OpenAI as the primary language learning model, focusing on affordability. I am considering inte
grating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and LangChain for enhanced functionality. However, I'm quite perplexed abou
t choosing an appropriate vector database, as many options appear costly. The goal is to keep this system live and acces
sible for student usage without breaking the bank.

I'm also looking into open-source embedding models to pair with the 
vector database. Pinecone has caught my attention, but its pricing seems steep for our budget.

Does anyone have recomme
ndations or tips on affordable yet effective tools and strategies for this project? Any insights on vector databases sui
table for educational use, or ways to optimize cost without compromising quality, would be greatly appreciated.

Thank y
ou in advance for your help!
