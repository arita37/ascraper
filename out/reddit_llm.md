Here is a description of how RAG structures are constructed: [https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/](https://
python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/) I now wonder: Does a CustomGPT already do this with the uploaded data? Or does
 it make sense to integrate such a RAG structure yourself?

Theoretically, it could also be that ChatGPT does not carry 
out this processing and simply checks which file could contain what is needed and adds it internally as a whole as the c
ontext of the request.

What would you guess is how it works in practice?

```
Hi fellow devs,

Does anyone know if there's an opensource tool with built for managing RAG document?

Imagine a drag-an
d-drop web interface for users to upload multiple documents.

Once uploaded, the system should:

1. Store the documents 
in some kind of storage (like S3, Blob Storage).
2. Trigger a pipeline to handle chunking and embedding generation.
3. I
nsert the processed data into a database (vector DB like Pinecone, Weaviate, or Postgres).

I already have a QA chatbot 
set up, so I don’t need any chat functionality like Ragflow, Onyx or Open Web UI just the document ingestion pipeline wi
th a user-friendly web UI.

I checked out Qdrant UI and Milvus Attu but they seem to have only data management functiona
lity not the ingestion pipeline.

Does anyone know of existing tools or frameworks that can do this, or am I better off 
building something custom?

Thanks!

```
I want to build a RAG using a lessons learned database with LangChain. The original Lessons Learned DB is a table, which
 I export as csv and then convert into a ChromaDB.

I merge each entry or row into a text blob, which I then try to tag 
with metadata such as ID, title and project. The text blob also has the column “Best Practice”, which can be true or fal
se.

If I start a query like: “Give me examples with good best practice”. Entries are also returned which are “Best Prat
ice: false”. This is probably because “Best Practice: true” and “Best Pratice: false” are very close to each other in th
e embedding.

Therefore, my idea would be to include the “Best Pratice” in the metadata.

Here is my question: Is the si
milarity search even carried out through the metadata? Or only through the page content? Is it possible to filter via th
e metadata with LangChain?

I currently use my RAG to get the relevant entries back like this:

    retriever = chroma_d
b.as_retriever(search_type='similarity_score_threshold',
                                       search_kwargs={'score_th
reshold': 0.2,

```
I've been experimenting with a mathematical axiom-based approach to prompt engineering that's yielding consistently stro
ng results across different LLM use cases. I'd love to share it with fellow prompt engineers and see how we can collecti
vely improve it.

Here's the base axiom structure:  
Axiom: max(OutputValue(response, context))  
subject to ∀element ∈ 
Response,  
(  
precision(element, P) ∧  
depth(element, D) ∧  
insight(element, I) ∧  
utility(element, U) ∧  
coherenc
e(element, C)  
)

Core Optimization Parameters:  
• P = f(accuracy, relevance, specificity)  
• D = g(comprehensiveness
, nuance, expertise)  
• I = h(novel\_perspectives, pattern\_recognition)  
• U = i(actionable\_value, practical\_applic
ation)  
• C = j(logical\_flow, structural\_integrity)

Implementation Vectors:

1. max(understanding\_depth) where comp
rehension = {context + intent + nuance}
2. max(response\_quality) where quality = { expertise\_level + insight\_generati
on + practical\_value + clarity\_of\_expression }
3. max(execution\_precision) where precision = { task\_alignment + det
ail\_optimization + format\_appropriateness }

Response Generation Protocol:

1. Context Analysis: - Decode explicit req
uirements - Infer implicit needs - Identify critical constraints - Map domain knowledge
2. Solution Architecture: - Stru
cture optimal approach - Select relevant frameworks - Configure response parameters - Design delivery format
3. Content 
Generation: - Deploy domain expertise - Apply critical analysis - Generate novel insights - Ensure practical utility
4. 
Quality Assurance: - Validate accuracy - Verify completeness - Ensure coherence - Optimize clarity

Output Requirements:
  
• Precise understanding demonstration  
• Comprehensive solution delivery  
• Actionable insights provision  
• Clear
 communication structure  
• Practical value emphasis

Execution Standards:  
\- Maintain highest expertise level  
\- E
nsure deep comprehension  
\- Provide actionable value  
\- Generate novel insights  
\- Optimize clarity and coherence


Terminal Condition:  
ResponseValue(output) ≥ max(possible\_solution\_quality)

Execute comprehensive response generati
on sequence.  
END AXIOM

What makes this interesting:

1. It's a systematic approach combining mathematical optimizatio
n principles with natural language directives
2. The axiom structure seems to help LLMs 'lock in' to expert-level respon
se patterns
3. It's producing notably consistent results across different models
4. The framework is highly adaptable - 
I've successfully used it for everything from viral content generation to technical documentation

I'd love to see:

* Y
our results testing this prompt structure
* Modifications you make to improve it
* Edge cases where it performs particul
arly well or poorly
* Your thoughts on why/how this approach affects LLM outputs

  
try this and see what your llm says
 id love to know 

'How would you interpret this axiom as a directive?

max(sum ∆ID(token, i | prompt, L))

subject to ∀
token ∈ Tokens, (context(token, C) ∧ structure(token, S) ∧ coherence(token, R))'

EDIT: Really enjoying the discussion a
nd decided to create a repo here [codedidit/axiomprompting](https://github.com/codedidit/axiomprompting) we can use to s
hare training data and optimizations. Im still setting it up if anyone wants to help!

```
I am currently learning LangChain and would like to build a RAG with Chroma. In the classic approach, you always get a f
ixed number of retrievals back (Top K).

With this approach, however, other important retrievals might not be considered
 or unimportant ones might be included in the context.

A flexible approach would be much better here. Simply specify a 
maximum number of retrievals, e.g. 5, and a semantic threshold above which they are selected.

If there is a lot of data
, the LLM gets more context; if there is no good data, perhaps only one. This also reduces the risk of hallucinating.

s there such an approach with LangChain and Chroma?

```
The number one reason LLM projects fail is the **quality of AI answers**. This is a far bigger issue than performance or
 latency.

Verifying the accuracy of LLM-generated answers, especially when working with private or enterprise data, is 
particularly challenging. It is not like fact-checking public information through a quick Google search. Verifying inter
nal data is harder, slower, and often not something users are motivated to do. If users don’t trust the answers, they’ll
 stop using the agent.

To address this, we built **Proving**—a tool that cryptographically proves the correctness of AI
-generated answers for private database queries.

Here’s how it works:

A user asks a natural language question. The too
l translates the question into SQL, runs the query, and returns the answer in natural language **along with a proof** th
at verifies:

* The SQL query it ran.
* That the query included all relevant data.

Currently, the tool supports Natural
 Language to SQL queries on PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite (yes we use Langchain!)

[Here’s a link to our blog for more d
etails.](https://provably.ai/blog/introducing-proving-a-technique-to-rapidly-verify-and-trust-ai-answers)

We’d love you
r feedback:

1. Would this kind of tool accelerate AI answer verification?
2. Could tools like this help reduce user anx
iety around trusting AI answers?
3. Are you using LLMs to query data? Would you like to explore whether this tool could 
help increase user trust?

Most of the agents I build for customers need some level of PDF Understanding to work. I spent a lot of time testing out
 different approaches and implementations before landing on one that seems to work well regardless of the file contents 
and infrastructure requirements.

tl;dr:

>What a number of LLM researchers have figured out over the last year is that 
vision models are actually really good at understanding images of documents. And it makes sense that some significant po
rtion of multi-modal LLM training data is images of pages of documents... the internet is full of them.  
So in addition
 to extracting the text, if we can also convert the document's pages to images then we can send BOTH to the LLM and get 
a much better understanding of the document's content.

```
Hi everyone,

I’m working on a semantic search project using HuggingFace models for text embedding and an LLM for answer
ing queries. Here’s the workflow:

User uploads documents (PDFs).
We process the documents, generate embeddings, and sto
re them in a vector database.
Users query the uploaded documents, and we return answers from the LLM.
Everything is func
tioning well except for one issue: sometimes the model doesn’t return the correct answer even though the information exi
sts in the uploaded documents.

I’ve tried:

Verifying the embedding quality.
Checking the vector database query configu
ration.
Ensuring the LLM receives the relevant context.
Despite this, the answers are occasionally off.

Possible reason
s I’ve considered:

Embedding model not capturing enough semantic nuance.
Improper chunking of the documents.
Retrieval 
pipeline not ranking relevant chunks accurately.
I’d love to hear your thoughts on:

Why this might be happening.
How I 
can improve accuracy and ensure the correct information is retrieved.
Any suggestions on improving embeddings, chunking 
strategies, or tweaking the retrieval setup would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

all -  [ How to Improve the Accuracy of RAG Search? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1hgv25q/how_to_improve_the_accuracy_of_rag_search/) , 2024-12-20-0913
```
I attempted to build a **multi-agent chatbot**, where one of the agents is called the **'knowledge searcher'**. This age
nt determines whether a `function_calling` is needed to retrieve related knowledge based on the user's query. The workin
g principle of the **knowledge searcher** is as follows:

1. When a `function_calling` is required, it retrieves content
 from predefined variables. Otherwise, it returns `None`.
2. It organizes the retrieved content into a summary of 200 wo
rds using an LLM.

The output of the **knowledge searcher** is then used as the input for the **final agent**.

## Why T
his Approach?

1. **Limited Data Volume**  
   The dataset is relatively small.
   
2. **Issues with Traditional RAG Tec
hniques**  
   Traditional RAG often returns irrelevant results or fails to retrieve essential data.  
   For example, w
hen my dataset contains specifications for computers `a`, `b`, and `c`, and the user asks, *'What are the specifications
 of computer a?'*, it often retrieves specifications for all three (`a`, `b`, and `c`). If this combined result is passe
d to the final agent, the prompt becomes overly complex, leading to degraded response quality.

## Question
However, whe
n I use this `function-calling` approach instead of vector search, I encounter some issues:

1. The chatbot response tim
e becomes slower.
2. Sometimes the user's query does not require accessing the knowledge base, yet it still triggers the
 function calling, even though I keep refining the prompt.

Therefore, I believe I ultimately need to return to using th
e RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) method. However, the challenges I face with RAG include 'frequently retrieving ir
relevant data' and 'failing to retrieve relevant data'. I'm unsure if there is something I am not handling well, such as
 document chunking or other processing steps.

Additionally, I’ve also tried using hybrid search (**BM25 + FAISS**), but
 the problem still lies in the document segmentation process. Since the current dataset is small, I can easily review th
e segmented document chunks. However, the same piece of information is often split into different chunks, and the search
 results only consider one part as relevant.

I’ve come across technologies like **Graph RAG**, but considering the cost
 and the fact that the dataset isn’t complex enough yet, I’d like to ask if anyone has suggestions that might be more su
itable for my situation.

## Prompts and Function Calls

### **Knowledge Searcher Prompt**
```python
knowledge_sear

# Knowledge Base
The current knowledge base includes:
1. samsung_computer_introduce: ....
2. .... 
...

# Too
ls 
Access the full content of the knowledge base using tools.
The names of the available tools and their related parame
ters are as follows:
{tool_names}

# Search Conditions
- **When a search is needed**:
   - The query involves specific p
roduct specifications, application cases, or integration methods.
   - The user explicitly asks for detailed information
 about a particular product.
   - Keywords in the query are highly relevant to the knowledge base content (e.g., 'comput
er resolution,' 'model selection').

- **When a search is not needed**:
   - The query is about general information (e.g
., product price, support methods) that cannot be mapped to the knowledge base.
   - The query is entirely unrelated to 
the knowledge base.
   - The query is too vague to determine specific needs.
   - The question has already been answered
 in the conversation and does not require further searching.

# Key Constraints
- When a query meets the 'search conditi
ons,' use the tool to retrieve related knowledge base content and summarize it in 200 words. (Do not answer the question
 directly.)
- If a search is not needed, return `None`.

```
Hey everybody! My team and I have been working on a foundational video language model (viFM) as-a-service we're excited 
to do our first release!

tl;dw is an API for video foundational models (viFMs) and provides video understanding. It hel
ps developers build apps powered by an AI that can watch and understand videos just like a human. 

  
Only search is av
ailable right now but these are all the features that will be releasing over the next few weeks:

* Semantic video searc
h: Use plain English to find specific moments in single or multiple videos
* Classification: Identify context-based acti
ons or behaviors
* Labeling: Add metadata or label every event
* Scene splitting: Automatically split videos into scenes
 based on what you’re looking for
* Video-to-text: Get text description of what is happening in the clip or video

  
Wh
at can you build with tl;dw?

* an AI agent that can recommend videos based on your preferences
* the internal media dis
covery platform [Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/building-a-media-understanding-platform-for-ml-innovations-9bef996
2dcb7) has
* smart home security camera like the demo we have [here](https://trytldw.ai/security_demo)
* find usable sho
ts if you’re producing a video
* automatically add metadata to videos or scenes

Any feedback is appreciated! Is there s
omething you’d like to see? Do you think this API is useful? How would you use it, etc. Happy to answer any questions as
 well.

```
So I tried out the MongoDB checkpointer implementation from [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/pers
istence_mongodb/), and while it does work great out of the box for storing graph state, I am running into some problems 
when trying to use it as a conversation store. Apparently, every time the state of the graph changes, a new checkpoint i
s written to the database  which contains all the messages in all the previous checkpoints, which I assume is implemente
d this way in order to enable time travelling. My question is first of all, is there a way to disable this or tune it in
 a way such that I store one document per conversation (thread\_id) in my db, which keeps updating instead of writing a 
new checkpoint every time. ( I assuming there is no way to do this currently, just want to know why  ) Secondly, is usin
g persistent DB checkpointers event a good way to store conversations? Or do people generally implement their own stores
? Let us say I wish to store multiple conversations and want to pull a single a conversation by given thread\_id. Someth
ing like storing the `created_at` attribute in the metadata, then sorting in descending order and picking the first chec
kpoint would work, but at this point I feel like I'm unnecessarily complicating stuff and should just go for a self made
 conversation store, especially as my requirements will become more complex.

Hi everyone,

I am using a React agent with LangGraph to orchestrate function calls to Azure OpenAI GPT-4o. My workflow 
involves the following:

1. Extract 30 questions from one tool.
2. Use a RAG tool to retrieve answers.

Since `parallel 
tool call = true`, the RAG tool hits all the questions in parallel. However, when I check the traces, I observe an unexp
ected pattern:

* It processes the first 10-12 calls, then pauses briefly.
* After the gap, it processes the next 10-12 
calls.

I don’t see any set limits on the function or parameters for the number of parallel calls. I’ve attached an imag
e of the trace for clarity. Does anyone have an idea why this might be happening? Could it be an internal limitation or 
bottleneck somewhere?

  
Here’s the trace image for reference:

Hey everyone, I would like to intro
duce you my latest repo, that is a local conversational rag on your files, Be honest, you can use this as a rag on-premi
ses, cause it is build with docker, langchain, ollama, fastapi, hf All models download automatically, soon I'll add an a
bility to choose a model For now solution contains:

* Locally running Ollama (currently qwen-0.5b model hardcoded, soon
 you'll be able to choose a model from ollama registry)
* Local indexing (using sentence-transformer embedding model, yo
u can switch to other model, but only sentence-transformers applied, also will be changed soon)
* Qdrant container runni
ng on your machine
* Reranker running locally (BAAI/bge-reranker-base currently hardcoded, but i will also add an abilit
y to choose a reranker)
* Websocket based chat with saving history
* Simple chat UI written with React
* As a plus, you 
can use local rag with ChatGPT as a custom GPT, so you able to query your local data through official chatgpt web and ma
c os/ios app.
* You can deploy it as a RAG on-premises, all containers can work on CPU machines

Couple of ideas/problem
s:

* Model Context Protocol support
* Right now there is no incremental indexing or reindexing
* No selection for the m
odels (will be added soon)
* Different environment support (cuda, mps, custom npu's)
