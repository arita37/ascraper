I'm looking into LangChain to power search on some inventory. I would like to get parameters for this search from the de
scription to serve the customer. However, the customer should be able to ask his search query in any possible way, but o
bviously the API in the backend can support only a limited set of inputs.   


Exactly how would this work? And what too
ls should I consider? The idea is not to provide a response in the chat, but to provide it like an inventory search.

is setting max tokens(input+output) to **2048** although the maximum number of allowed tokens for Llama2 is **4092**, is
 the reason that long (inputs, outputs) pairs may need a bigger GPU? or I am missing something here.

I recreated
 this with my own API and yaml. I keep hitting the token limit because it feeds the entire yaml for reference. My tokens
 are 71k, just about the size of the one in the documentation. 

I would think the agent would use the documention as a 
resource, but not in sending the entire request. Maybe I'm not understanding this correctly, can someone please explain 
this to me? 

I get everything to run with all the authentication, but I keep hitting the token limit. What should I do?

```
Hey  all. To build truly useful GenAI apps, LLMs need to be able to access  propriety data from structured and unstructu
red data sources. LLMs  struggle to understand the availability, location, and methods to  retrieve relevant data.

Key 
problems:

1. LLMs can’t identify if the necessary data is available to answer a user query in any of the data sources.

2. If the data is available, LLMs can’t locate which data source to retrieve from.
3. If  the source is known, writing r
etrieval pipelines  (text-to-SQL, text-to-Cypher, text-to-JSON, etc.) for the numerous retrieval protocols is complicate
d, repetitive, and non-deterministic.

Some suggest fine-tuning or RAG as potential solutions but:

1. Fine-tuning  mode
ls with specific data is expensive, becomes outdated with the  latest data, and has in-built access control issues. Cont
inuous  retraining is costly and doesn’t keep pace with real-time data changes.
2. RAG  doesn’t work with structured dat
a. Most useful data is structured and  can be spread across numerous data sources, each with its own querying  mechanism
.
3. Writing individual retrieval pipelines are limited and complicated and don’t ensure determinism, security, and acce
ss control.

Have  you faced these issues in your projects? What workarounds or solutions  have you found effective? Any
 new tools or practices that simplify  integrating LLMs with diverse data sources?

Hi,

I am using LlamaCpp and saw different names for the maximum tokens parameter.

To set the maximum tokens, do I have
 to set a value to max\_tokens or to max\_new\_tokens? What is the difference here?

&#x200B;

Also if someone has bette
r experience with some parameters (specifically for RAG) feel free to suggest them. I am using these:

`llm = LlamaCpp(`

```
Is there a consensus in terms of the quality of the AI response, between keeping the chat history in the memory as is, o
r summarizing it using ConversationSummaryMemory? 

I understand that summarizing past messages will lead to fewer token
s being used, but does it also lead to a drop in the quality of the AI answer in an RAG model, considering that the summ
ary may not necessarily include all the facts of the past messages? 

Common sense would say that yes, that may lead to 
worse answers, but wondering how the community feels about this topic.

```
Hey LocalLLaMA,

\[EDIT\] - thanks for all the awesome additions and feedback everyone! I'm going to go through them, tr
y them out, and add them to my blog post. It's gonna take some time though since I need to try them first, and maybe cha
nge my conclusions a bit.

I reviewed [ten different ways to run LLMs locally](https://matilabs.ai/2024/02/07/10-ways-to
-run-llms-locally-and-which-one-works-best-for-you/), and compared the different tools. Many of the tools had been share
d right here on this sub. Here are the tools I tried:

&#x200B;

1. Ollama
2. 🤗 Transformers
3. Langchain
4. llama.cpp
5
. GPT4All
6. LM Studio
7. jan.ai
8. llm ([https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/) \- l
ink if hard to google)
9. h2oGPT
10. localllm

My quick conclusions:

* If you are looking to develop an AI application,
 and you have a Mac or Linux machine, **Ollama** is great because it's very easy to set up, easy to work with, and fast.

* If you are looking to chat locally with documents, **GPT4All** is the best out of the box solution that is also easy 
to set up
* If you are looking for advanced control and insight into neural networks and machine learning, as well as th
e widest range of model support, you should try **transformers**
* In terms of speed, I think **Ollama** or **llama.cpp*
* are both very fast
* If you are looking to work with a CLI tool, **llm** is clean and easy to set up
* If you want to 
use Google Cloud, you should look into **localllm**

I found that different tools are intended for different purposes, s
o I summarized how they differ into a table:

all -  [ RAG Accuracy ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1alus6s/rag_accuracy/) , 2024-02-12-0910
```
I am creating a RAG program where I used 20 pdfs which contains lease agreement of different tenants.

I am using langch
ain framework to work with FAISS and openAI Embeddings.

I am using  `text-embedding-ada-002` model because I think lang
chain currently does not support v3 embedding models. I get this error while using v3 models: `model not found. Using cl
100k_base encoding.`

Here's my process:

\- I read the directory containing pdfs (Some pdf are image based, some are te
xtual).

\- I use `from unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf` to extract data based on title. Below id code b
lock:

    raw_pdf_elements = partition_pdf(filename=pdf_path,
                # Unstructured first finds embedded image
 blocks
                extract_images_in_pdf=True,
                #Use layout model (YOLOX) to get bounding boxes (for
 tables) and find titles
                # Titles are any sub-section of the document
                infer_table_struct
ure=True,
                
                # Post processing to aggregate text once we have the title
                ch
unking_strategy='by_title',
                
                # Chunking params to aggregate text blocks
                
# Attempt to create a new chunk 3800 chars
                # Attempt to keep chunks > 2000 chars
                max_cha
racters=4000,
                new_after_n_chars=3800,
                combine_text_under_n_chars=2000,
                i
mage_output_dir_path=path
                )

\- Then I create documents from the extracted text along with the tenant na
me in metadata (To get information from specific tenant's lease agreement when I mention it's name in the question). 1 p
df at a time.

\- After I get document chunks from all pdfs, I create list of all the chunks.

\- I create FAISS index f
or that data.

\- Then I perform QnA.

&#x200B;

The problem is the accuracy I get from this is very low. For most of th
e question, semantic search cannot even find relevant context.

I want to know if the accuracy of RAG is generally lower
 than the expectations or am I doing something wrong?

What process do you follow for better results?

I've tried things like langchain in the past (6-8 months ago) but they were cumbersome and didn't work as expected.

I  
need RAG to get data from various pdfs (long one, 150+ pages) - and i  need a setup that will allow me to add more and m
ore data sources.

I wanna run this locally, can get a 24gb video card (or 2x16gb ones) - so i can run using 33b or smal
ler models.

I  know things in the industry change every 2 weeks, so i'm hoping there's  an easy and efficient way of do
ing RAG (compared to 6 months ago)

Hey Reddit, I've been applying for jobs and found that writing a cover letter for each position was tedious. I also delv

 the GPL license. While it's far from perfect, it has proven very useful to me, and I hope it benefits you as well. All 
I have to do is provide it with a pdf containing information about me such as my experience, skills, projects, etc and i
t will use this information along with job description to generate cover letter for me. Since I'm new to ML and LLM, any
 advice or feedback is greatly appreciated, and contributions are also welcome. I plan to utilize Llama-2 soon to furthe

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Code vs JSON output for LLM agents? Frameworks like LangChain rely on LLMs responding with JSON  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/197f416/d_code_vs_json_output_for_llm_agents_frameworks/) , 2024-02-12-0910
```
[CaP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07753.pdf), [Voyager](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16291.pdf), [Octopus](https://arxiv.or
g/abs/2310.08588)

I work primarily with JSON based agents but code-as-policy agents seem to be extremely powerful. Here
 are some of the benefits and weaknesses I've seen

Pros of code

1. Less tool creation needed - The prebuilt math/file/
string/list manipulation abilities that come with code are enormous. In a JSON based agent, you would have to formally d
eclare each of these as a tool which you expose to the LLM and explain in your prompting, which is a lot of work and eat
s up a ton of the context window. 
2. Reduced number of transactions - The LLM can write scripts that invoke multiple to
ols and manipulate their results in ways that are difficult to do in a single transaction via JSON. For example, in one 
script, the model could search a DB 3 times, perform regex on the query results, convert them to integers, and add them 
up. Doing this in one step via JSON tool invocations is basically impossible. 
3. Less syntax errors - this might be tot
ally just vibe-based reasoning, but it really seems like LLMs have an easier time writing valid python than valid JSON, 
especially when you have lots of nested arguments in your methods.

Cons

1. Crazy risky - This is the obvious one. You 
have a machine executing random code. There are ways to mitigate this but still. I mean seriously we all learned not to 
use eval, so it is crazy to basically see research tending towards just running eval on the outputs of these models. 
2.
 Scripts with errors - Sometimes the model tries to get too fancy and writes complex programs that have bugs, resulting 
in many needed retries. 

Do any of you have thoughts or experience with these approaches in the wild? 

Is anybody awar
e of any experiments that compare these two approaches against each other?

deeplearning -  [ DSPy Explained! ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1adypks/dspy_explained/) , 2024-02-12-0910
```
DSPy is the next big advancement for AI and building applications with LLMs!

Pioneered by frameworks such as LangChain 
and LlamaIndex, we can build much more powerful systems by chaining together LLM calls! This means that the output of on
e call to an LLM is the input to the next, and so on. We can think of chains as programs, with each LLM call analogous t
o a function that takes text as input and produces text as output.

DSPy offers a new programming model, inspired by PyT
orch, that gives you a massive amount of control over these LLM programs. Further the Signature abstraction wraps prompt
s and structured input / outputs to clean up LLM program codebases.

DSPy then pairs the syntax with a super novel compi
ler that jointly optimizes the instructions for each component of an LLM program, as well as sourcing examples of the ta
sk.

Here is my review of the ideas in DSPy, covering the core concepts and walking through the introduction notebooks s
howing how to compile a simple retrieve-then-read RAG program, as well as a more advanced Multi-Hop RAG program where yo
u have 2 LLM components to be optimized with the DSPy compiler! I hope you find it useful!
