Hey all!

I've made the world's largest ai agent directory. 

The agent market is so scrappy at the moment and very diff
icult to find the right agent for the job. 

Agent Locker makes it as easy as possible to filter agents by category, use
 case, integration method and price and you can also specify agentic, ai tools and agent platforms. 

There's over 1000 
ai listings already and we're growing everyday.

Hope you find it useful.

```
I'm an SE with 10 years of experience and no degree, and I'm acutely aware of the need to be adaptable with the given di
rection of AI, but I'm struggling to understand the different possible paths to take.

Assuming we don't hit a level of 
AI which replaces *ALL* jobs yet, I figure the most useful path I can take is to strengthen high level SE skills, e.g. s
ystem architecture and design, as well as being au fait with AI integrations, e.g. using libraries like Langchain to bui
ld RAG systems, being able to use vector DBs etc.

Once I've got those basics down, I want to transition diagonally into
 a field that's at least somewhat robust to changes, e.g. ML engineer, MLops, etc. Other options I have wondered about a
re things like robotics or cyber security, which are both fields I assume will become more necessary given the presumed 
trajectory of AI. 

I think ideally I'd go into an ML engineer/MLops role, assuming the day to day looks roughly like de
veloping, finetuning, evaluating and deploying models, or just creating novels things.

The issue I'm having is understa
nding what's actually expected of those roles, as AI engineer / ML engineer seems to mean 100 different things, with som
e companies are expecting PhDs and others are expecting SEs who can use OpenAI APIs. And in general I'd just quite like 
to hear people's thoughts on what career paths people think are useful to aim for, have the best chance of sticking arou
nd for a few years, think are feasible, what skills to aim for which will generally be useful, etc.

Any and all thought
s welcome

all -  [ A rant about LangChain, and a minimalist alternative ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1hknn5a/a_rant_about_langchain_and_a_minimalist/) , 2024-12-24-0913
```
So, one of the questions I had on [my GitHub project](https://github.com/BrainBlend-AI/atomic-agents) was:

>Why we need
 this framework ?

>I’m trying to get a better understanding of this framework and was hoping you could help because the
 openai API also offer structured outputs?

>Since LangChain also supports input/output schemas with validation, what ma
kes this tool different or more valuable?

>I am asking because all trainings they are teaching langchain library to new
 developers . I’d really appreciate your insights—thanks so much for your time!

And, I figured the answer to this might
 be useful to some of you other fine folk here, it did turn into a bit of a rant, but here we go (beware, strong opinion
s follow):

Let me start by saying that I think it is wrong to start with learning or teaching *any* framework if you do
n't know how to do things without the framework. In this case, you should learn how to use the API on its own first—lear
n what different techniques are on their own and how to implement them, like RAG, ReACT, Chain-of-Thought, etc.—so you c
an actually understand what value a framework or library does (or doesn’t) bring to the table.

Now, as a developer with
 15 years of experience, knowing people are being taught to use LangChain straight out of the gate *really* makes me sad
, because—let’s be honest—it’s objectively not a good choice, and I’ve met a lot of folks who can corroborate this.

Per
sonally, I took a year off between clients to figure out what I could use to deliver AI projects in the fastest way poss
ible, while still sticking to my principle of *only* delivering high-quality and maintainable code.

And the sad truth i
s that out of everything I tried, LangChain might be the *worst* possible choice—while somehow also being the most popul
ar. Common complaints on reddit and from my personal convos with devs & teamleads/CTOs are:

* Unnecessary abstractions

* The same feature being done in three different ways
* Hard to customize
* Hard to maintain (things break often between
 updates)

Personally, I took more than one deep-dive into its code-base and from the perspective of someone who has bee
n coding for 15+ years, it is pretty horrendous in terms of programming patterns, best practices, etc... All things that
 should be **AT THE ABSOLUTE FOREFRONT of anything that is made for other developers!**

**So, why is LangChain so popul
ar?** Because it’s not just an open-source library, it’s a company with a CEO, investors, venture capital, etc. They too
k something that was never really built for the long-term and blew it up. Then they integrated every single prompt-engin
eering paper (ReACT, CoT, and so on) rather than just providing the tools to let you build your own approach. In reality
, each method can be tweaked in hundreds of ways that the library just doesn’t allow you to do (easily).

Their core bus
iness is not providing you with the best developer experience or the most maintainable code; it’s about partnerships wit
h every vector DB and search company (and hooking up with educators, too). That’s the only real reason people keep getti
ng into LangChain: it’s just really popular.

**The Minimalist Alternative: Atomic Agents**  
You don’t *need* to use At
omic Agents (heck, it might not even be the right fit for your use case), but here’s *why* I built it and made it open-s
ource:

1. I started out using the OpenAI API directly.
2. I wanted structured output and not have to parse JSON manuall
y, so I found “Guidance.” But after its API changed, I discovered “Instructor,” and I liked it more.
3. With Instructor,
 I could easily switch to other language models or providers (Claude, Groq, etc.) without heavy rewrites, and it has a b
uilt-in retry mechanism.
4. The missing piece was a consistent way to build AI applications—something minimalistic, lett
ing me experiment quickly but still have maintainable, production-quality code.

After trying out LangChain, crewai, aut
ogen, langgraph, flowise, and so forth, I just kept coming back to a simpler approach. Eventually, after several rewrite
s, I ended up with what I now call Atomic Agents. Multiple companies have approached me about it as an alternative to La
ngChain, and I’m currently helping a client rewrite their codebase from LangChain to Atomic Agents because their CTO has
 the same maintainability concerns I did.

**So why do you need Atomic Agents?** If you want the benefits of Instructor,
 coupled with a minimalist organizational layer that lets you experiment freely and still deliver production-grade code,
 then try it out. If you’re happy building from scratch, do that. The point is you *understand* the techniques first, an
d then pick your tools.

```
I use LangChain with tools to query yfinance, then use a local LLM model to generate answers. I found that those local L
LMs I have tried cannot answer simple questions such as 'What is Nike's address?'. OpenAI's gpt-4o model works correctly
. Even gpt-4o-mini works correctly too.

What local LLM model should I try next? I have tried the following: llama3.2:3b
, qwen2.5, granite3.1, qwen2.5-coder, mistral-nemo, and qwq. I found that phi3 and gemma2 do not work with tools.

  
No
te that these local LLMs can answer more complicated questions through tools' responses, such as 'who are the top 3 mutu
al fund holders of Nike?' They just cannot answer simple questions like 'What's Nike HQ's address?', 'What's Nike HQ's p
hone number?', etc.

The tool code I used is as follows:

    @tool
    def company_information(ticker: str) -> dict:
  
      '''Use this tool to retrieve company information like address, industry, sector, company officers, business summar
y, website,
           marketCap, current price, ebitda, total debt, total revenue, debt-to-equity, etc.'''
        
   
     ticker_obj = yf.Ticker(ticker)
        ticker_info = ticker_obj.get_info()
    
        return ticker_info
    
   
 @tool
    def last_dividend_and_earnings_date(ticker: str) -> dict:
        '''
        Use this tool to retrieve compa
ny's last dividend date and earnings release dates.
        It does not provide information about historical dividend yi
elds.
        '''
        ticker_obj = yf.Ticker(ticker)
        
        return ticker_obj.get_calendar()
    
    @too
l
    def summary_of_mutual_fund_holders(ticker: str) -> dict:
        '''
        Use this tool to retrieve company's t
op mutual fund holders. 
        It also returns their percentage of share, stock count and value of holdings.
        '
''
        ticker_obj = yf.Ticker(ticker)
        mf_holders = ticker_obj.get_mutualfund_holders()
        
        retu
rn mf_holders.to_dict(orient='records')
    ...

Gpt-4o correctly finds the address from yf.Ticker(ticker).get\_info(). 
But those local LLMs are not able to find the address from the returned data.

```
I am using Langchain's Pandas Dataframe Agent to create an AI Agent.

I provide it with a dataset and I prompted it with
 'Analyze this dataset and provide me with a response that is in one concise sentence.'

The LLM is outputting seemingly
 fine sentences, but I am sometimes getting this error:

>ValueError: An output parsing error occurred. In order to pass
 this error back to the agent and have it try again, pass \`handle\_parsing\_errors=True\` to the AgentExecutor.

But, w
hen I add 'handle\_parsing\_errors = True' into the create\_pandas\_dataframe\_agent then I get this error message:

>Us
erWarning: Received additional kwargs {'handle\_parsing\_errors': True} which are no longer supported.

It seems like th
e 'handling\_parsing\_errors' used to be a solution last year, but it doesn't work anymore.

I also tried to improve my 
prompt by adding 'you must always return a response in a valid format. Do not return any additional text' which helped, 
but it's not perfect.   
  
Is there a better way to handle the responses that the LLM returns?

I wanted to be able to generate full stories that maintain consistency throughout. Initially I used Gemini - it was good

It's in managed rollout right now - 
you can download it at [https://github.com/LotusSerene/scrollwise-ai](https://github.com/LotusSerene/scrollwise-ai) (you
'll need a Gemini API key). Approval is quick! 

What's Next: Honestly? I'm just releasing this into the wild to see how
 it goes. After days of anxiety about making everything perfect (and realizing perfect is the enemy of good), I decided 
to just go for it. I'm really just doing this for the fun of it.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback! This is j

I'm building a RAG solution for which I need to load PDF files from an AWS S3 bucket. I'm loading the entire file all at
 once and then passing it to pdfplumber for parsing the data. While this works for smaller PDFs, I've read that larger f
iles need to be streamed from S3 instead of loading all at once. I tried streaming the PDF file from S3 but unfortunatel
y, the pdfplumber package does not work on a streaming object.

I want to know what is the correct (industry standard) w

Hey guys I managed to build a RAG agent with langgraph and now wish to serve it through a backend onto a frontend. I loo
ked up and found Chainlit as a framework for serving chatbot agents. Has anyone here used chainlit in production before?
 The langgraph integration was quite easy to do which is nice however for everything else it seems quite limiting in my 
use case. I wish to send JSON objects from the backend over to my frontend however currently it only allows sending stri
ng messages from the backend afaik. Also has very limited components out of the box and not very customizable. Does anyo
ne have any better options or should I just suck it up, create my own backend and frontend from scratch?

Ciao a tutti,  
sono un M29 e attualmente lavoro in una multinazionale italiana dove ho la possibilità di partecipare a 
progetti interessanti in ambito software engineering e machine learning. Ho una grande passione per la tecnologia e l’in
telligenza artificiale, e il mio obiettivo, nei prossimi anni, è crescere professionalmente per diventare un ML Architec
t o una figura simile. Mi piacerebbe raggiungere un livello tale da poter ambire a posizioni in aziende di spessore Tech
 pur restando in Italia (tipo le FANG, ma so che in Italia c'è poco e niente e il remote sta finendo)

**Un po' di backg
round su di me:**  
Lavoro da 3 anni nel campo, sono un ingegnere ma non un ingegnere informatico. Ho studiato AI all’un
iversità e completato un master universitario in AI e Machine Learning, mentre il resto delle mie competenze l’ho svilup
pate da autodidatta, lavorando su progetti reali e sperimentando per conto mio. Questo approccio mi ha dato una buona ve
rsatilità tecnica, ma spesso il dover imparare tutto di fretta mi rende un po’ dipendente da ChatGPT per colmare le lacu
ne e andare veloce.

**Le mie skill attuali includono:**

* **Linguaggi e framework principali:** Python (con focus su M
L e AI), C# [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET), React (JS e TS).
* **ML e AI:** Familiarità con MLOps (Mlflow, Kubeflow, Rayserve
, BentoML), AutoML, e librerie NLP come Haystack, Langchain e vLLM.
* **Cloud & Container:** Esperienza con Docker, K8S.

* **Database:** Uso avanzato di database relazionali e non (PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch).
* **Extra:** Interes
se per la Responsible AI e buone basi di ETL.

**Cosa vorrei migliorare:**

1. **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Voglio 
finalmente approfondire seriamente le basi di strutture dati e algoritmi, argomento che so essere cruciale per ruoli più
 avanzati e per affrontare interviste tecniche di alto livello.
2. **LeetCode e coding challenges:** Sto pianificando di
 iniziare a esercitarmi su LeetCode o piattaforme simili, ma non so bene come strutturare l’approccio. Consigli su come 
iniziare o piani di studio?
3. **ML System Design:** Vorrei imparare come progettare sistemi ML su larga scala, approfon
dendo argomenti come deployment, monitoring e ottimizzazione di sistemi distribuiti.

**Cosa sto cercando:**

1. Consigl
i pratici su come migliorare tecnicamente per diventare ML Architect: best practice di design, gestione di progetti comp
lessi, capacità di leadership tecnica.
2. Risorse utili per approfondire data structures, algoritmi e ML system design: 
libri, corsi, tutorial, paper, qualsiasi cosa che mi aiuti a crescere.
3. Opinioni su corsi universitari o certificazion
i: vale la pena seguire corsi specialistici online o magari un secondo master?
4. Suggerimenti su come strutturare il mi
o apprendimento per bilanciare lo studio teorico con la pratica.
5. Idee su come costruire un profilo competitivo per az
iende di livello FANG, anche restando in Italia.

Sono molto motivato a fare il salto di qualità e a imparare tutto quel
lo che serve per arrivare a questi obiettivi. Ogni consiglio o spunto sarà davvero apprezzato! 😊

**NB:** so che i *full
 stack* forse non esistono, so che il mondo a cui punto è molto complesso, so di *non sapere.*   
Help Me :)

```
My friend came up with a process to uncover limiting beliefs.  I'm curious if an AI chat bot / LLM could be trained to d
o this automatically.

The whole process is described here

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QoGyrJD35UURjNWpj3bFwdE
Ew8xrkAuyD8-EOtrY0qs/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.2l4ugw4t64m3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QoGyrJD35UURjNWpj3bFwdEEw8
xrkAuyD8-EOtrY0qs/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.2l4ugw4t64m3)

FIrst you identify an area you want to work on / transform (care
er, relationships, money, etc.)

Then you come up with a handful of 'I'm afraid' statements.

Example:

I'm afraid that 
I'll be a failure, I'm afraid that people will reject me, etc.

Once you have a few of those listed, you look at the hid
den assumptions behind those fears, and what those fears presuppose to be true.

After you uncover the hidden assumption
s, you come up with a belief statement that summarizes everything.

How could him or I make an AI bot / LLM to automate 
this process?

Meaning, type in the area of life we'd like transform (work, relationship, money, spiritual, etc.)  Then 
the AI would prompt us to type a few 'I'm afraid' statements.

Afterwards, the AI bot / LLM would hopefully ask us quest
ions to identify the hidden assumptions behind each individual 'I'm afraid' statement.

Here are the hidden assumptions,
 with a description of each.

* **Necessity:** What are the “have to’s,” “have to *not*’s,” “must’s,” “need to’s,” or “s
hould’s”? Do these fears assume you lack choice or have to force yourself to do something? What are the unquestioned rul
es or “duties”?  
* **Impossibility:** What do these fears presuppose is impossible? What are the “can’t’s” and “couldn’
t’s,” the “it-would-never-work’s”?  
* **Authority:** What do these fears presuppose you don’t have *permission* or *aut
hority* to do? What would be too taboo to even consider doing? What are the “may not’s” the “not OKs”? The things that w
ould lead to ridicule, criticism, or being “canceled”?  
* **Future / Change:** Do these fears presuppose the future wil
l necessarily be the same or worse than the present? What do these fears assume is *unchanging*?  
* **Chunk size:** Do 
these fears assume you have to do everything, all at once? Or that you can take it bit by bit?  
* **Speed:** Is there a
n assumption that things *must* happen quickly? That you can’t go at a reasonable pace?  
* **Joy:** Is there a hidden a
ssumption that the path to where you want to go will be miserable? That there’s no way to enjoy the journey?  
* **Cost 
of Failure:** Is there an assumption there’s only one chance to get it right? That failure is permanent? Or that you hav
e lots of chances, and failure is no big deal because that’s the way you learn?  
* **Deletions:** Are these fears delet
ing most – or all – of your resources, strengths, and past successes? When in the grips of these fears, do you find it d
ifficult to even remember what your strengths and past successes are?  
* **Others:** Do these fears presuppose you are 
alone in this, have to do it yourself, or that you don’t have support? That you are the only one who has ever dealt with
 this, and no one has ever succeeded at it, and no one would help you to succeed either?  
* **World:** What do these fe
ars presuppose about the external world? That it’s a wonderful, helpful, kind place, or a dystopian nightmare full of gr
eedy, selfish people?  
* **Universe / God:** From the perspective of these fears, what’s the relationship to The Univer
se or God or something equivalent? Is this dimension absent entirely? Is God “punishing you”? Are you experiencing “bad 
karma”? Are you forgetting your connection to the whole, the Oneness that pervades all things?

I took an NLP course this semester where I'm working on a project to build a restaurant reservation chatbot. The chatbot

I decided to go with Google’s Dialogflow API as it seemed to fit the use case well but my professor wanted me to exp
lore alternative approaches. I've started working with Llama using LangChain and implemented basic chatbot functionality
 using AIMessage and HumanMessage, and setting the prompt but I'm having trouble figuring out how to handle the database

```
Today, I came across a common question on Reddit and shared my response. I'm posting it here to reach a broader audience
, as I believe many beginners have similar questions.

*Question on* r/LLMDev *subreddit:*

>Hello, I'm making a project
 where every user has 10k input tokens and 400 output tokens worth of interaction at least 200 times a month. The projec
t is for general use(Like general knowledge question, or generating mathematical questions). Basically, it won't be much
 related to programming so IK Claude isn't the best option.

\[Read on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comment
s/1hepy6n/comment/m2720rl/)\]

*My response:*

To approach this systematically, we can evaluate the options across three
 key dimensions:

https://preview.redd.it/hth5pzz0h88e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=d61b2e6ad25ebbf7f529bbaafa
10dad300e0a543

**Dimension 1: Model Complexity**

For your use case—handling general knowledge queries and generating m
athematical questions—domain-specific expertise isn’t required. Any general-purpose LLM with 7B-13B parameters should su
ffice. Models like GPT-4 (by OpenAI), or similar alternatives from providers such as Cohere, Anthropic (Claude), or Mist
ral could work. In general, larger models (e.g., 27B or 70B) often provide higher-quality results but come at increased 
costs. The question you should be asking is if you REALLY need the best performing model (e.g., 70B)? Let's dive a bit d
eeper by thinking about quality.

**Dimension 2: Quality**

Quality depends on your project’s specific needs. If precise
 and nuanced answers are essential, GPT-4 or Claude might be better choices, but they cost more. If you can tolerate sli
ghtly less sophistication, models like Llama 3 (no offense to LLaMMA fans :-) ) or other open source models such as Falc
on provide good performance at a lower cost, especially when hosted locally or through cost-efficient APIs.

Bottom line
 is that while smaller models (7B-13B) are cost-effective, larger models tend to produce higher-quality, nuanced outputs
. It’s a good idea to experiment with smaller models first to determine if they meet your quality requirements. They off
er the advantages of lower costs and better latency, making them a practical starting point.'

**Dimension 3: Cost**

Co
st plays a pivotal role in API/LLM selection.

Let's estimate cost of using different LLM available as a service - based
 on your requirements:

Input tokens = 10k

Output tokens = 400

Number of calls = 200

**NOTE:**

* Do your own price c
alculation - I don't know about the accuracy of the [website](https://gptforwork.com/tools/openai-chatgpt-api-pricing-ca
lculator) I used for generating these comparative pricing.
* Multiple cost x (number of users)
* Don't forget to factor 
in the development/QA cost
* Self hosted LLMs will require infrastructure which by the way is not cheap :-)

https://pre
view.redd.it/ahp8h49qg88e1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=9124d97dd6b325f4ea369924b1c76cf31c094ef3

In your parti
cular scenario, the cost is relatively low, so I’d recommend going for the best option. 😊

That said, keep in mind that 
costs for real-world applications can be significantly higher. To provide a complete picture, here are some suggestions 
for cost optimization

*Cost-Optimization Tips*

Here are some strategies to reduce costs without compromising too much 
on quality:

1. **Fine-tune smaller models:** Train a smaller model to specialize in your specific queries.
2. **Hybrid 
approach:** Use larger models only for complex queries while leveraging smaller ones for routine tasks.
3. **Context opt
imization:** Use vector databases (e.g., Pinecone) with LangChain to minimize input token usage by feeding only relevant
 data to the model.

**My 2 Cents**

If you’re new to the world of LLMs, making these decisions can be daunting. A struc
tured course on LLMs can help you navigate these options more effectively and avoid common pitfalls. If you’re intereste
d, check out my course designed specifically for beginners—it provides actionable guidance and helps you get up to speed
 quickly.

isn't scalable, I have never made projects for scale involving databases and deployment and async stuff, I was looking i

Hello everyone! I love how awesome this community is and after reading a few beginner posts, I finally mustered up the c
ourage to share my own work.

This is my first RAG app built as part of my university project. I relied on official docu
mentation and a few YouTube tutorials to understand the process and finally got it working! The app is designed to help 
me study using the notes provided by our university, which are primarily in PDF format. As a result, the app currently s
upports PDFs as its sole input source.

# Current Challenges:

1. Follow-Up Questions: My app struggles to handle follow
-up queries effectively. Are there any tips or techniques I can implement to make it more contextually aware?
2. Respons
e Time: The app is responding quite slowly. Are there ways to optimize performance and make it respond faster?

# Additi

* The app is hosted on [https://asknotes.streamlit.app/](https://asknotes.streamlit.app/)
* **streamlit** & 
**streamlit\_chat**: For building and visualizing the app.
* **langchain**, **langchain\_community**, & **langchain\_ope

```
I recently built an AI assistant for Vectorize (where I'm CTO) and wanted to share some key technical insights about bui
lding RAG applications that might be useful to others working on similar projects. Some interesting learnings from the p
rocess: 

1. Context improves retrieval quality significantly - By embedding our assistant directly in the UI and using 
page context in our retrieval queries, we got much better results than just using raw user questions. 
2. Real-time, mul
ti-source data creates a self-improving system - We combined docs, Discord discussions, and Intercom chats. When we tag 
new support answers, they automatically get processed into our vector index. The system improves through normal daily ac
tivities. 
3. Reranking models > pure similarity search - Vector similarity scores alone weren't enough to filter out ir
relevant results (e.g., getting S3 docs when asking about Elasticsearch). Using a reranking model with a relevance thres
hold of 0.5 dramatically improved response quality. 
4. Anti-hallucination prompting is crucial - Even with good retriev
al, clear LLM instructions matter. We found emphasizing 'only use retrieved content' and adding topic context in prompts
 helped prevent hallucination, even with smaller models. The full post goes into implementation details, code examples, 
and more technical insights:

all -  [ Fast sentence transformer embeddings generation on CPU for question answering ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1hiil85/fast_sentence_transformer_embeddings_generation/) , 2024-12-24-0913
```
We have millions of documents which we want to be searchable through direct question answering (snippet based, as oppose
d to generation based, like the highlighted snippet in the following screenshot below the generated bit in Google)

http
s://preview.redd.it/4rwpsmw3yz7e1.png?width=1866&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea0178b40fc1a66a97beee7596cb70a8de52bbe1

So, fo
r this, we have to generate embeddings for all those millions of documents, put them in vector DB, and make them queryab
le at runtime. GPUs are outside our budget, so we have to do this on CPUs alone. Questions:

1. Any CPU friendly embeddi
ng model or architecture which enables us to extract sentence embeddings for all documents in our collection (followed b
y insertion in vector DB) at a pretty quick speed (comparable to GPUs) - even if it means keeping the number of dimensio
ns modest (as long as the snippet answer quality is decent)?
2. Any CPU friendly vector DB which would allow us infering
 snippets given a question at runtime pretty much in real time for high volume traffic (much like Google does here)? If 
the bottleneck for this is CPU cores, let us assume we have lots of them, since even then they are an order of magnitude
 cheaper than GPUs like A100 or H100.
3. Whatever solutions exist to the above questions - will they automatically apply
 to multiple languages, or do we have to further training and retraining with corpuses from those languages to make this
 work?
4. Will generating binary sentence embeddings on CPUs do it much faster (offsetting whatever delays normal senten
ce transformers achieve on CPUs instead of GPUs)? Like Matryoshka Embeddings?

```
I'm making an agent with LangGraph and want to persist its chat memory across sessions. There are no multiple users so a
 database may be overkill. I'm aware I need to use MemorySaver and a store. However it's unclear to me what persistent s
tores are implemented and if it will suffice to just add the MemorySaver and the store object to the graph, or if any ad
ditional code is needed to write messages to memory and restore them at the start of a session.

all -  [ Good library for LLM management ](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1highnw/good_library_for_llm_management/) , 2024-12-24-0913
```
I have a personal project already running that uses the async-openai crate for LLM management, effectively limiting myse
lf to OpenAI‘s models. 
Now I want to switch to another library to support other LLM providers too. 

My sight is on lan
gchain-rust, as it would support all large providers, but the project is pretty dead; little commits and many open issue
s. Any good suggestions for other libraries?

Edit: sorry, I forgot to add that I want the library to stream tool calls

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Minima: local conversational retrieval augmented generation project (Ollama, Langchain, FastAPI, ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h1pudq/p_minima_local_conversational_retrieval_augmented/) , 2024-12-24-0913
```
  
[https://github.com/dmayboroda/minima](https://github.com/dmayboroda/minima)  
  
Hey everyone, I would like to intro
duce you my latest repo, that is a local conversational rag on your files, Be honest, you can use this as a rag on-premi
ses, cause it is build with docker, langchain, ollama, fastapi, hf All models download automatically, soon I'll add an a
bility to choose a model For now solution contains:

* Locally running Ollama (currently qwen-0.5b model hardcoded, soon
 you'll be able to choose a model from ollama registry)
* Local indexing (using sentence-transformer embedding model, yo
u can switch to other model, but only sentence-transformers applied, also will be changed soon)
* Qdrant container runni
ng on your machine
* Reranker running locally (BAAI/bge-reranker-base currently hardcoded, but i will also add an abilit
y to choose a reranker)
* Websocket based chat with saving history
* Simple chat UI written with React
* As a plus, you 
can use local rag with ChatGPT as a custom GPT, so you able to query your local data through official chatgpt web and ma
c os/ios app.
* You can deploy it as a RAG on-premises, all containers can work on CPU machines

Couple of ideas/problem
s:

* Model Context Protocol support
* Right now there is no incremental indexing or reindexing
* No selection for the m
odels (will be added soon)
* Different environment support (cuda, mps, custom npu's)

Welcome to contribute (watch, fork
, star) Thank you so much!
