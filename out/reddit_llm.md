all -  [ Stream structured output from graph ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1fz4bdc/stream_structured_output_from_graph/) , 2024-10-09-0912
```
Is it possible to stream structured output from a LangGraph graph? I want to produce an output similar to [this](https:/
/python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/structured_output/#streaming). I tried following this [tutorial](https://langchain-ai.
github.io/langgraph/how-tos/streaming-tokens/#streaming-llm-tokens) on streaming LLM tokens but am unsuccessful so far. 
In the below code, everything runs fine until the entire response is returned from the LLM, after which I get this error
:   


    ValueError: Message dict must contain 'role' and 'content' keys, got {'setup': 'Why don't scientists trust at
oms?', 'punchline': 'Because they make up everything!', 'rating': 8}

I can bypass this error by converting the LLM resp
onse to a string in `call_model`, but that defeats the purpose of getting structured output.

Here is my code:

    impo
rt getpass
    import os
    from typing import Optional, Literal
    from typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict

    
    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
    from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END

    from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
    from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
    
    
 
   os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = getpass.getpass()
    llm = ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4o-mini')
    
    # TypedDict
    c
lass Joke(TypedDict):
        '''Joke to tell user.'''
    
        setup: Annotated[str, ..., 'The setup of the joke']

        punchline: Annotated[str, ..., 'The punchline of the joke']
        rating: Annotated[Optional[int], None, 'How 
funny the joke is, from 1 to 10']
    
    structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(Joke)
    
    class State(TypedD
ict):
        messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
    
    
    # Define the function that calls the model
    async
 def call_model(state: State, config: RunnableConfig):
        messages = state['messages']
        # Note: Passing the 
config through explicitly is required for python < 3.11
        # Since context var support wasn't added before then: ht
tps://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#creating-tasks
        response = await structured_llm.ainvoke(message
s, config)
        # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
        return {'messages': resp
onse}
    
    # Define a new graph
    workflow = StateGraph(State)
    # Define the two nodes we will cycle between
  
  workflow.add_node('agent', call_model)
    # Set the entrypoint as `agent`
    workflow.add_edge(START, 'agent')
    a
pp = workflow.compile()
    
    config = {'configurable': {'thread_id': '3'}}
    node_to_stream = 'agent'
    
    inp
uts = [HumanMessage(content='tell me a joke')]
    
    async for event in app.astream_events(
        {'messages': inpu
ts}, config, version='v2'
    ):
    
        # Get chat model tokens from a particular node
        if (
            ev
ent['event'] == 'on_chat_model_stream'
            and event['metadata'].get('langgraph_node', '') == node_to_stream
   
     ):
            print(event['data'])
```

all -  [ Agent Logging in choosing Tool ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1fz4adz/agent_logging_in_choosing_tool/) , 2024-10-09-0912
```
Hi,

I am trying to implement an internal assistant use case on top of GCP, so far we have had success with doing a redi
s cache paired with e vertex ai vector search vector store for exact matching and semantic handling and if this fails go
ing to a RAG.

  
However I am looking for the option to do the semantic matcing as a part of the RAG, I looked into the
 way tools work in Langchain and I cannot fully understand whether this is possible.

Basically what I want to do is use
 2 retrievers - one would have my structured QnA data - first look for response in this retriever and if there is respon
se - retrieve that, if there is no response - go to the second retriever which has the documentation and do retrieval an
d answer. 

  
Of course at some points I might have more retrievers and depending on the question to route between retr
ievers but this seems failry doable with Agent tools in langchain.

Can you point me in the right direction, I feel like
 this could be probably be solved with LangGraph but honestly have not done anything on it and it looks a bit more compl
ex.

Thanks!

```
Hey Folks!

We’ve just launched an integration that makes it easier to add Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to your 
LangChain apps. It’s designed to improve data retrieval and help make responses more accurate, especially in apps where 
you need reliable, up-to-date information. You can also connect documents from multiple sources like Gmail, Notion, Goog
le Drive, etc.

If you’re exploring ways to use RAG, this might save you some time. We’re working on [Ragie](https://rag
ie.ai/), a fully managed RAG-as-a-Service platform for developers.  
  
Here’s the docs if you’re interested: [https://d
ocs.ragie.ai/docs/langchain-ragie](https://docs.ragie.ai/docs/langchain-ragie)  
We’d love to hear feedback or ideas fro
m the community :)

```
 am using langchain and cohere. It works fine whenever i used `invoke` with agent executor, but whenever i moved for str
eaming and using `astream_events` i got extra data along with the response. Following is my sample code and response.

 
   agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=[search_1, search_2], verbose=True)
                
        # Get 
Response
        async for event in agent_executor.astream_events({
                    'preamble': session_data['initia
l_prompt'],
            }, version='v2'):
            if event['event'] == 'on_chat_model_stream':
                chunk
_content = serialize_aimessagechunk(event['data']['chunk'])
                chunk_content_html = chunk_content.replace('
\n', '<br>')
                yield f'data: {json.dumps({'event': 'stream', 'data': chunk_content_html})}\n\n'
          
 
    

and response:

    Plan: I will greet the user and ask for their name and location, then tailor my response acco
rdingly. Action: ```json [
        {
            'tool_name': 'directly_answer',
            'parameters': {}
        }

```
Does anyone has a framework to testing LLM applications? Im looking for a way of testing LangGraph apps as Im starting a
 new project and I need a quick way of running unit tests (as you would do with jest or mocka) but Im confused..

The un
it-testing are not really unit-testing? Because they rely on internet connection... because I need an LLM to evaluate th
e llm calls right?

I saw DeepEval for this... is this the right tool? When I read the docs I did not get why it calls a
n external llm to do the tests... Is there any other framework?  
I just want a way to run a script, fast, same as with 
pytest and get coverage,

Any ideas?

[NaturalAgents](https://github.com/NaturalAgents/NaturalAgents) is the easiest way to create AI Agents in a notion-style
 editor. It's no-code and enables anyone to build sophisticated agents. It's current in its MVP state, but it fully open
-source and will be actively maintained. 



How this is different from other agent builders -

1. No boilerplate code (
imagine langchain for multiple agents)
2. No code experience
3. Can easily share and build with others
4. Readable/organ
ized agent outputs
5. Abstracts agent communications without visual complexity (image large drag and drop flowcharts)

```
**Hey everyone!**

This is my first post here. I graduated with a Computer Science degree in May and have been applying 
for ML/Data Science roles for the last 8 months using my current resume. I’ve been interning for over a year now and wou
ld love some feedback. I have a few questions:

1. Since all of my experience is from an internship, would it be okay to
 change my title to **Data Science Engineer** (I’ve been working full-time, but the company officially classifies me as 
an intern to pay me less)?
2. Are my **projects solid**? I haven’t updated my projects section in a while, and I’m wonde
ring if my first full-stack project is still relevant. I also have several **MLOps and LLMOps projects** that I could ad
d. Should I include them?
3. Is it okay to **add additional projects**, or should I keep it concise?
4. Is the **Extra-c
urricular section** necessary for a Data Science/ML role?
5. Any recommendations for **skills** or **certifications** I 
should focus on? I’m currently doing the **AWS AI Practitioner course** but would appreciate more suggestions.

Thanks i
n advance for your help!

Hi guys, so I will cut to the chase. I am new with AI field and it's ny holiday so I'm learning a bit (completed NLP til
l BERT and GPT). 

Since it's a holidays for me till next semester I'm trying to make an AI that can talk to various dat
aset (able to did with csv, excel,  .db). I'm using the groqcloud api woth langchain library in python since its a bit f
ree till now and using llama 3.0 8192 model which was wokring better than 3.1 for me (my personal experience). I wont sa
y Im satisfied but it works. P.S: I tried Ollama Llama 3.0 8B but it works in terminal well but if I make a python scrip
t and do api call it takes me 7mins to respond to me for 'Hello' in my potato laptop or might just be my learning was du
mb. 

I would really like an advice on this for my mistakes. (my potato laptop is intel core i7).

Lastly, I'm saving th
e datasets on my  sqlite file. I do need to work to make it in cloud but am a but lazy and dumb. Most importantlyI need 
a suggestions on which backend is a good choice to save the user's chat. Because I implemented the edit feature and sinc
e I have to save both previous responses and the chat corresponding to all edit version. So would like to get some advic
e on that. My project setup right now is NextJS, python with flask api ans SQLite.

all -  [ Optimizing Prompt Usage for Search Agent with DSPy and Argilla** ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1fy2eqy/optimizing_prompt_usage_for_search_agent_with/) , 2024-10-09-0912
```
Hey LocalLLama

I’ve been working on optimizing an **ArXiv agent** using **DSPy**, **Langchain tools**, and **Argilla**.
 If you’re trying out agent this is a useful notebook.

### The Problem
I built an agent to search ArXiv papers and answ
er questions using the ArXiv API. The key challenge here was **optimizing prompt usage** to make the agent better when f
etching relevant answers from papers. 

I also found that it was difficult to review the responses because the papers ar
e long and detailed. Using a proper UI meant I could review in detail

---

### **How It Works:**

1. **Agent Setup**: I
 used **DSPy** to define a question-answer signature. The agent can now take in a paper ID and a question, then retrieve
 answers from ArXiv using the tool.

2. **Tool Interaction**: I gave it access to the **ArXiv API** as a tool. It search
es for the correct paper and extracts the necessary info.

3. **Optimization with AvatarOptimizer**: I optimized how the
 agent **structures prompts** to the ArXiv API, so it better understands how to extract relevant answers. The **AvatarOp
timizer** from DSPy helps improve tool usage, making the agent more efficient and accurate.

4. **Evaluating in Argilla*
*: To see the impact of optimization, I reviewed both the original and optimized versions of the agent in **Argilla**, w
here I compared their outputs and ranked them.

---

### **Results:**
After prompt optimization, the agent was better at
 understanding questions and extracting accurate, relevant information from ArXiv. The optimized prompts made a big diff
erence in the agent’s performance.

---

If you’re interested in building tool-using agents or optimizing prompts for AP
Is, give it a try with DSPy! You can find the example [here](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla-cookbook/blob/main/ds
py_agent_arxiv_tools_prompt_optimization.ipynb). Feel free to ask any questions or share feedback!

```
Hey all! 👋

Just wanted to share something cool I’ve been working on — optimizing an agent to search and analyze papers 
from ArXiv using DSPy, Langchain, and Argilla. If you're into AI or NLP, this might interest you. 

Here's the gist:

# 
What It’s About:

I created a tool-using agent that can search ArXiv, grab papers, and answer questions about them. Usin
g DSPy, we optimized how the agent uses tools (like the ArXiv API) to get better, faster results.

# How It Works:

1. S
et up DSPy with Llama models to handle language tasks and interact with the ArXiv API.
2. Train the agent using a QA dat
aset from ArXiv papers (with a small subset for speed).
3. Optimize with AvatarOptimizer, improving how the agent uses t
ools to handle questions more effectively.
4. Test in Argilla by comparing the original and optimized versions of the ag
ent to see which performs better.

# Results:

After optimization, the agent was more accurate in retrieving and answeri
ng questions from ArXiv. The improvements were clear when tested head-to-head!

If you’re interested in trying it out, c
heck out the [DSPy example notebook](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla-cookbook/blob/main/dspy_agent_arxiv_tools_pro
mpt_optimization.ipynb). Would love to hear your feedback!

Hi all , I'm working on a usecase where I want the LLM to return the output in JSON format .  
But I don't want to limit
 the number of keys , I don't want to define a schema .

The workflow for my usecase is something like :

1. LLM receive
s a summary text .
2. LLM has to find the key values from the text and return all those in a json format ( key-value pai
r )
3. There can be any number and type of keywords and their values for a given summary text .

I'm using Langchain.js 
, how can I build such a workflow ? what are the components that will be needed ?

```
To make an api call to anthropic from my understanding u your need: 

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
mode
l = ChatAnthropic(model='claude-3-opus-20240229')

I have the API key setup in the .env file and the important is done c
orrectly. But it’s giving an error saying I need model name, timeout, api key. But the documentation says you just need 
to put the model. Does anyone knows why is this a problem?

Hey guys,

I recently made a a RAG-based github extension that responds directly to created 'issues' in github repositor
ies with a detailed overview of files and changes to make to resolve the issue. I see this as being particularly helpful
 for industry repositories where the codebases are quite big issues are frequently used.

Would love to know what you th

```
I’m trying to use Langchain to go through about 500k docs in total doing entity and relationship extractions. 

Before u
sing Langchain it was really quick but not very thorough or reliable. 

Now using 3 chains (one for entities, one for re
lationships, one for checking if anything is missed and adding if so)

However now it’s soooo slow. Using Azure GPT inst
ance should be able to do 100 rpm. Any advice?

Edit : new to this so let me know if this is a completely bad approach!

Hello everyone,

I have been working as a freelancer in the field of data analysis for about a year now and during this 
time I have intensively acquired Python and Langchain, with which I have already implemented some smaller projects. My p
rofessional background, however, is in soccer, where I worked for many years as a youth coach and video analyst for prof
essional teams.

Recently, I have been thinking hard about how I can combine my passion for soccer with my current skill
s in data and AI. I find computer vision projects in soccer particularly exciting, for example for tactical analysis, pl
ayer development or training optimization.

The areas of application in this field are extremely diverse and I am convin
ced that there is a growing market and strong demand for this. However, as I am still new to this area, I would be very 
happy to receive your feedback and assessments - especially regarding the current market and possible entry points.

Bes
t regards from Brazil/Germany

Philipp

all -  [ Philosophy major looking for dev helper ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1fx4m47/philosophy_major_looking_for_dev_helper/) , 2024-10-09-0912
```
Hi ! I am currently a research assistant working on a RAG project to test quality, response elements and validity of dif
ferent models when answering philosophy related questions. As of now the plan the project logic is closely related to th
e one presented in *An Automatic Ontology Generation Framework with An Organizational Perspective* \[[Elnagar (2020)](ht
tps://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05910)\]. The gist of it as far as I understood is to generate a knowledge graph from an unstru
ctured corpus, from which we make domain-specific ontology. 



This two-step program has a bunch of advantages detailed
 in the paper but one specific to this research project is to allow for hybrid KG and ontology generation, for domain-sp
ecific experts to be involved in knowledge integration. This is important in philosophy since discussed relations are of
ten very abstract. It would also be useful to monitor the evolution of semantic networks in the knowledge graph as in *A
rchitecture and evolution of semantic networks in mathematics texts* \[[Christianson et. al (2020)](https://www.research
gate.net/publication/343288312_Architecture_and_evolution_of_semantic_networks_in_mathematics_texts)\]. 



As of now th
e corpus has been manually collected, but future implementations of this project may include a module that collects key 
text of a domain from anna's archive API or something adjacent. I did try making some stuff up in a notebook and succeed
ed in some basic things, like word-cloud generation and [semantic hyper-graphs](https://graphbrain.net/). 



However, I
 would like for this project to move faster than I alone can do it, hence this post. I am a philosophy major and I simpl
y have too much stuff to figure out that is trivial to most of you, I don't even know how to use langchain ffs. I would 
still like to be highly involved in the process since I love to learn and it's important to me to get better at these th
ings. 



Depending on affinities this may or may not evolves in a longer collaborative relationship since I often use c
ode-adjacent ideas in my personal research *à la* Peter Naur, but this is beside the point for this post. Please contact
 me at [shrekrequiem@proton.me](mailto:shrekrequiem@proton.me) if you are interested. If this isn't the place for this I
 would also be highly thankful to redirect me to other subreddits or online spaces where this would be more appropriate.

all -  [ Question About Agent Toolkits and Contributing to Agent tools ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1fwuyty/question_about_agent_toolkits_and_contributing_to/) , 2024-10-09-0912
```
For context, I'm basically a beginner at the LangChain codebase and want to find ways to contribute towards open source.
 Currently, I'm looking into contributing a Spotify tool for agents to use, but had a question about the file structure.


Under `libs/community/langchain_community/tools` exists all the tools that I'm assuming an agent can use, but not all 
of these tools have toolkits under `libs/community/langchain_community/agent_toolkits`.

So What are these toolkits exac
tly, and why would some of the implemented tools need them compared to others?

```
I've read through various resources such as:  
- [https://vectorize.io/how-i-finally-got-agentic-rag-to-work-right/](htt
ps://vectorize.io/how-i-finally-got-agentic-rag-to-work-right/)

module_guides/deploying/chat_engines/)  
- [https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/ChatRAG-Bench](https://huggingface.co
/datasets/nvidia/ChatRAG-Bench) 

But these feel overly reductive, since they don't address complexities like:  
1) when
 to retrieve vs. just respond immediately to reduce latency  
2) rely on existing context previously retrieved in the co
nversation instead of retrieving again at the current turn  
3) partition LLM context between retrieved information and 
past conversation history.

I'm sure some teams already have good systems for this, would appreciate pointers!

MachineLearning -  [ Built a web agent which call fill Google forms based on the user details [P] ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fozud5/built_a_web_agent_which_call_fill_google_forms/) , 2024-10-09-0912
```
GitHub repo : [https://github.com/shaRk-033/web-agent](https://github.com/shaRk-033/web-agent)

Tried to solve it using 
two approaches:

# 1: Basic Scraping and Filling

This is the straightforward approach. The agent scrapes the form’s HTM
L and uses fixed XPaths to find and fill in the required fields.

* It pulls the form’s HTML, locates the fields with se
t XPaths, and inputs the answers. It’s a direct and simple method.
* If the form changes or an element isn’t where it’s 
expected, the process can fail and may need manual adjustments.

[basic approach](https://preview.redd.it/5e8g4a1k4xqd1.
png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8e984e4feaee2f0453b08c8696768c40a2a5c20)

2. Using LangChain Agents and tool call
ing

* LangChain Agent**:** The agent handles everything by using the LLM’s reasoning to decide what to do next, includi
ng generating those tricky XPaths.
* Error Handling**:** If something goes wrong (like an element not found), the agent 
tries again with better XPaths until it gets the job done.

[using langchain agents](https://preview.redd.it/948i88pl4xq
d1.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed1e6c19efec9f4cbbbd6ab5a22558f221cf745f)

Any recommendations to improve this w
ould be welcome. Also, if anyone has ideas on building similar web agents to automate other tasks, it would be great to 
hear them. :)

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Swapping Embedding Models for an LLM ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fktvbj/p_swapping_embedding_models_for_an_llm/) , 2024-10-09-0912
```
How tightly coupled is an embedding model to a language model?

Taking an example from Langchain's tutorials, they use O
llama's _nomic-embed-text_ for embedding and _Llama3.1_ for the understanding and Q/A. I don't see any documentation abo
ut Llama being built on embeddings from this embedding model. 

Intuition suggests that a different embedding model may 
produce outputs of other sizes or produce a different tensor for a character/word, which would have an impact on the res
ults of the LLM. So would changing an embedding model require retraining/fine-tuning the LLM as well?

I need to use a e
mbedding model for code snippets and text. Do I need to find a specialized embedding model for that? If yes, how will ll
ama3.1 ingest the embeddings?

deeplearning -  [ What is the best approach for Parsing and Retrieving Code Context Across Multiple Files in a Hierarc ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1fh58oz/what_is_the_best_approach_for_parsing_and/) , 2024-10-09-0912
```
I want to implement a Code-RAG system on a code directory where I need to:

* Parse and load all the files from folders 
and subfolders while excluding specific file extensions.
* Embed and store the parsed content into a vector store.
* Ret
rieve relevant information based on user queries.

However, I’m facing two major challenges:

**File Parsing and Loading
:** What’s the most efficient method to parse and load files in a hierarchical manner (reflecting their folder structure
)? Should I use Langchain’s directory loader, or is there a better way? I came across the Tree-sitter tool in Claude-dev
’s repo, which is used to build syntax trees for source files—would this be useful for hierarchical parsing?

**Cross-Fi
le Context Retrieval:** If the relevant context for a user’s query is spread across multiple files located in different 
subfolders, how can I fine-tune my retrieval system to identify the correct context across these files? Would reranking 
resolve this, or is there a better approach?

**Query Translation:** Do I need to use Something like Multi-Query or RAG-
Fusion to achieve better retrieval for hierarchical data?

\[I want to understand how tools like [continue.dev](http://c
ontinue.dev/) and [claude-dev](https://github.com/saoudrizwan/claude-dev) work\]
