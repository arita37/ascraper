```
I've noticed feedback from the community indicating dissatisfaction with LangChain. Before I begin building my first MVP
, I'd like to get recommendations for alternative frameworks. I'm looking for options that would work well for both MVP 
development and production deployment. If there's a single framework suitable for both stages, that would be ideal, but 
I'm also open to hearing about different frameworks optimized for each phase. What would you recommend?

```
We at [Composio](https://composio.dev/) are building the tool infrastructure for AI agents, and one of our users' bigges
t requests was toolkits for building custom coding agents that work. So, we created SWE-Kit, a starter template with all
 the toolkits for building AI coding agents.

To test the efficiency of our tools, we built a comprehensive AI agent com
plete [open-source ](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio/tree/master/python/swe/agent)using LangGraph and tested it o
n [SWE-bench](https://www.swebench.com/) verified, and it got 48.60%.

* **Code Analysis Tool:** Intelligently retrieves
 relevant code snippets from the repository.
* **File Tool:** Facilitates navigation and updates to files.
* **Shell Too
l:** Performs shell operations.
* **Git Tool:** Handles version control tasks.

We optimized the tools for improved func
tion calling accuracy.

The code is open-source, and you can even modify it to add external integrations like GitHub, Li
near, Slack, etc., using Composio to build a full-fledged AI software engineer. Check out the [SWE-Kit agent](https://bl
og.langchain.dev/composio-swekit/) blog published on LangChains’ blog for an architectural explanation of the SWE agent.


Write code, review it, write tests, and more.

I am not even kidding. Many companies have raised millions just from th
is.

I'm currently building a RAG + Big data platform/marketplace. It will be modular drag and drop pipelines. Think what hom

it comes to branding and marketing, we have a massive advantage. If you have built something along these lines, DM me. I

```
# This is my first time posting, so please forgive me if I make any mistakes.

I’m working on a project to automate repe
titive data processing tasks like cleaning, and formatting using large language models (LLMs) and Python tools. My idea 
is to:

1. Use frameworks like LangChain or CrewAI to manage interactions between user prompts and the LLM.
2. Store pre
defined knowledge (e.g., conventions and rules) in a vector database like Pinecone or ChromaDB for the LLM to reference 
during processing.

Does this architecture make sense for automating workflows? Also, how should I evaluate the system’s
 performance, such as accuracy in interpreting prompts or reliability compared to manual methods?

I’d appreciate any su
ggestions, resources, or guidance on tools and evaluation methods for implementing this system.

I'm trying to navigate the docs and understand how to make an agent with tools AND prompt. The following code shows two 
ways to do this, neither really works. What is the proper way to do this, and populate the fields of the prompt? I can't
 get it to work.

PS. I use JS LangChain

    const agent = createReactAgent({
      llm,
      tools,
      prompt   //
 PROMPT can be any prompt include one with {input} {field1} {field2}
    });
    agent.invoke({
      messages: [
      
  {
          role: 'user',
          content: `This is the input question?`,   // Can't specify {input} fields?!?!
    
    },
      ],
    })
    
    // Why I have to provide tools and prompts here again when agent already have it?!?!?
  
  const executor = AgentExecutor.

    ({
      agent: agent,
      tools: tools,

hello everyone! here's doc2exam

a place to turn any material into live exams -- for students prepping or professors set
ting official certifications

working on doc2exam proved to be really fun, I've learned svelte5, deepened my django skil
ls, and rag/llm skills.

I've found [llamaindex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) is much easier to use than la
ngchain, and the reddit dwarfs and yc hackers are right, at least in my case: langchain is over-engineered for most peop
le

but llamaindex also tries too hard in some places to replace manual prompt engineering, and I had to dodge many of i
ts incomplete (and sometimes inconsistent or unintuitive) apis

\# What My Project Does

it turns any material into a fu
lly-fledged live exam that you can send to your students who can take it online., and receive a perma-url certificate li
ke on Coursera (which you can attach to your linkedin or whatever).  
the idea is to have the examination part of a cour
se completely automated, while the teaching itself is still driven by a human (as per the neoducation manifesto - google
 it).

  
\# Target Audience

Schools, Professors or students prepping for exams

  
\# Comparison

[https://jungleai.co
m/](https://jungleai.com/) \-- more of a flashcard generator, and it focuses on student prepping while doc2exam is prima
rily targeted towards professors (but students can use it just as easily for prep)

[https://www.marquiz.io/](https://ww
w.marquiz.io/) \-- the term 'quiz' is too casual for doc2exam's intended scope: to become a de-facto platform for exam g
eneration but also, equally important, live exam taking

```
I would like to create application that would support work of Lawyer / Notary.

Functionality is as follows:

\- Person 
types his case for example 'My client wants to sell property X in place X with etc'

\- Application would extract releva
nt law and acts and provide suggestions guidance.

Resources:

I have access to API that provides list of all Acts and L
aws (in JSON format)

Currently Notary is searching himself (some of them he remembers but he is also just browsing)

[h
ttps://api.sejm.gov.pl/eli/acts/DU/2020](https://api.sejm.gov.pl/eli/acts/DU/2020)

When you have specific Act - you can
 download it as PDF

[https://api.sejm.gov.pl/eli/acts/DU/2020/1/text.pdf](https://api.sejm.gov.pl/eli/acts/DU/2020/1/te
xt.pdf)

Challange:

\- As you can imagine list of all acts if very long (for each year around 2000 acts) but only few a
re really relevant for each case

The approach I'm thinking about:

Only thing that comes to my mind is storing the list
 of all acts in vector store, and making first call asking to find acts that might be relevant in this case, then extrac
ting those relevant PDF's and making another call to give summary and guidance.

Thoughts:

I don't want AI to make dete
rministic answer but rather to provide context for Notary to make decision.

But I'm not sure if this approach is possib
le to implement as this combined JSON would have probably like 10 000 objects.

What do you think? Do you have other ide
as? Is it feasible?

Hi everyone,

I’m thrilled to share some work I’ve been doing with LangGraph, and I’d love to get your feedback! A while
 ago, I created a tutorial showcasing a “Dangerously Smart Agent” using LangGraph to orchestrate dynamic AI agents capab
le of generating, reviewing, and executing Python code autonomously. Here’s the original video for context:
📺 Original V
ideo: The Dangerously Smart Agent
https://youtu.be/hthRRfapPR8

Since then, I’ve made significant updates:

1. Enhanced 
Prompt Engineering: Smarter, optimized prompts to boost performance.


2. Improved Preprocessor Agent Architecture: A cl
eaner, more efficient design.


3. Model Optimization: I’ve managed to get smaller models like Llama 3.2: 3B to perform 
comparably to Nemotron 70B—a huge leap in accessibility and efficiency!



Here’s the updated tutorial with all the chan
ges:

I’d really appreciate your thoughts on the follow
ing:

Workflow improvements: Are there areas where I can refine the agent’s process further?

Scaling with smaller model
s: Does anyone have experience or tips for improving even further with small models?

General feedback: What do you thin

 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1h5ynci/langgraph_preventing_an_agent_from_assuming_users/) , 2024-12-05-0914
```
Hi all,

I've implemented a ReAct-inspired agent connected to a curriculum specific content API. It is backed by Claude 
3.5 Sonnet. There are a few defined tools like `list_courses`, `list_units_in_course`, `list_lessons_in_unit`, etc.

The
 chat works as expected an asking the agent 'what units are in the Algebra 1 course' fires off the expected tool calls. 
However, the actual response provided is often along the lines of:

* text: *'Sure...let me find out'*
* tool\_call: `li
st_courses`
* tool\_call: `list_units_in_course`
* text: *'I've called tools to answer your questions.* ***You can see t
he units in Algebra 1 above***\*'\*

**The Issue**

The assistant is making the assumption that tool calls and their res
ults are rendered to the user in some way. That is not the case.

**What I've Tied:**

* Prompting with strong language 
explaining that the user can definitely not see tool\_calls on their end.
* Different naming conventions of tools, eg `f
etch_course_list` instead of `list_courses`

Neither of these solutions completely solved the issue and both are stochas
tic in nature. They don't guarantee the expected behavior.

**What I want to know:**

Is there an architectural pattern 
that guarantees LLM responses **don't** make this assumption?

```
Hello!

This is the 3rd update of the Project Alice framework/platform for agentic workflows: [https://github.com/Marian
oMolina/project\_alice/tree/main](https://github.com/MarianoMolina/project_alice/tree/main)

**Project Alice** is an ope
n source platform/framework for agentic workflows, with its own React/TS WebUI. It offers a way for users to create, run
 and perfect their agentic workflows with 0 coding needed, while allowing coding users to extend the framework by creati
ng new API Engines or Tasks, that can then be implemented into the module. The entire project is build with readability 
in mind, using Pydantic and Typescript extensively; its meant to be self-evident in how it works, since eventually the g
oal is for agents to be able to update the code themselves. 

At its bare minimum it offers a clean UI to chat with LLMs
, where you can select any of the dozens of models available in the 8 different LLM APIs supported (including LM Studio 
for local models), set their system prompts, and give them access to any of your tasks as tools. It also offers around 2
0 different pre-made tasks you can use (including research workflow, web scraping, and coding workflow, amongst others).
 The tasks/prompts included are not perfect: The goal is to show you how you can use the framework, but you will need to
 find the right mix of the model you want to use, the task prompt, sys-prompt for your agent and tools to give them, etc
. 

# Whats new?

\- **RAG**: Support for RAG with the new Retrieval Task, which takes a prompt and a Data Cluster, and 
returns chunks with highest similarity. The RetrievalTask can also be used to ensure a Data Cluster is fully embedded by
 only executing the first node of the task. Module comes with both examples. 

[RAG](https://preview.redd.it/7fzgxhg7xh4
e1.png?width=2856&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c311e895c2f24537efb57793a6b3e9d47cde8cb)

\- **HITL**: Human-in-the-loop mecha
nics to tasks -> Add a User Checkpoint to a task or a chat, and force a user interaction 'pause' whenever the chosen nod
e is reached. 

[Human in the loop](https://preview.redd.it/wyz3j7t0xh4e1.png?width=2856&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfdbd1ca
96cd23d0d5a89c450cae714ed78bf4fd)

\- **COT**: A basic Chain-of-thought implementation: \[analysis\] tags are parsed on 
the frontend, and added to the agent's system prompts allowing them think through requests more effectively

[Example of
 Analysis and Documents being used](https://preview.redd.it/bqm9i4nffg4e1.jpg?width=1581&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4fb4d64
0687d885c1c17193e29ca3da9dbe76c7e)

\- **DOCUMENTS**: Alice Documents, represented by the \[aliceDocument\] tag, are par
sed on the frontend and added to the agent's system prompts allowing them to structure their responses better

[Document
 view](https://preview.redd.it/gidsz90ifg4e1.jpg?width=1591&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dad04e284dd0834e3ea1714ebe4243b700aa
bac9)

**- NODE** **FLOW**: Fully implemented node execution logic to tasks, making workflows simply a case where the no
des are other tasks, and other tasks just have to define their inner nodes (for example, a PromptAgentTask has 3 nodes: 
llm generation, tool calls and code execution). This allows for greater clarity on what each task is doing and why

[Tas
k response's node outputs](https://preview.redd.it/f1hp7p4ofg4e1.jpg?width=1877&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ded4170ce9a93a29
e3cab855e06aaa430b3a8516)

\- **FLOW VIEWER**: Updated the task UI to show more details on the task's inner node logic a
nd flow. See the inputs, outputs, exit codes and templates of all the inner nodes in your tasks/workflows. 

[Task flow 
view](https://preview.redd.it/29wurpckfg4e1.jpg?width=1861&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6093d1ca8fc96cc2a5791bc3287fa08ea215a
7ef)

\- **PROMPT PARSER**: Added the option to view templated prompts dynamically, to see how they look with certain in
puts, and get a better sense of what your agents will see

[Prompt parser](https://preview.redd.it/csyj3yzrfg4e1.jpg?wid
th=1599&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ab4b42d3f8048182d1c8d368e494084cabdacb42)

\- **APIS**: New APIs for Wolfram Alpha, Goog
le's Knowledge Graph, PixArt Image Generation (local), Bark TTS (local). 

\- **DATA CLUSTERS**: Now chats and tasks can
 hold updatable data clusters that hold embeddable references like messages, files, task responses, etc. You can add any
 reference in your environment to a data cluster to give your chats/tasks access to it. The new retrieval tasks leverage
 this.

\- **TEXT MGMT**: Added 2 Text Splitter methods (recursive and semantic), which are used by the embedding and RA
G logic (as well as other APIs with that need to chunk the input, except LLMs), and a Message Pruner class that scores a
nd prunes messages, which is used by the LLM API engines to avoid context size issues

**- REDIS QUEUE**: Implemented a 
queue system for the Workflow module to handle incoming requests. Now the module can handle multiple users running multi
ple tasks in parallel. 

\- **Knowledgebase:** Added a section to the Frontend with details, examples and instructions. 


\- \*\***NOTE**\*\*: If you update to this version, you'll need to reinitialize your database (User settings -> Danger
 Zone). This update required a lot of changes to the framework, and making it backwards compatible is inefficient at thi
s stage. Keep in mind Project Alice is still in Alpha, and changes should be expected

# What's next? Planned developmen
ts for v0.4:

\- Agent using computer

\- Communication APIs -> Gmail, messaging, calendar, slack, whatsapp, etc. (some 
more likely than others) 

\- Recurring tasks -> Tasks that run periodically, accumulating information in their Data Clu
ster. Things like 'check my emails', or 'check my calendar and give me a summary on my phone', etc. 

\- CUDA support fo
r the Workflow container -> Run a wide variety of local models, with a lot more flexibility

\- Testing module -> Build 
a set of tests (inputs + tasks), execute it, update your tasks/prompts/agents/models/etc. and run them again to compare.
 Measure success and identify the best setup. 

\- Context Management w/LLM -> Use an LLM model to (1) summarize long me
ssages to keep them in context or (2) identify repeated information that can be removed

# At this stage, I need help. 


**I need people to:**

\- Test things, find edge cases, find things that are non-intuitive about the platform, etc. Als
o, improving / iterating on the prompts / models / etc. of the tasks included in the module, since that's not a focus fo
r me at the moment. 

\- I am also very interested in getting some help with the frontend: I've done my best, but I thin
k it needs optimizations that someone who's a React expert would crush, but I struggle to optimize. 

And so much more. 
There's so much that I want to add that I can't do it on my own. I need your help if this is to get anywhere. I hope tha
t the stage this project is at is enough to entice some of you to start using, and that way, we can hopefully build an a
ctual solution that is open source, brand agnostic and high quality. 

Cheers!

```
Many people say it is not worth putting effort into Product Hunt, but we at [Composio](https://composio.dev/) might have
 had a different experience. We are an AI developer tool start-up, and last month, we launched two products(SWE-Kit and 
AgentAuth), which came first and third, respectively.

This gave us a lot of exposure. We were listed in multiple high-q
uality directories, newsletters, and blogs, and many people started talking about us on social media. We are still getti
ng traffic from all these sites. We gained upward of 1k signed-up users from these two launches. This was big for us. We
 now have a better domain rating and authority, which is worth every penny.

So, how did we do it?

We were on a tight b
udget, so we had to do everything ourselves.

1. **Blogs** As we are a dev tool start-up and our ICP is a software devel
oper; we wrote blogs on DevTo, HackerNoon, etc. This only got us 1.5k visitors. If you are serving developers, consider 
this.
2. **Collabs**: We collaborated with a few reputed brands in the industry, like LangChain (we used their framework
 to build an agent that topped the SWE bench), Replit, LlamaIndex, etc., so it was easy for them to promote us. Always m
ake sure you’re providing value before reaching out. Reach out to the brands you have made your app with; they are usual
ly open to share if there is an 'Aha' factor.
3. **Social Media** It was the centrepiece of our marketing channels.
   *
 **Reddit**: We found relevant subreddits for our niche, like LocalLlama, Self-hosted, Open-source, Programming, etc. an
d wrote about us, ensuring it didn’t violate rules.
   * **X(Twitter)/LinkedIn:** Posted a long-form catchy launch post 
with a video illustration, as these platforms are biased around it. Also, we made the brand's quote repost us. If you do
 not have brand collabs, get influencers from your niche and try to boost it. Instead of a different post, ask them to q
uote it. This worked better for us.
4. **Slack Channels** This might be icky, but it works. We collected a lot of Slack 
channels. Set up automation and send messages to members. This is still a danger zone, as you risk getting called out. G
ood, meaning people will be fine with it. You can do it at your own risk.
5. Once you rank on top, milk it to the best o
f your ability, writing blogs and tweets and sharing as much as possible.

We did this for all our launches, and we got 
a really good number of impressions (200k+) and users.

At the end of the day, it’s you and your product. Make sure it i
s interesting and provides value to the intended users.

Feel free to ask any questions or share anything you have done 
that helped you. Let’s help each other.

Hi,

I am working on a presentation, and I would like to draw a similar hand-drawn style graph to the ones in the LangCh

Does anyone know what do they use to create such figures? Otherwise similar 
tools are also appreciated.

Portfolio building, networking and preparing for interviews is already assumed but ...


Our time is limited. We cannot learn and focus on everything. What skills might be best spend on to land a job within t
his timeframe.

My educational background: 

1. Bachelor of Computing in Information Systems 

2. Currently persuing Msc
 Data Science and Computational Intelligence. (9 months left to graduate). All courses are finished, just the thesis lef

My professional background:

Have experience as a content writer, content editor, technical writer etc.

Have done a
n 8 week Software Engineering internship (focused on fullstack JS/TS stack.)

Have done 2 months Internship as a 'Data S
cience intern' but it was focused on web scraping, cleaning data obtained through an API to generate market leads, build
ing proof of concept LLM applications using Langchain and Google Gemini/OpenAI API keys.

2. Please don't ask me to look at job postings, ask ChatGPT, Google. I've done those things. Job descriptions are like w

```
In this blog post, we'll explore a Python script that serves as a foundation for building such an AI assistant. We'll de
lve into how you can use this code as a starting point and discuss several exciting applications, complete with follow-u
p prompts to inspire your next project.

  
Read about some of the possible applications of this starting point on my no
n-monetized blog or just check out the repo.

[https://danielkliewer.com/2024/12/02/persona-chat](https://danielkliewer.
com/2024/12/02/persona-chat)

`git clone` [`https://github.com/kliewerdaniel/PersonaChat.git`](https://github.com/kliewe
rdaniel/PersonaChat.git)

The provided Python script leverages the power of LangChain, OpenAI's GPT models, and vector d
atabases to create an AI assistant that imitates the writing style of a specific persona based on provided writing sampl
es. Here's what the script does:

1. **Loads Writing Samples**: Reads text and PDF files from a specified folder to gath
er writing samples.
2. **Processes and Embeds Text**: Splits the text into manageable chunks and creates embeddings usin
g OpenAI's API.
3. **Creates a Vector Store**: Stores the embeddings in a Chroma vector store for efficient retrieval.
4
. **Sets Up a Retrieval QA Chain**: Uses LangChain's RetrievalQA to build an interactive question-answering system.
5. *
*Interacts with the User**: Provides a conversational interface where the AI assistant responds in the persona's writing
 style.
6. **Saves Conversations**: Logs the conversation history into a Markdown file for future reference.

Any viewpoints would be appreciated be

I’m terms of parallelisation and managing the state of the graph, does langgraph rally

```
Hey folks, I was tasked with making a Question Answering Chatbot for my firm -
I ended up with a Question Answering chai
n via Langchain
I'm using the following models -
For Inference: Mistral 7B (from Ollama)
For Embeddings: Llama 2 7B (Oll
ama aswell)
For Vector DB: FAISS Local DB

I like this system because I get to produce a chat-bot like answer via the In
ference Model - Mistral, however, due to my lack of experience, I decided to simply go with Llama 2 for Embedding model.


Each of my org's documents are anywhere from 5000-25000 characters in length. There's about 13 so far and more to be a
dded as time passes (current count at about 180,000) [I convert these docs into one long text file which is auto-formatt
ed and cleaned].
I'm using the following chunking system:
Chunk Size: 3000
Chunk Overlap: 200

I'm using FAISS' similari
ty search to retrieve the relevant chunks from the user prompt - however the accuracy massively degrades as I go beyond 
say 30,000 characters in length. I'm a complete newbie when it comes to using Vector-DB's - I'm not sure if I'm supposed
 to fine-tune the Vector DB, or if I should opt for a new Embedding Model. But I'd like some help, tutorial and other he
lpful resources will be a lifesaver! I'd like a Retrieval System that has good accuracy with fast Retrieval speeds - how
ever the accuracy is a priority. 

Thanks for the long read!

```
Weekend Build: I replaced my voicemail with ChatGPT.

Features:
- Books meeting on Calendly
- Spam filter
- Knows me (RA
G)

Why?: It sucks to call doctors, lawyers etc to schedule a meeting or get simple information. I know this will become
 standard.

Story: When I worked at the Pentagon, we had a really sweet elderly secretary Barbara. If I released this I'
d call this CallBarbara AI.

Tech: Twilio (phone), Deepgram (TTS), OpenAI (LLM), LangChain RAG (for my information), Cal
endly (availability), Google (calendar int). Unfortunately Calendly API blows so I had to use google's api. 

Learnings:
 I could make this significantly faster and more expensive with OpenAI's realtime voice (Speech-to-speech), or an open s
ource version. 

Next/ Maybe: 
- Build front end (for anyone to use)
- Clone any voice
- Figure out use-cases (SMB brick
 and mortar?)

```
Hey everyone! I'm currently working on an AI-based grant writing system that includes two main features:

Main  AI: Uses
 LLMs to generate grant-specific suggestions based on user-uploaded documents.

Copilot Feature: Allows document-specifi
c Q&A by utilizing a query format like /{filename} {query} to fetch information from the specified document.

Currently,
 we use FAISS for vector storage and retrieval, with metadata managed through .pkl files. This setup works for similarit
y-based retrieval of relevant content. However, I’m considering introducing a reranking model to further enhance retriev
al accuracy, especially for our Copilot feature.

Challenges with Current Setup:

Document-Specific Retrieval: We're sto
ring document-specific embeddings and metadata in .pkl files, and retrieval works by first querying FAISS.

Objective: I
mprove the precision of the results retrieved by Copilot when the user requests data from a specific document (e.g., /ex
ample.pdf summarize content).

Questions for the Community:

Is using a reranking model (e.g., BERT-based reranker, Mini
LM) a good idea to add another layer of precision for document retrieval, especially when handling specific document req
uests?

If I implement a reranking model, do I still need the structured .pkl files, or can I rely solely on the embeddi
ngs and reranking for retrieval?

How can I effectively integrate a reranking model into my current FAISS + Langchain se
tup?

I’d love to hear your thoughts, and if you have experience in using reranking models with FAISS or similar, any ad
vice would be highly appreciated. Thank you!

        temperature=0,
        max
_tokens=3,
        timeout=None,
        max_retries=2,
    )

Here I create an instance of the Claude 3.5 Sonnet and la
ter on using LangChain I pass it on a prompt to make a simple classification and within this prompt I have few shot exam
ples.

Initially it was working well and i had it restricted to 3 labels. Now it is trying to generate non-sense argumen
tation of why it thinks the classification is..

I run the same chains with OpenAI API and I don't have any issues what 
so ever.

What is causing this to happen?

Again to clarify, it outputs 3 tokens, but not the ones I want.

I want it to
 output \[Bullish, Bearish, Neutral\], instead it gives me something like 'The article suggests'

Is there some type of 
memory reset that might be causing the issue?

  
I am using the paid API version.

The outputs are given here:

('Bulli
sh', 'Here are the')

first output is OPEN AI, which is working as intented. The second output is Claude.

I 
am trying to implement a feature that can extract all the topics and its subtopics from pdfs or docs uploaded by the use
r. The issue is i can't figure out how do I do a vector search on the pdfs vector storage. I want this kind of structure
 attached in the image. I get it i can structurer the data using LLM, but how do I get all the topics from the pdfs uplo
aded. Either I can extract keywords from each chunk by giving it to llm but that will use soo manny tokens. I am new to 
langchain as well. Also show up a screenshot or something how do you guys setup your agents in js.

```
I am working on a RAG system for analysing and pulling information out of documents. These documents come from various c
lients and thus the structure and layout of the documents is very different from one document to the next, also the file
 types (can be pdf, docx). I am thus struggling to find a good method for chunking which I can apply to all documents th
at come in. At the moment I am simply pulling all of the text out of the document and then using semantic splitting. Ive
 also dabbled in using an agent to help me split but that has also not been super reliable.

Any tips on how I can handl
e diverse document sets?

[https://github.com/dmayboroda/minima](https://github.com/dmayboroda/minima)  
  
Hey everyone, I would like to intro
duce you my latest repo, that is a local conversational rag on your files, Be honest, you can use this as a rag on-premi
ses, cause it is build with docker, langchain, ollama, fastapi, hf All models download automatically, soon I'll add an a
bility to choose a model For now solution contains:

* Locally running Ollama (currently qwen-0.5b model hardcoded, soon
 you'll be able to choose a model from ollama registry)
* Local indexing (using sentence-transformer embedding model, yo
u can switch to other model, but only sentence-transformers applied, also will be changed soon)
* Qdrant container runni
ng on your machine
* Reranker running locally (BAAI/bge-reranker-base currently hardcoded, but i will also add an abilit
y to choose a reranker)
* Websocket based chat with saving history
* Simple chat UI written with React
* As a plus, you 
can use local rag with ChatGPT as a custom GPT, so you able to query your local data through official chatgpt web and ma
c os/ios app.
* You can deploy it as a RAG on-premises, all containers can work on CPU machines

Couple of ideas/problem
s:

* Model Context Protocol support
* Right now there is no incremental indexing or reindexing
* No selection for the m
odels (will be added soon)
* Different environment support (cuda, mps, custom npu's)

Welcome to contribute (watch, fork
, star) Thank you so much!

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Open-source declarative framework to build LLM applications - looking for contributors ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gkpazh/p_opensource_declarative_framework_to_build_llm/) , 2024-12-05-0914
```
I've been building LLM-based applications, and was super frustated with all major frameworks - langchain, autogen, crewA
I, etc. They also seem to introduce a pile of unnecessary abstractions. It becomes super hard to understand what's going
 behind the curtains even for very simple stuff.

[So I just published this open-source framework GenSphere.](https://gi
thub.com/octopus2023-inc/gensphere) The idea is have something like **Docker for LLMs**. You build applications with YAM
L files, that define an execution graph. Nodes can be either LLM API calls, regular function executions or other graphs 
themselves. Because you can nest graphs easily, building complex applications is not an issue, but at the same time you 
don't lose control.

You basically code in YAML, stating what are the tasks that need to be done and how they connect. O
ther than that, you only write individual python functions to be called during the execution. No new classes and abstrac
tions to learn.

Its all open-source. **Now I'm looking for contributors** to adapt the framework for cycles and conditi
onal nodes - which would allow full-fledged agentic system building! Pls reach out  if you want to contribute, there are
 tons of things to do!

PS: [you can read the detailed docs here,](https://gensphere.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) And go o
ver this quick [Google Colab tutorial.](https://github.com/octopus2023-inc/gensphere/blob/main/examples/gensphere_tutori
al.ipynb)
