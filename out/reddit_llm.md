```
I have a PromptTemplate with three inputs: cause, symptom, and action. My LLM should use the inputs to produce a 'theme'
 it gathers from the inputs. However, I am getting an error because the chain.invoke method expects one input instead of
 multiple.

This is the error that is thrown: ValueError: Invalid input type <class 'dict'>. Must be a PromptValue, str,
 or list of BaseMessages.

All the examples of invoking a chain in the langchain documentation only have one input. What
 am I supposed to do when my prompt template contains three inputs?

For reference, this is the code:

`llm = AzureChatO
penAI()`

`prompt_template = PromptTemplate(`

`input_variables=['cause', 'symptom', 'action'],`

`template='''`

`Root 
Cause:`

`{cause}`

`Complaint Symptom:`

`{symptom}`

`Corrective Action:`

`{action}`

`Based on the information provi
ded above, generate a concise 'Failure Theme' encapulating the reason for the failure.`

`Failure Theme:`

`'''`

`)`

`
chain = llm | prompt_template | StrOutputParser()`

`root_cause = df.iloc[0]['Root Cause']`

`complaint_symptom = df.ilo
c[0]['Complaint Symptom']`

`corrective_action = df.iloc[0]['Corrective Action']`

`chain.invoke({'cause': root_cause, '
symptom': complaint_symptom, 'action': corrective_action})`

Hey r/resumes,

I'm a recent grad with about 2 years of experience as a data and backend engineer at a boutique consulti
ng firm (roughly around B4 caliber, though that could be hit-or-miss when it comes to SWE-type roles afaik). I'm wonderi
ng where my resume can be improved in terms of bullets, structure, wordiness, or any other shortcomings y'all may see. I
'm confident in my abilities and experience, but have been receiving rejection after rejection to the point where I'm un
sure where the problem is. Given how tough the market is now, I'd appreciate any advice you have on how to level this up
 as I do think I tick a lot of the boxes I see on job postings - just want to make sure I'm not going wrong somewhere.


Thanks!

I have a huge schema in the neo4j database.

I'm using the LangChain function to generate a cypher query

chain = GraphC

chain.invoke(query)

It's returning an er
ror saying that the model supports 16k tokens and I'm passing 15M+ tokens

How can I limit these tokens? I tried setting
 ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, max_tokens=1000) and it's still giving the same error.

I think it's passing the whole schema

I've intensively been building and experimenting with agents using all the famous libraries mentioned above. I've experi
mented with both Closed and Open Source LLMs and i want to share my experience.

**Quick Framework Review**

|Framework|
Strengths|Considerations|
|:-|:-|:-|
|CrewAI|High-level abstraction, good for beginners|Less mature ecosystem|
|Autogen|
Easy agent setup, multi-agent interactions|Limited external tool integration|
|Langchain|Versatile, extensive features|S
teeper learning curve|
|LlamaIndex|Specialized in data handling|Fewer agent interaction features|
|OpenAI|Direct model a
ccess, frequent updates|Requires more custom code for complex systems|

**Quick Tooling Review**

|Tools Framework|Stren
gths|
|:-|:-|
|Langchain Tools|High flexibility but increased complexity|
|Composio|Exceptionally easy third-party app i
ntegration (e.g., GitHub, Slack)|

# Detailed Review

For developers with experience in LLM-based application developmen
t, adopting any of these frameworks is relatively straightforward. Each framework offers unique opportunities to create 
innovative applications.

1. CrewAI and Autogen:
   * Recommended for beginners
   * Higher level of abstraction
   * Ea
sier entry point for AI agent development
2. Langchain:
   * Next step after gaining experience
   * Offers more refined
 outputs
   * Greater flexibility and control
3. LlamaIndex:
   * Currently less feature-rich compared to Langchain
   *
 Rapidly evolving and closing the feature gap
4. OpenAI:
   * Best framework for using ChatGPT in terms of performance
 
  * You have a good support for the framework

# Detailed Review for Tooling

# Composio

* Exceptionally easy third-par
ty app integration (e.g., GitHub, Slack)
* Minimal setup time required

# Langchain Tools

* Comprehensive toolset with 
extensive integration options
* Requires more manual configuration (auth tokens, API setup)
* High flexibility but incre
ased complexity

These insights come from my project that monitors PRs, reviews it and pings the review on slack. here's
 the link if you want to try it: [https://git.new/pr-agent](https://git.new/pr-agent)

# Challenges and Considerations


* Frequent updates lead to potential code obsolescence
* Syntax and function parameters often change
* Regular maintenan
ce required to keep applications functional

# Open Source vs. Closed Source Performance

* AI agents: Open source model
s competitive with closed-source alternatives
* Would recommend inference APIs over locally hosted ones, just on the bas
is of convenience and not performance although with weaker models you would get weaker outputs.

edit: the frameworks iv
e used are CrewAI, Langchain, Llama Index and Autogen mainly, im sure there are multiple frameworks that i'm unaware of,
 but for the sake of the post i chose these.

I want help with how to go about an idea.

I currently need to build a âvirtual assistantâ chatbot at work.

For the POC

I want through the chatbot based LLM app to be able to acc
ess the following:
1. RAG
2. Web Search
3. Normal Conversational Chat

For the persona of the chatbot, I know I can just
 set that in the context prompt of the system message.

But for the Agent capabilities, I have a simple corrective RAG a
gent graph made in LangGraph.

My questions are:
1. How do I current the capabilities of the agent graph made to my basi
c langchain chainlit app?
2. Do I need to make another conversational agent that can be routed to for normal chatbot cap
abilities or no?
3. How do I make Web Searching with Tavily an ability?
4. What will the final architecture look like?

```
So recently I was testing out the Multi-Agent Workflow of langchain with some budget constraints and hence I decided to 
use Llama 3 model from Ollama. 

I am following the supervisor structure as shown in their tutorials. The role of the su
pervisor is to simply redirect the query to one particular agent and that particular agent then handles the extraction o
f some special attributes from the user query.

[Multi-Agent Workflow Schema Diagram](https://preview.redd.it/nsib0o7btu
9d1.png?width=1934&format=png&auto=webp&s=96b120524949e1af997b82b3df221b9824ce1d8d)

Now what's happening is that when I
 run these agents (without langraph) on a individual script level for 5 user queries, the first query takes around 20 se
conds to generate the response and then the subsequent 4 queries give response like within 3 seconds. 

But when I conne
ct the supervisor to the agents using LangGraph, and I test it for the same 5 queries, each query takes > 100 seconds to
 yield the final output. 

  
My hardware specs are pretty decent i believe and should not be a hardware issue :-

RAM- 
16GB, PROCESSOR - RYZEN 9, GPU - 4GB RTX 3050

Is this happening most likely due to a code level issue or something rela
ted to my ollama server settings like number of models running parallelly?

Many youtube videos demonstrate RAG. Here are two examples:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jENqvjpkwmw](https://www.y
outube.com/watch?v=jENqvjpkwmw)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lig9c7OkxTI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lig9c7Okx
TI)

These tutorials typically show the following process: Custom data (e.g. PDFs converted to text) is loaded using Lan
gchain. The texts are split into chunks, often with overlaps. Embeddings are generated using the nomic-embed-text model.
 These embeddings are stored as a vector database in ChromaDB. The system retrieves relevant information from the vector
 database based on the user's query.

These demonstrations usually run in the Python interpreter or Jupyter notebooks. M
y question: Is it possible to combine this process with Ollama and OpenWebUI? Specifically, I'd like to create the vecto
r database once and update it regularly (e.g. weekly) with new data. I want to use this vector database by default with 
every prompt in Ollama/OpenWebUI. Is such a setup feasible? If so, how could it be implemented? I envision creating the 
vector database manually, then showing Ollama where it's located. After that, Ollama would automatically use this vector
 database for every prompt.

I understand that in Ollama/OpenWebUI, one can click on the Documents button and select fil
es. However, my scenario involves a large number of diverse files, with new ones being added weekly. Therefore, it would
 be more efficient to have a vector database that can be continuously updated.

1. Monitor a GitHub repository for new PRs  
2. Perform a code review on e
ach PR  
3. Post a summary of the review to a Slack channel

**Comparison**

* **AutoGen vs LangChain**: AutoGen excels 
in multi-agent conversations, while LangChain offers a broader toolkit for LLM applications. AutoGen required less boile
rplate for complex agent interactions in my projects.
* **AutoGen vs CrewAI**: AutoGen allows for more flexible, dynamic
 agent interactions. CrewAI is better suited for projects with predefined roles and structured workflows.
* **AutoGen vs
 LlamaIndex**: AutoGen focuses on agent interactions, while LlamaIndex specializes in data ingestion and retrieval. They
 can complement each other well in data-heavy projects.
* **AutoGen vs OpenAI library**: AutoGen provides a higher-level
 abstraction for multi-agent systems, simplifying the process compared to directly using theopenai library

```
Was writing some code that wanted to print the model string for a model without having a specific model.
Unfortunately, 
`BaseChatModel` does not have a `model` property.
Tried the set of alternatives used in my code at present, `Union[ChatO
penAI, ChatLiteLLM, ChatAnthropic]` and `ChatOpenAI` has no `model` property.
This kind of thing hurts langchain's abili
ty to paper over the differences between LLMs, which is its key strength.

I suggest a refactoring that promotes `model`
 up to the `BaseChatModel` and does something about `model` vs. `model_name` to make the latter both clearer in terms of
 its meaning (or simply an alias to the former, as it is in `ChatAnthropic` (see below). The following in `ChatLiteLLM` 
is not at all helpful:

    model_name: Optional[str] = None
    '''Model name to use.'''

As opposed to model name not 
to use?

`ChatAnthropic`:

    model: str = Field(alias='model_name')

It's ok if `model_name` is just and alias for bac
kwards compatibility, but on `ChatLiteLLM` the fact that it's `Optional` means that it might not be defined, which foils
 that purpose.

This seems like something that should be very easy to do, but I'm stu
mped.  


I suppose I can just smash together the system prompt string and the Prompt string and then make a single temp
late, but it seems wrong that we have these classes that can't be composed.  Seems like adding a `Message` to a `PromptT

Hello,

I already developed a saas for serving agentic RAG to multiple custom

However, I'm developing a new application for agentic document analysis an
d parsing, all without using anything langchain related.

For the first project, I really wanted to learn a framework th
at was 'broadly' used, but now I want the agent to 'just work' and follow the steps in the process, and 'normal' if/else
 chains coupled with 'clever' prompting seem to work without getting into any of the intricacies of Langchain/LangGraph.


So, what do you think are the REAL advantages of using LangGraph?

Hello, Im developing a OpenAi + langchain application.

I've noticed that response quality is much worse when I deploy t

Things like returning links dont work cor
rectly on the cloud and the answers give more errors in general.

Example of 1 simple question.

Question: Do you have M
eta Lava gloves?

Local (Correct Result): I recommend the Lava Meta gloves for $750. You can find them at this link:Â [ht
tps://gloves.com/shop/meta/lava-meta-flat/](https://gloves.com/shop/meta/lava-meta-flat/).

AWS US (wrong URL): The Meta
 Lava gloves are priced at $750. You can find them at this link: gloves.com/producto/meta-lava

GCP Chile (wrong URL): T
he Meta Lava gloves are priced at $750. You can find them at this link

Its not an issue with determination since respon
ses on local and cloud are very consistent. Im pretty sure everything else is exactly the same like temperature, api key
s, etc. I thought it could be an issue with jurisdiction but its the same no mater the cloud provider or region.

I'm building 
this to to continue what simpleaichat started and not to ride on hype, raise money or whatever, but to help people do 2
