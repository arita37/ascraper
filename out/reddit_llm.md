```
I'm working on a personal project and my goal is the have multiples LLM available for the users, but I got one concern, 
how can I improve the size of the context of my LLM to avoid it from loosing track of the subject that's being taking ca
re of 

Are there any techniques available for me to use or there's any limitations inherited from the LLM itself that c
an stopped me from accomplished this?

Hello! I am a recent Computer Science graduate interested mainly in Software Engineering (but with the current market I 
have branched out to anything remotely relevant). I have applied to 200-300 positions in the past few months and have on
ly gotten interviews/phone calls with a couple of training/staffing-style companies (Revature, Quintrix, Actalent, Brook
source, etc) which is not ideal. A few of them told me they would be in contact with me later on as I asked for July sta
rt dates but I am still waiting for them to reach out again. 

My main concerns with my resume include formatting and th
e wording of my bullets. However, any pointers at all would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

I would like to understand how a model is returning the right tool to call for a query, what's happening behind the api 
call for function calling for open ai, mistral and other models.

Are they using a prompt with instructions on how selec
t the right function to call? and when tools and query is passed via api, is the llm using that prompt to select the too
l or what's happening behind the call.

How do I achieve function calling using a open source model that I run locally u
sing ollama. Thanks.

all -  [ Clustering through prompting  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1d8w8am/clustering_through_prompting/) , 2024-06-06-0952
```
Group below data type items into very tight semantic groups.
Only group items together if they have exact semantic meani
ng or  can be used interchangably with each other. Break data types into maximum groups as possbile.
Return the groups i
n JSON format, ensuring that each key is exact to all the items in its list. Do not alter any characters.

Here is the l
ist of words:

['email_addr', 'email', 'email_address', 'address', 'email id', 'gmail', 'text', 'financial info', 'credi
t card number', 'cvv number', 'email address', 'eemmail', 'contact info', 'electronic mail', 'first', 'first_name', 'las
t name', 'bank details', 'firstName', 'christianName', 'christian_name', 'name', 'creadit card info', 'gsheets', 'google
 sheets', 'sheets', 'password', 'atm pin', 'atm card number', 'login details', 'vericyy', 'vericy', 'vericy.ai']

I used
 llama3 70b from groq.com

This yields average results but atleast better than hierarchical clustering with openai embed
dings.
 
What other methods beside zeronshot prompting can improve the clusters/groups while keeping costs to the minimu
m??

```
I have been doing retrieval by stacking vectors into a 2d matrix. To find similar documents, I multiply the 2d matrix by
 the other vector to find the highest similarity index. I then use that index to find the document.

I am currently plan
ning to use embedded vectors for retrieval only. Is there an advantage of using vectorstores?

Hello

So I recently got my appraisal of 6k in my monthly salary. My previous monthly salary was 23.4k CTC and after app
raisal it is 27.5k,

I told my manager that I am not satisfied with this and he told me to do some research on what is t
he current market rate for my profile and experience.

As I am not into any niche, I am confused what should be my appra
isal amount.

My profile:

I work as RnD engineer in my company. I do research on upcoming projects and develop POCs. Ho
wever, currently the software we work on is in POC stage so I work on POC but I am supposed to make it production ready 
when client is ready to buy it.

Up until now, I have worked on Azure cloud (ADF, Entra ID, Functions), Power BI (Embedd
ed reports in our custom web app) and Generative AI projects (SQL and Document chatbot). And many other research work an
d documentations.

My tech skills: Python, Generative AI (openAI API), Langchain, Azure cloud services. I also cleared A
Z-900 certificate while working here.

I have 2 years of experience working here. Started with 20k monthly CTC.

Conside
ring my profile, can you please guide me what should be my ask for my annual appraisal?

```
Hey guys, i am new to generative AI, it’s been a few days learning new things. I have a problem statement in hand. We ha
ve to evaluate a startup idea. We already have an evaluation checklist that has like 30 parameters on the basic of which
 we decide the feasibility of the idea. We have to build a model in which we prompt an idea and the input idea goes thro
ugh various agents who are (business analysts, cofounder, VC). So it first goes to BA and then the result goes to cofoun
der and so on therefore getting perspective of all the agents. For starters i want to build the model with 3 agents. Onc
e it passes through 3rd agent it gives the final result as an evaluation checklist (the same one i talked about above). 


Now my question is how should i approach this problem and what would be the underlying concept used for building such 
a model? 
Also from where can i start ? 
FYI - i read a bit about genertive ai topics like embedding, fine tuning and a 
bit of langchain (built a simple agent) etc. Still exploring agentic AI. 

Thanks in advance !!

```
I am using Langserve to create a langchain agent with tool calling. Till now all is working as expected and I am able to
 host it in AWS ECS with CDK also and learnt a lot in the process. But one thing I am stuck, in my chat, users will give
 their phone number and I will store the user as a lead in a crm I built using mongoDB. However, in the crm I want to sh
ow the chat history also.

For the chat history, I am using the mongodb integration and its working as expected when I p
ass the sessionId in the api calls.

Now I want to create a tool say \`save\_user\` which will take the phone number as 
input. I tested dummy tool calls and its working. but in the save\_user function, I want to save the phone number and th
e associated sessionId. I did not find any documentation or tutorial on how to achieve this.

This is the tool



    @t
ool('save_user', args_schema=getUserInfoInput)

all -  [ Learnings from doing Evaluations for LLM powered applications ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1d8euoz/learnings_from_doing_evaluations_for_llm_powered/) , 2024-06-06-0952
```
Learnings from doing Evaluations for LLM powered applications from my experience building with LLMs in the last few mont
hs:  
  
**Evaluations for LLM powered applications is different from Model Evaluation leaderboards like Huggingface Ope
n LLM leaderboard**  
  
If you are an enterprise leveraging or looking to leverage  LLMs, spend very little time on mod
el evaluation leaderboards. Pick the most powerful model to start with and invest in evaluating LLM responses in the con
text of your product and usecase.  
  
**Know your metrics**  
  
Ultimately what matters is whether your users are gett
ing high quality product experience. This means it's super important to look at your specific use case and determine the
 metrics that are best suited for your product.  
  
Are you building a  
  
- summarization tool? Manually evaluate the
 results and come up with your own thesis of what a good summary should look like that will solve the your user's pain p
oint.  
  
- customer support agent chatbot? Look at a few responses and figure out what you care about the most and tra
nslate those to measurable metrics.  
  
Its important to keep things simple and hyper optimize for your use case before
 jumping into measuring all the metrics that you found on the internet.  
  
**Write unit tests to capture basic asserti
ons**  
  
Basic assertions includes things like,  
- looking for a specific word in every response.  
- making sure the
 generated response obeys a specific word count.  
- making sure the generated response costs less than $ x and uses les
s than n tokens.  
  
These kinds of unit tests act as a first line of defence and will help you catch the basic issues 
quickly. If you are using python, you can use pytest to write these simple unit tests. There is no need to buy or adopt 
any fancy tools for this.  
  
**Use LLMs to evaluate the outputs**  
  
One of the popular approaches these days is to 
use a more powerful LLM to evaluate(or)grade the output of the LLM in use. This approach works well if you clearly know 
what metrics you care about which are often a bit subjective and specific to your use case.  
  
The first step here is 
to identify a prompt that can be used for running a powerful LLM to grade the outputs.   
  
There are nice opensource t
ools like Promptfoo and Inspect AI which already has built in support for model graded evaluations and unit tests which 
can be used as for starters.  
  
**Collect User Feedback**  
  
This is easier said than done. Especially for new produ
cts where there is not enough users to get quality feedback from to start with. But its important to make contact with r
eality as quickly as possible and get creative around getting this feedback - Ex: using it yourself, asking your network
, friends and family to use it etc.  
  
The goal here is to set up a system where you can diligently track the feedback
 and constantly tweak and iterate on the quality of the outputs. Establishing this feedback loop is extremely important.
  
  
**Look at your data**  
  
No matter how many charts and visualizations you can create on top of your data, there 
is no proxy to looking at your data - both test and production data. In some cases, it may not be possible to do this wh
en you are operating in a highly secure/private environment. But, you need to figure out a way to collect and look at al
l the LLM generations closely, especially in the early days. This will inform not just the quality of the outputs the us
ers are experiencing, but also push you in the direction of identifying what metrics actually make sense for your use ca
se.  
  
**Manually Evaluate**  
  
LLM based evaluations are not fool proof and you need to tweak and improve the promp
ts and grading scale continuously based on data. And the way to collect this data is by manually evaluating the outputs 
yourself. This will help you understand how far apart LLM evals is drifting from the real criteria that you want to eval
uate against. It's important to measure this drift and make sure LLM evals track closely with manual evals at most times
.  
  
**Save your model parameters**  
  
Saving the model parameters you are using and tracking the responses along wi
th the model parameters will help you with measuring the quality your product for that specific set of model parameters.
 This becomes useful when you are noticing a regression in the quality of when you are upgrading to a new model version 
or swapping out to a completely different model.  
  
Leave your thoughts. I would love to hear about your experience ma
naging your LLM powered product in terms of quality and accuracy. Also, I am also building a fully open source and open 
telemetry based tool called Langtrace AI to basically solve for the above problems.  It's super easy to setup with just 
2 lines of code. Do check it out if you are interested.

```
I spent the afternoon figuring out how to make Langchain work on a Cloudflare worker and wrote up my findings in case an
yone is looking to do the same.

Specifically, I wanted to use the PDF loader and recursive character text splitter func
tionality. The text splitter works fine, but the PDF loader has dependencies that don't run on workers.

I almost wrote 
the PDF extractor from scratch when I found a library that does exactly that. It takes a PDF or URL from a PDF and extra
cts its contents.

You can use the regular recursive character text splitter functionality with the extracted text. See 
the code snippet below.

If you are building a chatbot based on PDFs, this will come in handy. Anywho I hope this helps 
at least one person not go down the rabbit hole I just did! 

[PDF Library](https://github.com/unjs/unpdf)

**Code**

  
  import { extractText, getDocumentProxy } from 'unpdf';
    import { Document } from 'langchain/document';
    import {
 RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from 'langchain/text_splitter';
    
    export default {
        async fetch(request:
 Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {

lare_for_Campaigns_Security_Guide.pdf',
            ).then((res) => res.arrayBuffer());
    
            const pdf = awa
it getDocumentProxy(new Uint8Array(buffer));
            // Extract text from PDF
            const { totalPages, text }
 = await extractText(pdf, { mergePages: true });
    
            const splitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({

                chunkSize: 1000,
                chunkOverlap: 100,
            });

Hey, I have a Pinecone namespace with multiple documents, but as the number of documents increases, my retrieval perform
ance is getting worse. I’m thinking of creating multiple retrievers that filter by document name to get relevant chunks 
from each document. I'm struggling to create an LCEL chain to achieve this. Does anyone know how to do this?

```
Hello, I have been working on a project that involves using langchain and RAG to write direct text quotes based on sourc
ed texts.

The main objective is to create a vector database with PDF files from Google Academic and then utilize them t
o generate a user-requested text in APA format, which will output a paragraph containing direct text quotes.

For this p
roject, I have been using langchain, local llm (phi3 and llama3 with ollama or llm studio), as well as Chat GPT 4 and Gr
oq.

Unfortunately, I have encountered some difficulties as the models don't seem to follow the instructions, especially
 when it comes to using direct text quotes, even when I include instructions on how to format them in APA style.

Theref
ore, I would appreciate any ideas or suggestions from the community on how I could achieve the desired result.

Thank yo

Hi 
everyone,

I'm working on a system to integrate a tutor/assistant in Jupyter notebooks. My main issue right now is how t
o add some logic between the LLM and the chat interface: I want to store the conversations, provide real-time context fr
om the notebook or from an assignment to the agent using system prompts, etc.

Currently, I use [Jupyter-ai](https://jup
yter-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which seamlessly adds a chat interface (and several other [magical ](https://jupyter
-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/index.html#the-ai-and-ai-magic-commands)things) to a Jupyter Notebook. On the LLM sid
e, I'm using Ollama (via docker) running `codellama`. With Jupiter-ai, you can choose from multiple models (from Anthrop
ic, OpenAI, HF, etc.); the [trick ](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-ai/pull/646)is that you can choose a model fro
m OpenAI, let's say `gpt-4,` and change the base URL to the one of Ollama (`localhost:11434/v1`), then in Ollama, copy `
codellama` to a new model just *named* `gpt-4` and run that, so Jupyter-ai *thinks* it's using that.

So, can I do this 
with Ollama? Should I be using something like kcpp or lcpp? Or can I use LangChain and Python to create a REST API that 
is also like OpenAI API, so I can keep using Jupyter-ai? I'd prefer to keep it as simple as posible.

Thanks!

If so, how should I config the Input class when I add\_route? the q

Although this may be common knowledge to many here, it was eye-opening and a bit disappointing to me.

I was getting man
y `I encountered an error while trying to use the tool.` errors when using ANY search tool. To find out why, I tweaked t
he code in `site-packages/langchain_core/agents.py` to print out the search query. To my amazement, I discovered that th
e way the search query appears to work is that it just keeps sending different formats of the query until one of them wo
rks! The output below is from the verbose log showing the `<tool>:<query>` followed by the error message.  In this case,
 the search engine was EXA.

    Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
    'Search: {'The rise in homelessness and pov
erty statistics'}\n'
    I encountered an error while trying to use the tool. 
    This was the error: Exa.search() miss

    'Search: {\n  'query': 'The rise in home
lessness and poverty'\n}\n'
    {
      'query': 'The rise in homelessness and poverty'
    }

Finally, after 20 failed 
blind attempts, it found one that worked. Ironically, this is not the correct query parameter for EXA, but the EXA funct
ion converts 'query' to 'q'.

This explains why I get boatloads of meaningless error messages, which I can now ignore, u
nless NONE of them work.

**Suggestion to devs** Don't tell me about failed queries if there are GUARENTEED to be failed
 queries.   Better yet, create a query that is compatible with the API in use.

The above workflow created the correct o
utput.

With the server api, the errors are far weider...

    Thought: I need to gather information on the rise in homelessness

It's a mystery why the same query was resubmitted, but
 this was good! It was doing its homework. But of two identical queries, one responded with

    {'message': 'Missing qu
ery parameter', 'statusCode': 400}

This means the query was missing a required query parameter (400 = Bad Request statu
s code)

But even though it found a ton of links and did a lot of research, the final repost was.

    Unfortunately, du
e to the limitations of the tools provided, I was unable to gather specific information on the rise in homelessness and 
poverty in the United States. Additional resources or access to more advanced research tools would be needed to gather a
ccurate and comprehensive data on this important issue.

As these were the EXACT same workflow, with only the search too
l changed, I have to assume that Serper, or the way CrewAi handles the responses, is the reason why the workflow failed 
miserably, even though is successfully found lots of data.

There are so many inconsistencies, combined with a severe la
ck of tracking/debugging/logging tools and no docs that address or explain these issues, or worse, outdated docs that ar
e inconsistent with the official CrewAI recommendations, that even for home use, any workflow will be way too unreliable
.

For example, sometimes the serper-search workflow outputs a message saying it could not do anything (above), and some
times it outputs a good report (below). Look at the two reports below, and you will see how radically they differ based 
on when the search engine was used! That is NUTS!!

```

Hi,
I'm trying to create an LLM-based system that allows me to 'interact' with my chat logs and draw conclusions from t
hem. 
A few examples:
* Find 'sub'-conversations or messages in which a certain topic is talked about and perhaps even s
ummarize all of those 'sub'-conversations (and it's important not to miss any, which is something I've been struggling w
ith)
* Find people in my group chats that talk a lot about certain topics
And other similar prompts that I give the LLM.



Right now my solution is pretty simple. I processed all my messages with recursive character chunking and each messag
e into a document, while using a Parent Document Retriever to get more context (in the future I plan on using semantic c
hunking to make the parent documents full sub-conversations). Those are then put into a vector database, and A basic con
versational RAG agent (I currently use mixtral-instruct) with langchain. The conversations are injected as JSON as conte
xt.

First of all, I would love to know what approach you guys would take to this problem in each part of it - the embed
ding, the retrieval (is RAG even the solution here?), the context format, the agent, etc. I'm a newbie to LLMs and AI in
 general and I really want to hear the opinions of people with experience

Secondly, I have a few problems I've encounte

all -  [ RAG for IM chat logs ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1d7ghuk/rag_for_im_chat_logs/) , 2024-06-06-0952
```
Hi,
I'm trying to create an LLM-based system that allows me to 'interact' with my chat logs and draw conclusions from th
em. 
A few examples:
* Find 'sub'-conversations or messages in which a certain topic is talked about and perhaps even su
mmarize all of those 'sub'-conversations (and it's important not to miss any, which is something I've been struggling wi
th)
* Find people in my group chats that talk a lot about certain topics
And other similar prompts that I give the LLM.



Right now my solution is pretty simple. I processed all my messages with recursive character chunking and each message
 into a document, while using a Parent Document Retriever to get more context (in the future I plan on using semantic ch
unking to make the parent documents full sub-conversations). Those are then put into a vector database, and A basic conv
ersational RAG agent (I currently use mixtral-instruct) with langchain. The conversations are injected as JSON as contex
t.

First of all, I would love to know what approach you guys would take to this problem in each part of it - the embedd
ing, the retrieval (is RAG even the solution here?), the context format, the agent, etc. I'm a newbie to LLMs and AI in 
general and I really want to hear the opinions of people with experience

Secondly, I have a few problems I've encounter
ed with my setup, mainly:
* Because I currently don't split my documents semantically, I receive a big part of the conve
rsation (up to 4k+ tokens). mixtral seems to, for some reason, ignore some of my context and only remembers it starting 
from some arbitrary index, unless I really shorten it down to several hundreds of tokens. I don't understand why this ha
ppens as it should have a 32k context window. One solution I thought of was switching to llama3-8b (only 8k but might wo
rk better because it's a better model). This is a huge roadblock for this project and I'd appreciate any help here
* I'm
 not sure how to approach the not missing conversations part, as I'm always going to have a limited context. How do I ma
ke it so the agent continues fetching the rest of the convesations that were less relevant in the vector similarity sear
ch, like continually do it or something.

Thanks in advance!

```
Hello everyone, langchain noob here. I have some data that I want to use for question answering. That data has informati
on on different camera models and their specs. What I’m trying to do is retrieving the one that suites the provided use 
case best.  So far I’ve been done some experiments with langchain and also preprocessing the prompt but with not so much
 success. 

My question is: has anyone done anything similar to this? Would langchain even be the right choice here? If 
so, how would you approach this? 

Thanks in advance

```
Most LLMs, especially chat models, have some way they expect prompt to be formatted for things to work correctly (Exampl
e: https://llama.meta.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/meta-llama-3/). However, the Langchain prompts abstraction
 hides all that away and just lets users create their prompts in a clean, generalized way (https://python.langchain.com/
v0.1/docs/modules/model\_io/prompts/quick\_start/). My assumption would be that, behind the scenes, Langchain is handlin
g those details. But I can't find any information that indicates either way.

Hey r/MachineLearning, I published a new article where I built an observable semantic research paper application.

This 
is an extensive tutorial where I go in detail about:

1. Developing a RAG pipeline to process and retrieve the most rele
vant PDF documents from the arXiv API.
2. Developing a Chainlit driven web app with a Copilot for online paper retrieval
.
3. Enhancing the app with LLM observability features from Literal AI.
