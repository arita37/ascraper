Has anyone developed a system where agents can autonomously code entire agent-based systems? I’m currently facing a chal
lenge with streaming complex workflows to a chat UI efficiently. I’ve experimented with Mesop, Vercel, and Flask for cha
t tracking, but managing streams for multiple agents has proven tricky. I’m considering diving deeper into Streamlit to 
better handle chat bot integration. 

Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

I'm trying to create a RAG system for technical manuals for cms usage, the main problem here is on the reading of the pd

h page of the pdf or one documet object for the entire pdf?) and than another problem is the chunking of it. I've tried 
many strategies without getting good results. A big problem that I'm facing is about components of the cms that have pro
perties that are listed in tables that begin in one page and continue in the next page, in this cases the properties tha
t the retriever and the llm is giving as response are always incomplete because it's basically taking the first part of 
the table and missing the continuing in the next page. The document is organized in chapters for each component of the c
ms and there are around 200 of them. Is there a way to chunk the document and have a one-to-one relation between compone
nt and chunk to force the retriever to find the entire list of properties? I've tried RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter and
 SemanticChunker but they didn't give me good enough results.

```
[Graphiti](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti) is a Python library for building and querying dynamic, [temporally aware 
knowledge graphs](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti). It can be used to model complex, evolving datasets and ensure AI 
agents have access to the data they need to accomplish non-trivial tasks. It's a powerful tool that can serve as the dat
abase and retrieval layer for many sophisticated RAG projects.

**Graphiti was challenging to build.** This article disc
usses our design decisions, prompt engineering evolution, and approaches to scaling LLM-based information extraction. Th
is blog post kicks off a series exploring our challenges while building Graphiti. Reading this will deepen your understa
nding of both the Graphiti library and provide valuable insights for future development.

all -  [ Semantix : Create Super functions with the help of LLMs ](https://github.com/chandralegend/semantix) , 2024-09-13-0912
```
### What Semantix Does

Current methods for extracting structured outputs from LLMs often rely on libraries such as DSPy
, OpenAI Structured Outputs, and Langchain JSON Schema. These libraries typically use Pydantic Models to create JSON sch
emas representing classes, enums, and types. However, this approach can be costly since many LLMs treat each element of 
the JSON schema (e.g., `{}`, `:`, `'$'`) as separate tokens, leading to increased costs due to the numerous tokens prese
nt in JSON schemas.

Semantix offers a different and more cost-effective solution. Instead of using JSON schemas, Semant
ix represents classes, enums, and objects in a more textual manner, reducing the number of tokens and lowering inference
 costs. Additionally, Semantix leverages Python's built-in typing system with minor modifications to provide meaning to 
parameters, function signatures, classes, enums, and functions. This approach eliminates the need for unnecessary Pydant
ic models and various classes for different prompting methods. Semantix also makes it easy for developers to create GenA
I-powered functions.

### Target Audience

Semantix is designed for developers who have worked with libraries like Langc
hain and DSPy and are tired of dealing with Pydantic models and JSON schemas. It is also ideal for those who want to add
 AI features to existing or new applications without learning extensive new libraries.

### Comparison

Semantix support
s multimodal inputs, allowing you to use images and videos effortlessly. Unlike other libraries, Semantix requires minim
al code changes to achieve excellent results.

```
Hello everyone , I'm currently learning Langgraph and trying to create a Github Agent which takes in a natural language 
query like 'Frontend developer based in India skilled in NextJS' and generates query parameters that will be used to sea
rch using Github User Search API .

Langchain does not have any tool for this use case , so I'm trying to develop my own
 .

For the project I'm developing , I'm following hierarchical agent architecture .

You can see my 2 tools below i.e.q
uery\_param\_generator tool and fetch\_users tool and their respective agent nodes i.e. query\_param\_generator\_node an
d fetch\_users\_node :

    from langchain_core.tools import tool

ate
    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
    import requests
    import functools
    from langgraph.prebuilt imp

    u/tool('query_param_generator')
    def query_param_generator(query:str):
        '
''
        Takes a natural language query as input and returns the appropriate query parameters based on the rules defin
ed in system_message
        '''
    
        query_gen_system = '''
        Strictly follow all the rules below to gene
rate query parameters for GitHub User Search . Ensure all rules are followed to generate accurate search queries.
      
  Only return the query , no extra information .
        # GitHub User Search - Query Parameter Generation Rules
    
  
      The following guidelines define how to construct query parameters for the GitHub User Search. Ensure all rules are
 followed to generate accurate search queries.
    
        # Overview
    
        1. Search Scope: Applies to public p
ersonal GitHub accounts (not organizations).
        2. Query Components: Queries can include:
        3. Keywords: For 
general information like usernames, names, emails, and bios.
        4. Qualifiers: For searching specific fields.
     
   5. Sort Parameters: Optional but can be added for ordering results.
        6. Case Sensitivity: Keywords are case-in
sensitive.
        7. Result Limit: The search returns the first 1000 results, sorted by best match (by default).
    
 
       # Qualifiers & Usage
    
        Each qualifier targets a specific field in the GitHub user data. These cannot b
e mixed with regular keywords.
    
        user:NAME: Matches exact usernames.
        Example: user:braingain
    
   
     in:login: Searches within usernames (non-exact matches allowed).
        Example: braingain in:login
    
        i
n:email: Searches within users' email addresses.
        Example: irina in:email
    
        in:name: Searches within u
sers' full names.
        Example: Irina in:name
    
        fullname:NAME: Similar to in:name, searches users' full na
mes.
        Example: fullname:john smith
    
        location:NAME: Searches users based on location.
        Example:
 location:Boston
    
        language:NAME: Finds users based on the primary language of their public repositories.
   
     Example: language:python
    
        repos:n: Searches users by the number of public repositories.
        Example
: repos:>1000
    
        followers:n: Searches users by the number of followers.
        Example: followers:>1000
    

        created:DATE: Finds users by their GitHub account creation date.
        Example: created:>2020-01-01
    
    
    is:sponsorable: Finds users with a GitHub Sponsors profile.
        Example: is:sponsorable
    
        sort:: Sort
s users based on specific attributes.
        Example: repos:>10000 sort:followers
    
        # Boolean Operators
    
    You can combine keywords and qualifiers using Boolean operators to refine the search. Follow these rules:
    
     
   AND (implied): Combining two different qualifiers or a qualifier and a keyword automatically implies AND.
        Exa
mple: location:'San Francisco' language:python (Finds users in San Francisco who primarily use Python).
    
        OR:
 Explicitly use OR between keywords or in: qualifiers only. For other qualifiers, using the same qualifier twice implies
 OR.
        Example: 'front-end developer' OR 'ui developer'
        Example: location:'new jersey' location:'new york'
 (Finds users in either New Jersey or New York).
    
        NOT (-): Use the minus sign (-) to exclude certain terms o
r qualifiers.
        Example: location:iceland -location:Reykjavik (Finds users in Iceland but not Reykjavik).
    
   
     # Key Limitations & Constraints
    
        Character Limit: Queries must not exceed 256 characters.
    
        
No Parentheses: Do not use parentheses in queries.
    
        AND/OR/NOT Limits: You cannot use more than five AND, OR
, or NOT operators in a single query.
        For example: location:'silicon valley' -language:java -language:c++ -langu
age:python -language:javascript -language:html is valid (5 negations).
        Special Notes on Combining Operators
    

        AND is implied for combining qualifiers and keywords but cannot be used explicitly with certain fields like loc
ation, language, etc.
    
        OR cannot be used explicitly between different qualifiers.
        Example: fullname:
irina user:braingain is interpreted as AND, while fullname:irina OR user:braingain is invalid.
    
        You cannot c
ombine keywords and qualifiers in OR statements.
        Example: language:java OR 'java developer' is invalid, while la

this setup works but can only build basic queries , you can see
 that I've written all the rules for building the query parameters in the system prompt , but still I'm not getting perf

Thanks

```
Hi everyone, 

I recently got a job at a small company that wants to deploy an RAG application on premises for its clien
ts. This company hasn't really done any AI use cases before, although does have some data analytics products in their do
main. The hiring manager wants me to develop their application as a RnD project from the ground up. That means choosing 
an open-source LLM and deploying it on-premise and open-source orchestrators like langchain along with other components 
of a gen AI platform along with the hardware specs needed to run such a platform on-premises. 

I have some experience w
ith LLMs in a hobby project in the Azure cloud and langchain along with a previous job in traditional ML where the infra
structure and server were already set up. But I have never done something of this scale where I had to design the system
 and also choose the infrastructure and hardware requirements along with LLMOps down the line.  

Can someone please gui
de me in going about how to get something of this scale setup? What factors should I consider and if any resources can h
elp in the usecase?

```
Hi,

I'm new to this AI world so consider I might be missing some context or not fully understanding something as of yet
.  
Having said that, I was developing an application which generates specific content as I request it to do so. For thi
s project I'm using langchain as a framework and gemini as the LLM. I'm also using RAG technique to retrieve relevant da
ta and use my own custom context.  
I have a simple [main.py](http://main.py) which has 2 messages, one for invoking and
 the other one for building the classic pipe or rag chain as I understand this flow is called.  
That pipeline looks som
ething like this:

`pipeline = (`  
`{'context': my_context,`  
`'query': RunnablePassthrough()}`  
`| prompt`  
`| llm`
  
`| StrOutputParser()`  
`)`

So my doubt came when I needed to change the parsing of the output the LLM was returning
 me. I needed to structure the data in a JSON with some specific types and I've realized that I needed to add that chang
e to the *Prompt.*  
To me this didn't make sense at all since I understood the last call of the pipeline, in this case 
a simple string, was the way to parse the output. To my surprise I've encountered that I needed to add format instructio
ns within the prompt.  
On the prompting side I have something like this:

    parser = JsonOutputParser(pydantic_object
=MyObjectTemplate)
    
    return PromptTemplate(
        template=MY_PROMPT_TEMPLATE,
        input_variables=['query'
],
        partial_variables={'format_instructions': parser.get_format_instructions()},
    )

What I don't understand a
t all is why the line JsonOutputParser(pydantic\_object=MyObjectTemplate) cannot or else why it shouldn't go within the 
last step of the pipeline. I've tried to do so but partial\_variables parameter is required to create the PromptTemplate
 object.  
It's unclear to me so far why If I only want to change the way the LLM responds, I need to change the Prompt.


Can somebody help me understand how to accomplish a refactor to decoupled these two things or enlighten me if there's 
something I'm understanding incorrectly?

Thanks in advance.

```
I'm working on a RAG project involving numerous PDFs and documents.

The documents frequently include screenshots that v
isually illustrate the surrounding text. Given the abundance of these screenshots and their high level of detail, I'm co
ncerned that using a multimodal model to describe the images might be both costly and potentially inaccurate.

As an alt
ernative, I'm considering using image embedding techniques with some form of positional referencing or indexing. I'm int
erested in finding valuable examples or resources that implement this approach, particularly using Langchain or other si
milar frameworks.

Additionally, I'm curious if certain vector databases are better suited for this specific use case. A
ny insights or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

```
I use crawling quite a bit for different parts of my job and have used platforms like scraperapi as well as apis from sc
rapy and others. In recent times i tried firecrawl as well [r.jina.ai](http://r.jina.ai) as well - for crawling. However
, they were all less than perfect. So I defined my own way of crawling and figured this can be quite straight forward..


Basically you can provide a json for what you'd like to have and then ask openai or claude with a url to convert it to 
the provided json - this will convert any website into a json format. 

Now instead of doing it again and again with llm
, you can ask llm to write a code that produces the json output you are expecting given the website.. and you get a code
 that works perfectly and if there are errors you can ask llm to correct it. 

It works quite well for me .. I put up th
e code here [https://github.com/alinaqi/dynamic\_crawler](https://github.com/alinaqi/dynamic_crawler) for anyone who may
 find it interesting.. 

Happy to hear from others on what they think about the approach.

Ok, so I am currently trying to build support chatbot with following technicalities 
1. FastAPI for web server(Need to m
ake it faster)
2. Qdrant as Vector Data Base(Found it to be the fastest amongst Chromadb, Elastic Search and Milvus)
3. 
MongoDB for storing all the data and feedback.
4. Semantic chunking with max token limit of 512.
5. granite-13b-chat-v2 
as the LLM(I know it's not good but I have limited options available)
6. The data is structured as well as unstructured.
 Thinking of having involving GraphRAG with current architecture.
7. Multiple data sources stored in multiple collection
s of vector database because I have implemented an access control.
8. Using mongoengine currently as a ORM. If you know 
something better please suggest.
9. Using all-miniLM-l6-v2 as vector embedding currently but planning to use stella_en_4
00M_v5.
10. Using cosine similarity to retrieve the documents.
11. Using BLEU, F1 and BERT score for automated evaluatio
n based on golden answer.
12. Using top_k as 3.
13. Currently using basic question answering prompt but want to improve 
it. Any tips? Also heard about Automatic Prompt Evaluation.
14. Currently using custom code for everything. Looking to u
se Llamaindex or Langchain for this. 
15. Right now I am not using any AI Agent, but I want to know your opinions. 
16. 
It's a simple RAG framework and I am working on improving it.
17. I haven't included reranker but I am planning to do so
 too.

I think I mentioned pretty much everything I am using for my project. So please share your suggestions, comments 
and reviews for the same. Thank you!!

Are Agents just simple rules? Are Agents just enhanced reasoning? The answer is yes and no. Yes, in the sens
e that agents have simple rules and can sometimes enhance reasoning capabilities compared to a single prompt. But No in 
the sense that agents can have a much more diverse functionality like using specific tools, summarizing, or even followi
ng a particular style. In this blog, we look into how to set up these agents in a hierarchal manner just like running a 
small team of Authors, researchers, and supervisors.

[**How To Build Hierarchical Multi-Agent Systems?**](https://mediu

**TextGrad
**. It is a powerful framework performing automatic “differentiation” via text. **It backpropagates textual feedback pro
vided by LLMs to improve individual components of a compound AI system.** In this framework, LLMs provide rich, general,
 natural language suggestions to optimize variables in computation graphs, ranging from code snippets to molecular struc
tures. TextGrad showed effectiveness and generality across various applications, from question-answering and molecule op
timization to radiotherapy treatment planning.

[**TextGrad: Improving Prompting Using AutoGrad**](https://medium.com/ai
guys/textgrad-controlling-llm-behavior-via-text-2a82e2073d10?sk=3633a9aa63b884c97469bce659265921)

The addition of RAG t
o LLMs was an excellent idea. It helped the LLMs to become more specific and individualized. Adding new components to an
y system leads to more interactions and its own sets of problems. Adding RAG to LLMs leads to several problems such as h
ow to retrieve the best content, what type of prompt to write, and many more.

In this blog, we are going to combine the
 **LangChain RAG with DSPy**. We deep dive into how to evaluate the RAG pipeline quantitatively using **RAGAs** and how 
to create a system where instead of manually tweaking prompts, we let the system figure out the best prompt.

Build LangChain RAG With DSPy?**](https://medium.com/aiguys/how-to-build-langchain-rag-with-dspy-ce9154fbafaa?sk=b41d104

As the field of natural language processing (NLP) advances, the evaluation of large language
 models (LLMs) like GPT-4 becomes increasingly important and complex. Traditional metrics such as accuracy are often ina
dequate for assessing these models’ performance because they fail to capture the nuances of human language. In this arti
cle, we will explore why evaluating LLMs is challenging and discuss effective methods like BLEU and ROUGE for a more com
prehensive evaluation.

# AI Monthly News

# AI Act enters into force

On 1 August 2024, th
e European Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) enters into force. The Act aims to foster responsible artificial intelli
gence development and deployment in the EU. The AI Act introduces a uniform framework across all EU countries, based on 
a forward-looking definition of AI and a risk-based approach:

* **Minimal risk:** most AI systems such as spam filters 
and AI-enabled video games face no obligation under the AI Act, but companies can voluntarily adopt additional codes of 
conduct.
* **Specific transparency risk:** systems like chatbots must clearly inform users that they are interacting wit
h a machine, while certain AI-generated content must be labelled as such.
* **High risk:** high-risk AI systems such as 
AI-based medical software or AI systems used for recruitment must comply with strict requirements, including risk-mitiga
tion systems, high-quality of data sets, clear user information, human oversight, etc.
* **Unacceptable risk:** for exam
ple, AI systems that allow “social scoring” by governments or companies are considered a clear threat to people’s fundam
ental rights and are therefore banned.

# California AI bill SB-1047 sparks fierce debate, Senator likens it to ‘Jets vs. Sharks’ feud


**Key Aspects of SB-1047:**

* Regulation Scope: Targets “frontier” AI models, defined by their immense computational t
raining requirements (over 10²⁶ operations) or significant financial investment (>$100 million).
* Compliance Requiremen
ts: Developers must implement safety protocols, including the ability to immediately shut down, cybersecurity measures, 
and risk assessments, before model deployment.
* Whistleblower Protections: Encourages reporting of non-compliance or ri
sks by offering protection against retaliation.
* Safety Incident Reporting: Mandates reporting AI safety incidents with
in 72 hours to a newly established Frontier Model Division.
* Certification: Developers need to certify compliance, pote
ntially under penalty of perjury in earlier drafts, though amendments might have altered this.

**Pros:**

* Safety Firs
t: Prioritizes the prevention of catastrophic harms by enforcing rigorous safety standards, potentially safeguarding aga
inst AI misuse or malfunction.
* Incentivizes Responsible Development: By setting high standards for AI model training, 
the company encourages developers to think critically about the implications of their creations.
* Public Trust: Enhance
s public confidence in AI by ensuring transparency and accountability in the development process.

**Cons:**

* Innovati
on Stagnation: Critics argue it might stifle innovation, especially in open-source AI, due to the high costs and regulat
ory burdens of compliance.
* Ambiguity: Some definitions and requirements might be too specific or broad, leading to leg
al challenges or unintended consequences.
* Global Competitiveness: There’s concern that such regulations could push AI 
development outside California or the U.S., benefiting other nations without similar restrictions.
* Implementation Chal
lenges: The practicalities of enforcing such regulations, especially the “positive safety determination,” could be compl
ex and contentious.

# MORE OpenAI drama

OpenAI co-founder John
 Schulman has left the company to join rival AI startup Anthropic, while OpenAI president and co-founder Greg Brockman i
s taking an extended leave until the end of the year. Schulman, who played a key role in creating the AI-powered chatbot
 platform ChatGPT and led OpenAI’s alignment science efforts, stated his move was driven by a desire to focus more on AI
 alignment and hands-on technical work. Peter Deng, a product manager who joined OpenAI last year, has also left the com

So me and my friend completed the ML and DL specialization by AndrewNg, and were just gonna get started on a project. We
 decided to make a academic assistant. So basically what this does is a user can upload a PDF,text file or any other sup
ported media and the can ask questions related to it's contents. The main objective being making learning quick given la
rger documents.

The pipeline we decided is pretty standard for such a project.

1. Split the text into chunks
2. Genera
te embeddings of the chunks
3. Store the chunks in a vector DB
4. Find the top K similar chunks to the query 
5. Retriev
e context and feed it into a LLM for an answer.

So I looked up for a library and framework to use and decided on langch
ain. We haven't decided on an LLM yet but want to run it locally so no OpenAI please. 

Since this is gonna be out first
 AI project confidence is low. I would really appreciate any heads up on the issues we may face, any suggestions on libr
aries,frameworks or models will be really helpful as well. 

Appreciate any resourceful comment 😊
