Hi all,

1. I am creating a LLM-based chatbot on electric motors. 
2. In this RAG model, I have used \~500 Research pape
rs on Electric motors
3. I'm struggling to sort the final answer of llm by date as in , for any query the model should s
elect the information in most recent research paper and not the outdated one.
4. I'm using Pinecone , vectorDB and openA
I as llm. there is option to filter by metadata but not 'sorting' by date.

Has someone already implemented this or know
 any approach to tackle this issue?

```
Hi all,

I’m using lang chain js, and most examples I find are using openAI but I’m using llama.
I managed to get a simp
le text file embedded and can ask basic questions, but most of the time the model just spits out the prompt.

I’m using 
just cpu at the moment so it’s very slow but that’s ok. I’m experimenting with loading txt files, csv files etc but clea
rly it’s not going well, I can ask some very simple question but most of the time it fails.

My understanding is;

1. Lo
ad model 
2. Load data and chunk (csv file for example. I chunk usually with something like 200 and by separators /n
3. 
Load embedding (I’m supposed to load llama gguf model right? The same one as in step 1? As a parameter in llamaCppEmbedd
ings)
4. Vector store in memory 
5. Create chain and ask question
6. Console log answer

Is this concept correct and do 
you have any tips to help me get better results.

Thank you

Hi all!

A couple of days ago, when I was scrolling down Hacker News, exploring news about OpenAI and the latest specula

nversation.

Using streamlit, langchain and openai functions I managed to create a first version of this chat (I still h
ave to add RAG for news analysis and test other types of LLMs).

Hey everyone 👋

So many things happening in recent weeks it's almost impossible to keep up! All good things for us devel
opers, builders, and AI enthusiasts.

As you know, many people are experimenting with GPTs to build their own custom Cha
tGPT. I've built a couple of bots just for fun but quickly realized that I needed more control over a few things. Luckil
y, just a few days after the release of OpenAI GPTs, the LangChain team released OpenGPTs, an open-source alternative!


So, I’ve been reading about OpenGPTs and wrote a short introductory blog post comparing it to GPTs so that anyone like m
e who's just getting started can quickly get up to speed. 

Here it is: [https://www.gettingstarted.ai/introduction-over
view-open-source-langchain-opengpts-versus-openai-gpts/](https://www.gettingstarted.ai/introduction-overview-open-source

```
Tous les exemples de Langchain et sur des câlins créent de la mémoire en collant toute l'historique dans chaque invite. 
Cela semble violer assez rapidement la longueur d'invite d'entrée maximale. Et c'est cher. Chatgpt utilise-t-il quelque 
chose de révolutionnaire? Il oublie tout lorsque vous créez une nouvelle session, donc il «sent» qu'il utilise également
 le convo comme mémoire.

Mais alors la question; Comment dépassent-ils les limites rapides? Chunking n'aide pas car il 
n'obtient toujours pas de contexte dans ce cas entre les invites. Peut-être qu'ils posent la même question avec des morc
eaux différents à plusieurs reprises et demandent ensuite un résultat final?

Toutes mes excuses Si cela a été répondu q
uelque part, je ne le trouve pas du tout et tous les exemples utilisent le même type de mémoire historique.

I'm looking to process an entire PDF document.  The document is mostly standard text and 6-20 paragraphs.  Some sections
 are larger than the token limits. I want to re-write or pull info from the PDF.  This would require me to use each chun
k of text from the PDF to extract the data I'm looking for.

At first I was thinking of using Langchain for a summarizat
ion chain but I'm not sure this is my correct path.

I do not really want to map\_reduce because the initial data is imp
ortant and I'm slightly fearful of losing data before processing to get extracted info.  The summarization chains don't 
really allow for custom prompts like 'give me all statistical data from this text' (or if it does, I missed it).

Now I 
am thinking of just chunking the PDF and using a straight chat to process each chunk and combine the results at the end.


Looking for some advice on how to tackle this and what approach you'd use?

 is pretty bad across types, likely due to the documents themselves being overly long for the embedding and being simila
r on average.  I would resort to splitting and chunking to shrink the documents, but the challenge is that an element at
 the very top or bottom of a document may have relevance to the complete opposite end; it benefits the LLM QA component 
to have that entire context to answer queries.

*Without reworking document ingestion, my solution is to classify the us
er's prompt into one of those metadata categories (sports, medicine, history) using a few-shot learning prompt.  Then, u
se that classification as a metadata filter in a retriever so only that type is in consideration for the embedding ANN l
ookup.*  **Is there a name for this kind of pattern?  And does anyone have other recommendations?  Obvious downsides (be
yond the need for a second LLM call)?**

**I understand how to implement this, but does LangChain have an existing class
 (or classes) best suited for this?**

```
Recently, I used Google Docs' spell check, which seems to use an outdated, small language model. Its suggestions made me
 realize that advanced models like GPT-4 and even 3.5 are superior. I'm considering using the API for spell checking by 
submitting text for error detection. However, without precise prompt engineering, the output can be suboptimal, and usin
g techniques like chain of thought can introduce fluff content or hallucinations. I'm curious if there's an existing lib
rary or method to streamline this, perhaps by having the model rewrite the text correctly in a json format and then comp
aring it to the original to highlight only the changes. Any advice or solutions would be greatly appreciated.

t
he product name is like 'iphone 4', 'iphone 5', 'iphone 6', ..., 'pixel 4', 'pixel 5', ....  


when a user ask 'what is
 the price of the product named iphone?' , both of agent or SqlDatabaseChain will generate   
an sql statement like:  



select price from product where product\_name = 'iphone'.  
which will return no results.  


what I want is, the agent
 could suggest that ' I did not find the product iphone, but found some similar names, do you mean iphone4, iphone5 ...'
  


Because sometimes the user could not remember the precise product name, if the agent could ask for clarification, t

It would be better if user ask ' what is the price of iphone 4',  the agent '
know' iphone4 is a product name, rather than manufacturer.

```
I have worked with LangChain a good bit now and one of the main benefits is that it makes LLM APIs stateful.

What I mea
n by 'stateful' is that the the hidden state of the transformer is preserved. This is, of course, done by LangChain by s
aving the entire chat history you've had so far, and resending that entire history to the LLM API every time a new input
 is sent to the LLM.

Now the question is - why aren't LLM APIs themselves stateful? It seems like a massive use of comp
ute to recompute every single input token every single time. Why doesn't OpenAI (and others) simply give me a session id
 and save the state of the LLM on their side, so I can just follow up with my latest input string (alongside the unique 
session id), as opposed to having to resend \*the entire conversation\* every single time I make an API call?

This woul
d drastically reduce latency, reduce the load on their servers, etc. I understand it's slightly more complicated and res
ource intense to do so, but is it really that hard? I'd pay way more per in/out token for a stateful API.

So why aren't
 they stateful? What am I missing?

I have about a half million pdfs I need to summarize. Very wide range of types: invoices, diagrams, contracts, emails, l

Which is... woof. Something else. I've been trying f
or many hours now to figure out a service/combination thereof that can get me there, but I'm seriously struggling. The *
ideal* solution would be to throw the pdfs in and have it return a csv with dates and summaries, maybe parsed out email 
heading info.

I'm currently running these pdfs through Acrobat OCR now, which its own special hell.

I've tried myriad 
local and webhosted solutions. The BEST results in what is almost the perfect system for this I found on https://docalys
is.com/. Good text results, works in batches, BUT I can only upload a single document at a time. They have a service to 
do batch processing and so I'm waiting to hear from them now. I imagine at the scale I need it's expensive.

I also got 
this solution working: https://github.com/mayooear/gpt4-pdf-chatbot-langchain. Seemed solid, I was able to upload a thou
sand pdfs in a single go, but it would keep returning information from only 2-3 documents. Upload 5? Results for 2-3. Up
load a thousand? Results for 2-3. My uneducated guess is that it's hitting the OpenAI API token limit, but maybe not?

I
 know it's possible, just not whether it's feasible for an end user.

```
Hey there, Redditors! 

I'm back with the latest installment on creating dependable AI data pipelines for real-world pro
duction. 

If you've been following along, you know I'm on a mission to move beyond the '[thin OpenAI wrapper](https://t
opoteretes.notion.site/Going-beyond-Langchain-Weaviate-and-towards-a-production-ready-modern-data-platform-7351d77a1eba4
0aab4394c24bef3a278?pvs=4)' trend and tackle the challenges of building robust data pipelines. 

With 18 months of hands
-on experience and many user interviews, I realized that with the probabilistic nature of systems, we need better\_testi
ng.gpt:

  
**1. As you build you should test**  
The world of AI is a fast-moving one, and we've realized that just wor
king on systems is not an optimal design choice. By the time your product ships, it might already be using outdated tech
nology. So, what's the lesson here? Embrace change, test along, but be prepared to switch pace.  
**2. No Best Practices
 Yet for RAGs**  
In this rapidly evolving landscape, there are no established best practices. You'll need to make educa
ted bets on tools and processes, knowing that things will change. With the RAG testing tool, I tried allowing for testin
g many potential parameter combinations **automatically**  
**3. Testing Frameworks**  
If your generative AI product do
esn't have users giving feedback, then you are building in isolation. I used [Deepeval](https://github.com/confident-ai/
deepeval) to generate test sets, and they will soon support synthetic test set generation  
**4. Infographics only go so
 far**  
AI researchers and data scientists, while brilliant, end up in a loop of pursuing Twitter promotional content. 
New ways are promoted via new content pieces, but ideally, we need something above simple tracing but less than full-fle
dged analytics. To do this, I stored test outputs in Postgres and created a Superset instance to visualize the results  

**5. Bridging the Gap between VectorDBs**  
There's a noticeable number of Vector DBs. To ensure smooth product develop
ment, we need to be able to switch to best best-performing one, especially since user interviews signal that they might 
start deteriorating after loading 50 million rows

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Relevance Extraction in RAG Pipelines ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/17k6iha/d_relevance_extraction_in_rag_pipelines/) , 2023-11-26-0911
```
I came across this interesting problem in RAG, what I call **Relevance Extraction**.

After retrieving relevant document
s (or chunks), these chunks are often large and may contain several portions **irrelevant** to the query at hand. Stuffi
ng the entire chunk into an LLM prompt impacts token-cost as well as response accuracy (distracting the LLM with irrelev
ant text), and and can also cause bumping into context-length limits.

So a critical step in most pipelines is **Relevan
ce Extraction**: use the LLM to extract **verbatim** only the portions relevant to the query. This is known by other nam
es, e.g. LangChain calls it Contextual Compression, and the RECOMP paper calls it Extractive Compression [https://twitte
r.com/manelferreira\_/status/1713214439715938528](https://twitter.com/manelferreira_/status/1713214439715938528)

Thinki
ng about how best to do this, I realized it is **highly inefficient** to simply ask the LLM to 'parrot' out relevant por
tions of the text: this is obviously slow, and also consumes valuable token generation space and can cause you to bump i
nto context-length limits (and of course is expensive, e.g. for gpt4 we know generation is 6c/1k tokens vs input cost of
 3c/1k tokens).

I realized the best way (or at least a good way) to do this is to **number** the sentences and have the
 LLM simply spit out the relevant sentence **numbers.** Langroid's unique Multi-Agent + function-calling architecture al
lows an elegant implementation of this, in the RelevanceExtractorAgent ([https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/
langroid/agent/special/relevance\_extractor\_agent.py](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/langroid/agent/spe
cial/relevance_extractor_agent.py)).  The agent annotates the docs with sentence numbers, and instructs the LLM to pick 
out the **sentence-numbers** relevant to the query, rather than whole sentences using a function-call (SegmentExtractToo
l [https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/langroid/agent/tools/segment\_extract\_tool.py](https://github.com/lan
groid/langroid/blob/main/langroid/agent/tools/segment_extract_tool.py)), and the agent's function-handler interprets thi
s message and strips out the indicated sentences by their numbers. To extract from a set of passages, langroid automatic
ally does this async + concurrently so latencies in practice are much, much lower than the sentence-parroting approach.


\[FD -- I am the lead dev of Langroid - [https://github.com/langroid/langroid](https://github.com/langroid/langroid))


I thought this **numbering** idea is a fairly obvious idea in theory, so I looked at LangChain's equivalent `LLMChainExt
ractor` (they call this Contextual Compression [https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data\_connection/retrievers/co
ntextual\_compression?ref=blog.langchain.dev](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/conte
xtual_compression?ref=blog.langchain.dev)) and was surprised to see it is the simple '**parrot**' method, i.e. the LLM w
rites out whole sentences verbatim from its input. I thought it would be interesting to compare Langroid vs LangChain, y
ou can see it in this Colab: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RDPCR2xNuBffcmpUuPIXYDRG3SXIJC5F](https://colab.r
esearch.google.com/drive/1RDPCR2xNuBffcmpUuPIXYDRG3SXIJC5F)

On the specific example in the notebook, the Langroid **num
bering** approach is 22x faster and 36% cheaper (with gpt4) than LangChain's **parrot** method (I promise this name is *
not* inspired by their logo :). See table below.

&#x200B;

I won
der if anyone had thoughts on relevance extraction, or other approaches. At the very least, I hope langroid's implementa
tion is useful to you -- you can use the `DocChatAgent.get_verbatim_extracts()` ([https://github.com/langroid/langroid/b
lob/main/langroid/agent/special/doc\_chat\_agent.py#L804](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/langroid/agent/

system or not.
