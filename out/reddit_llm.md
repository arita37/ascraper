Is there any way to persists the parent documents in the ParentDocumentRetrieval?  
All the tutorials I see use the InMe

```
I want to bind some functions into a llm, I'm using the ChatOpenAI wrapper to connect to a Ollama llama3 model locally, 
I have this code:

        options = ['FINISH'] + members
        function_def = {
            'name': 'route',
        
    'description': 'Select the next role',
            'parameters': {
                'title': 'routeSchema',
         
       'type': 'object',
                'properties': {
                    'next': {
                        'title': 
'Next',
                        'anyOf': [
                            {'enum': options},
                        ],
   
                 },
                },
                'required': ['next'],
            },
        }
        prompt = C
hatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
            [
                ('system', system_prompt),
                MessagesPlaceh
older(variable_name='messages'),
                (
                    'system',
                    'Given the conversa
tion above, who should act next?'
                    'Or should we FINISH?: select one of {options}
                )
 
           ]
        ).partial(options=str(options), team_members=','.join(members))
        
        # Bind the functio
n to the LLM, specify the function call, and parse the output as JSON
        return (
            prompt
            | 
llm.bind_functions(functions=[function_def], function_call='route')
            | JsonOutputFunctionsParser()
        )


This is the LLM I'm using:

    llm = ChatOpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', model='llama3', api_key='ollama'
)

However, I encounter the following issue:

langchain\_core.exceptions.OutputParserException: Could not parse function
 call: 'function\_call'

Could anyone help me here? Thanks :)

Hi Y'all,  
I encounter this issue with running langchain runnables and it can't get input\_schema. To replicate this us

Any leads on how to resolve this issue?

```
Hi everybody. I am trying to streaming the response of a langgraph. With astream\_events is it possible to choose in the
 metadata the node we want to stream the response, and in my case is of course the last node. The problem is that the ch
ain used in the last node has been built using runnable Parallel, because I needed to invoke multiple chains in parallel
. But what I am interested in is just the output of one of the chains. However the astream\_event applied on the last no
de streams out the output of the chains mixed. So I get the streaming of all the chain at the same time and it get messe
d up. Has anyone already tried to build a graph with parallel indipendent chains and used astream\_events on it??

all -  [ LangGraph Stability ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1e73gzj/langgraph_stability/) , 2024-07-20-0911
```
Is LangGraph production-ready?

I am finally seeing more documentation on checkpoint implementations, such as persistenc
e using PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis. Thanks a lot to the LangChain devs for the continued development of this open so
urce tool.

However, I notice that these implementations are mainly phrased as 'example' implementations. Does this mean
 they are not production ready?

Are checkpoints in a stable condition? I have been wanting to add an implementation mys
elf, but chalked it up to be something I'd have to spend considerable time implementing as the specifications is lengthy
. However, now I see the code for the core checkpoint usage has been updated recently, and even the implementations have
 new things like `write` and `channel`.

There are also other areas (comment sections under the notebooks) where someone
 states that `thread_ts` has been deprecated, and `checkpoint_id` is now being used. Yet, the notebook example implement
ations themselves still use `thread_ts`.

Finally, the behind the scenes of what is stored is a bit complicated to under
stand as well, without much explanations nor documentations. And even these base abstractions seem to be changing recent
ly. For example, the checkpointer implementations have some code 'for backward compatibility'.

If I were to maintain an
 implementation for another dialect (MariaDB, SQL Server, etc), changing it at such a dynamic pace would take more away 
from using LangGraph itself on my projects. Especially when the LangGraph changes are discovered when browsing the git h
istory, rather than the LangGraph blogs or documentations.

Can these be documented? It's a bit of a magic right now wit
h what is being stored unless one attempts to actually reverse engineer it. Again, I do not have an issue doing that; af
ter all, it is an open source tool. However, with the ever-changing seemingly silent changes, it will make it difficult 
to keep up.

Is LangGraph stable? Or still in heavy development?

```
You've probably heard about Mistral's groundbreaking release of Codestral Mamba, a 7B parameter model. But why all the h
ype over a 7B model when we have giants like GPT-4? Well, it's not just about size this time – it's about architecture. 
🔍

The **Transformer Dilemma:**

Transformers have been the cornerstone architecture for language models, powering every
thing from open-source LLMs to chatGPT and Claude.

However, they come with a significant drawback: as context expands, 
so does processing time (hello, quadratic bottleneck!).

Transformers are undeniably effective, storing every detail fro
m the past for theoretically perfect recall.

On the other hand, traditional RNN (Recurring Neural Networks)– forget a l
ot, retaining only a small portion in their hidden state and discarding the rest. This makes them highly efficient but l
ess effective since discarded information cannot be retrieved.

Finding the Sweet Spot - **Enter Mamba** 🐍.

Mamba belon
gs to a class of models known as State Space Models (SSMs). SSMs excel in understanding and predicting how systems (like
 cars) evolve based on measurable data.

Notably, Mamba offers comparable performance and scalability to Transformers bu
t crucially eliminates the quadratic bottleneck in the Attention Mechanism.

Language models are good at summarizing tex
t, though some details may be lost. However, summarizing other forms of content, like a two-hour movie, is trickier.

Th
is is where Mamba's long-term memory comes into play, enabling the model to retain important information.

Why should yo
u care? Mamba could be a game-changer for tasks requiring extensive context, like:

1. DNA processing 🧬

2. Report writi
ng 📚

3. Agents with long-term memory and goals 🤖(Mistral - Codestral Mamba)

how do you do it? I would like the reponse to be properly formatted in markdown for example. This does work somewhat but
 it still uses some non-unicode formatting for example: '\\( LAF,max \\geq 45 \\)' instead of using '≥'. Even with one-s
hot prompting it does not follow the instructions properly. 

  
Maybe there is another model that is trained on this ta

For those se
eing my post first time , Hi , I'm a web dev learning AI , currently developing a PDF RAG app.   
  
I want the answer t
o my queries should come from pdf only . If there is no answer for a query , AI should return something like ' Answer is
 not in the provided document ... etc ' .

current state of my app is that sometimes it fails to answer questions from m
y pdf which are present in the pdf and sometimes it answers general questions that it shouldn't answer .

I've a system 
prompt in which I asked AI to not give answers of any other questions outside pdf . 

But it's not working .

Now ,

Is 
my code OK ? What did I do wrong ?

Is system prompt alone not enough to stop RAG from giving answers to general questio
ns  ?

What is the way to stop it from answering general questions ? Do I need to use Agents for this ?

all -  [ PSA: LangGraph removed the support for self hosting ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1e6xli4/psa_langgraph_removed_the_support_for_self_hosting/) , 2024-07-20-0911
```
Heads up, folks! If you're considering LangGraph for your projects, especially for production, here's something you need
 to know. LangGraph has recently removed the option to self-host. This means you can only use their cloud platform from 
now on. 

Here is the commit where they removed instructions on how to self host from the readme: [https://github.com/la
ngchain-ai/langgraph-example/commit/215ef6eb2f653e46cfb442aeed2978c703781a01](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-
example/commit/215ef6eb2f653e46cfb442aeed2978c703781a01)

While it might seem convenient, there are some significant ris
ks and disadvantages you should consider.

First off, **data ownership**. When you use their cloud service, you're essen
tially handing over your data to them. This raises concerns about privacy and security, especially if you're dealing wit
h sensitive or proprietary information. You're trusting LangGraph to handle and protect your data properly, but you lose
 control over how it's stored and managed.

Secondly, you're **at the mercy of the platform**. If their service experien
ces downtime or technical issues, your system will be affected. This is a huge risk if you're running a production envir
onment where uptime is critical. Any changes they make to their service, pricing, or terms can impact you directly, and 
you have no say in the matter.

This also means that using the cloud version means you're **subject to their updates and
 changes**. They can roll out updates that might not align with your needs or even disrupt your existing setup. This lac
k of control can be frustrating, especially if your project relies on specific features or configurations.

Losing the a
bility to self-host means you sacrifice control over your data and are **fully dependent on their platform's reliability
 and policies**. If these risks are a concern for you, it might be worth looking into alternative solutions that offer s
elf-hosting options or more control over your production environment.

[There’s been a huge rise in papers on LLM-based agents in the two years,](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07864) showing obv
ious benefits in output quality and complexity of the task that can be handled. There are 2 obvious problems:

* Latency
: because agents are talking to each other — usually sequentially — output generation will take longer.
* Cost: much mor

But these are exactly the things GPT 4o
 Mini concerns itself with. I’m actually incorporating it right now into some preprocessing workflows we have at [adorno

**What did I build?**

I built a tool that’s like a “Chat with PDF” for software/API documentation. You can have an on d
emand RAG system up and running in a few seconds for any doc and you can share it with anyone. This came out of my exper
ience coding and realising how important it is, but its also pretty confusing and difficult if you’re someone new.

**Overview of Llama Index**

Llama Index is designed specifically for building search and retrieval applications. It pro
vides a simple interface for querying large language models (LLMs) and retrieving relevant documents. Llama Index excels
 in data indexing and retrieval, making it suitable for production-ready RAG applications.

# Key Features of Llama Inde
x

* **Data Indexing and Retrieval**: Llama Index is optimized for indexing and retrieving data efficiently. It converts
 documents into individual nodes for indexing, establishing relationships between these nodes to provide context for the
 information.
* **Simple Interface**: The framework offers a straightforward interface for querying LLMs and retrieving 
relevant documents, making it easy to use for developers.
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Llama Index provides components for 
evaluating RAG-related metrics, such as the retriever, query engine, and response generation

**Overview of Langchain**


Langchain is a more general-purpose framework that simplifies the development and deployment of LLM-powered application
s. It offers a modular and extensible architecture, empowering developers to combine LLMs with various data sources and 
services.

# Key Features of Langchain

1. **Modular Architecture**: Langchain's modular design allows developers to cre
ate diverse LLM architectures, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
2. **Out-of-the-Box Components**: La
ngchain provides a variety of out-of-the-box components, such as LangSmith, which offers basic organization and versioni
ng of prompts, facilitating the creation of complex AI workflows.

* **Evaluation Suite**: Langchain's LangSmith evaluat
or suite offers more options for general LLM tasks, though it is primarily used for tracing and debugging rather than ev
aluation

# Comparison of Llama Index and Langchain

|Feature|Llama Index|Langchain|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Focus|Data indexing and
 retrieval|General-purpose framework|
|Architecture|Specialized for search and retrieval|Modular and extensible|

Are you able to create a tool using create\_pandas\_dataframe\_agent?

I am looking to create a chat agent that will be 
able to tell if it should use the create\_pandas\_dataframe\_agent to answer data about specific data, or use a retrieva
l tool and RAG if that is the correct route to extract the desired data.

I have gotten the pandas agent and the retriev
al tool to work independently of each other, but can not get them to work as one agent. Is this the correct way of going
 about solving this problem? Is it even possible?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

```
I have two indexes with my pinecone vector databases, one has the sensitive and private data of my org, while other has 
embeddings related to open data.

I want to divert the IP address accordingly, if a user belongs to my org (which is not
ed because of particular IP address range) he must be directed to index which has private and org specific data, while a
 non-org user must be routed to different index which has public data.

Based on the above requirements I have two quest
ions :-

1. Can we achieve it without building and leveraging on AWS architectures AWS Sagemaker, if yes then how?

2. I
f we use AWS sagemaker and deploy this rag+llm model on AWS or build my model by using foundational model of AWS then ho
w can this be achieved.

 
Looking forward for the views.

Hi r/langchain,

Microsoft SharePoint is to enterprises what Google Drive is to consumers. Happy to share my work on an 
app template that makes it easy to build applications that deliver up-to-date answers using your RAG pipeline with Share
Point data. 

* Repo Link: [~https://pathway.com/developers/templates/enterprise\_rag\_sharepoint~](https://pathway.com/
developers/templates/enterprise_rag_sharepoint)

Thousands of employees at large corporations collaborate and make chang
es in the documents stored in Microsoft SharePoint folders – making it a valuable data source for dynamic RAG/Gen AI app
lications to boost productivity. 

However, existing connectors for SharePoint lack necessary security features. My temp
late covers:

* Real-Time Sync with changes in your SharePoint files, with the help of Pathway (link: [~Pathway Vector S
tore on LangChain~](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pathway/)).
* Step by step process 
to setup Entra ID and SSL authentication. 
* Security and Scalability, given the choice of frameworks and minimalistic a
rchitecture.
* Ease of Setup to help you run the app template in Docker within minutes.

I plan to further refine this b
y using:

* [~Adaptive RAG~](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/adaptive-rag): Implementing cost-effective strateg
ies without sacrificing accuracy.

Hello,

I have a document that explains finance policies and processes of some company. The goal is to build a chatbot u
sing RAG framework upon that document to serve employees who have queries related to financial issues.  
  
I got sample
 questions from stack-holders and I made them as a criteria to measure the chatbot performance. What I noticed is that s
ample questions are slightly complex and do not have direct answers in the document. The retrieved context via semantic 
similarity search does not get the desired part of the document so the answers are incorrect or misleading.   
  
So, I 
am wondering if the document is not suitable to answer user questions or not. How to measure the relevance of the docume
nt content to user questions?! what kind of preprocessing I  may do on the document to fix that issue.  
  
What made me
 more confused is that when I uploaded the document on chatgpt and tried to ask the same questions, it was able to answe
r questions correctly. This made me think of the chatgpt method to process documents and answer questions based on them?
 I think it is not using embedding and similarity search as I do!

I have tried different techniques like parent documen
t retrieval and multi-representation indexing but still have the problem of capturing wrong parts of the document!

I am
 using OpenAi Embedding and gpt-3.5-turbo.

You can even do your own setu

We completely underestimated this one tbh, thought it would be much more straight forward. But we've done it now and doc

A bit of context, we're building

 It needs to be cost effective and efficient, so we thought about how to do it and tested a couple other ways.

deeplearning -  [ Llama 3 not running on GPU ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1dptxsr/llama_3_not_running_on_gpu/) , 2024-07-20-0911
```
I dont know much theory about RAG but i need to implement it for a project.  
**I want to run llama3 on my GPU to get fa
ster results.**

`from langchain_community.llms import Ollama`  
`llm = Ollama(model='llama3',num_gpu=1)`  
`def generat
e_response(prompt, similar_jobs):`  
`descriptions = '\n\n'.join([job['Description'] for job in similar_jobs])`  
`augme
nted_prompt = f'{prompt}\n\nHere are some job recommendations based on your query:\n{descriptions}'`  
`for chunks in ll
m.stream(augmented_prompt):`  
`print(chunks, end='')`

I am giving llama3 my *'user prompt'* and top 5 nearest *'simila
r\_jobs'* using cosine similarity.  
This code goes not use my GPU but my CPU and RAM usage is high.

**My gpu usage is 
0%** , i have a Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Laptop GPU GDDR6 @ 4GB (128 bits)
