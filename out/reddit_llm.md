I am a US Computer Science student looking to graduate in Spring 2025. I am currently applying for new-grad/entry-level 
positions, primarily in software engineering but also other related roles. Just looking for some general feedback on res
ume to help improve my interview chances as much as possible, thank you! :)

```
I am building an e-commerce comparison bot. I am scraping data from leading e-commerce stores. But I am confused how to 
proceed?
My best idea is turning all data into vector embeddings and implementing RAG on it.
But i think it would be rea
lly costly and I might not be able to add changes immediately. Any other way to do this? Without using vector db or any 
other pipeline I could use?

```
I'm trying to extract the attributes of product from their descriptions like color, volume etc. Normal BERT QA models we
ren't performing well due to bad descriptions. So, I did a small experiment using search tools and agent executor from l
angchain. The results were much better.

Now, I want to implement this on a large scale (a few million datapoints). My c
oncerns are:

1. Latency : Each request takes a few secs and doing this for a million records is a long process. Not to 
mention, I have to give a few shot prompting and the prompt is kinda huge.

2. Robustness: Sending so many api (both ope
nai and search api)  request can crash my code

Is there anything that I can do to make this work in a fast andstable ma
nner? Will LangGraph help? Am I even on the right track?

Thanks!

all -  [ How do you like AWS Textract for document parsing? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1f0wd3u/how_do_you_like_aws_textract_for_document_parsing/) , 2024-08-26-0911
```
Document parsing is one of the bigger problems in the RAG domain. There are some great services out there like unstructu
red, LlamaParse and LLMWhisperer. 

One service that does not get mentioned a lot but seems quite powerful, too, is AWS 
Textract. Our first tests look quite promising, we have lots of tabular data to extract which it does quite well.

What 
is your experience with it? Is it a worthy competitor to the aforementioned tools?

RAG newbie requesting help from all you pros hereüôå Trying to implement RAG based on an excel spreadsheet (30k x 6). Usin
g llamaparse from llamaindex. My question is that after the indexing step (which takes a sweet while) - where does all t

ll the indexed items but not sure how llamaindex stores all the indexed info for me to review. 

The implementation code
 (for indexing) is: 
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex

qu

Hello everyone!
I recently started learning go and made some simple CLI tools using cobra. Recently I got a project idea
 where I would want to have a RAG implementation for users directories and allow users to query them. 

Now I want to im
plement this directly using the CLI, as a start I was thinking to save the vector database directly on the local machine
 of the user but will probably move it to the cloud later. 

But considering the complexity of this and also given that 
files and the content of those files may change often, I have a few questions:

1) First and foremost, how can I even im
plement this? I am also new to RAG and have only implemented it using libraries like langchain.

2) Is it really feasibl
e to do this? And should I even give it a try?

3) Is there anything like this which already exists?

Thankyou!

```
Hello everyone,

I am working on a chatbot project for an e-commerce site specialising in the sale of gourds. My goal is
 to create a virtual assistant named Max, which helps users find products and answer their questions by using data store
d in a vector database, Pinecone.

Problem:

Setting up the Chatbot Instructions: I have defined a personalised prompt w
ith a system message for the chatbot to follow specific instructions (for example, 'You are Max, an assistant in an e-co
mmerce store that sells gourds...'). However, I have difficulty formatting this prompt correctly so that the chatbot und
erstands the questions asked by the user and responds contextually.

What I have already tried:

‚Ä¢	 Using LangChain's Ch
atPromptTemplate: I formatted the prompt using ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages to structure the roles of messages ('sys
tem', 'human', 'ai'). The chatbot follows the system's instructions well, but it does not seem to integrate user data in
to its responses.

‚Ä¢	 Conversation History Management: I have put in place a mechanism to keep a conversation history, b
ut this does not seem to improve the chatbot's responses that remain generic.

Questions:

1.	 How can I better integrat
e a personalised prompt so that the chatbot correctly answers users' questions while tracking the stored data?

2.	 What
 is the best practice to ensure that the chatbot effectively uses the recovered data from Pinecone and the prompt provid
ed to generate a good response?

Any feedback, advice or code examples would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you very muc

```
I‚Äôm working on implementing a RAG workflow for CSV files that contain Arabic text, which requires UTF-8 encoding. The wo
rkflow includes:



1. Loading CSV Files (Partition\_CSV)

2. Chunking

3. Defining Embeddings

4. Converting to Vector 
Embeddings, in Vector DB (Postgres-PG Vector)

5. Defining Prompt

6.  then defining LLM

I tested this successfully wit
h an Small English CSV file, but encountered issues when loading the Arabic CSV file. The problem seems to be with the \
`Partition\_CSV\` function, which lacks an option for encoding. Without encoding, Arabic fields convert to question mark
s, leading to LLM not recognizing the content and responding with 'I don't know.'

I attempted to use \`CSVLoader\`, whi
ch offers an encoding option, but it still doesn‚Äôt handle the Arabic text correctly. As a result output remains same, an
swer to any question I don't Know.

Is there any  alternatives to resolve this issue.

We have a MessageGraph for an LLMCompiler implementation and as expected we pass a users's question when running invoke 
as a list of HumanMessage objects(which are mapped to a default 'messages' key and passed to prompt templates), this wor
ks fine for simple use cases but now we need to pass an additional piece of information/context at invoke time(not at gr
aph  building time), we did something similar with a react agent and it was very easy passing a dictionary similar to `i
nvoke({'messages':input, 'context':context})`. But for MessageGraph this did not work, it looks as the list of messages 
passed when you run `invoke(messages)` is automatically mapped in the prompt to the 'messages' key and no other inputs c
an be added, I tried passing a dicionary  `invoke({'messages':messages, 'context':context})` and it did not work, failed
 with error:

     Message dict must contain 'role' and 'content' keys, got {'messages':messages,'context':context}

```
I know exactly how to build an awesome RAG. It‚Äôs as easy as a pie.

First, prepare your data. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre using smt
h like [unstructured.io](http://unstructured.io), hi\_res option. Your, oh, about 400 pdf files will be processed in jus
t a week or so, maybe a bit more‚Ä¶ No biggie.

Make sure to use some smart chunking. Smth semantic, with embedings from O
penAI. I mean, come on, even a kid knows that.

But! Data prep doesn't stop there! You want it awesome,right? Every chun
k needs to go through some LLM magic. Analyze it, enrich it so that every chunk is like Scrooge McDuck diving into his m
oney bin. Keywords, summarization, all that jazz. Pick a pricey LLM, don‚Äôt be stingy. You want awesome, don‚Äôt you?

Ok, 
now for search. Simple stuff. Every query needs to be rephrased by LLM, like, 5-7 times, maybe 10. Less is pointless. So
 - each query will give you 10 new ones,but what a bunch!

Then, take them all into vector search. And the results? You 
guessed it! Straight into Cohere reranker! We‚Äôre going for awesome, remember? Don‚Äôt forget to merge the results.

And no
w, for the final touch - LLM on the output. Here is my suggestion: pick a few models, let each one do its job. Then, use
 yet another model to pick the best one. Or, you know, whichever‚Ä¶

And the most important rule - no open source, only pr
oprietary, only hardcore!

P.S. Under every Reddit post, there‚Äôs always a comment saying, ‚ÄúClearly, this post was writte
n by ChatGPT.‚Äù Don‚Äôt bother. This post was entirely crafted by ChatGPT, no humans involved.

P.P.S. For those who made i
t through all these words - here‚Äôs a confession. I never do it that way. It's too long, costly, and complicated for me. 
I prefer the easy way. In fact, right now some friends of mine have invited me to test their RAG API. I load data in the
re and get a ready Search API - query as input, ready-made RAG context as output. That's what I realy like. I'm trying i
t for free now, and I look forward to the community edition in the future. Everything works pretty quickly. I'm testing 
the quality of the search now. If the quality is OK, I can tell about it here.

Hi all, I'm working on a side project that helps with sports analysis for historical games, which in turn will help with
 sports betting. Currently I've been only focused on MLB because I wanted to see how the use case would pan out.

My fir
st attempt at this was to use the openai endpoint and load all the relevant JSON objects and send a prompt along with th
em to GPT and see what I get back. Eventually, the context size was getting way too big and the problem I was running in
to was that it was expensive. Although, the prompts back were actually pretty decent and relevant to the data.

My secon
d attempt was to setup a RAG using Chroma/LangChain/GPT4o. I got it to work but the answers all seem very off and super 
vague. None of the data I have was shown in any of the prompts i asked, or any of the players that were playing in a gam
e were mentioned at all in the prompt back, plus it kept mentioning wrong games/teams whe asking it specific games. I‚Äôm 
assuming I might need to adjust the vector store a bit but not sure how I can do that with chroma.

My question is what 
might be the best way to setup some sort of process? My end result, I would like a response back using the historical da
ta I've provided to make assumptions on what a game could be like based off all the stats given, with some room for GPT 
to also make some inference as well.

deeplearning -  [ Creating a project on NLP ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1ey2e85/creating_a_project_on_nlp/) , 2024-08-26-0911
```
So me and my friend completed the ML and DL specialization by AndrewNg, and were just gonna get started on a project. We
 decided to make a academic assistant. So basically what this does is a user can upload a PDF,text file or any other sup
ported media and the can ask questions related to it's contents. The main objective being making learning quick given la
rger documents.

The pipeline we decided is pretty standard for such a project.

1. Split the text into chunks
2. Genera
te embeddings of the chunks
3. Store the chunks in a vector DB
4. Find the top K similar chunks to the query 
5. Retriev
e context and feed it into a LLM for an answer.

So I looked up for a library and framework to use and decided on langch
ain. We haven't decided on an LLM yet but want to run it locally so no OpenAI please. 

Since this is gonna be out first
 AI project confidence is low. I would really appreciate any heads up on the issues we may face, any suggestions on libr
aries,frameworks or models will be really helpful as well. 

Appreciate any resourceful comment üòä

deeplearning -  [ How To Build Your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Using Open-source Tools: LangChain, LLAMA 3,  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1emdotx/how_to_build_your_retrieval_augmented_generation/) , 2024-08-26-0911

TL;DR: RAG overcomes the limitations of LLMs by bringing in external sources of information as relevant context.  
  

At the end of the step-by-step tutorial, you will be able to give your favorite LLM (ChatGPT, LLAMA 3, Mixtral, Gemini, 
Claude, etc.) some documents, ask it a question and see it respond based on relevant context.  
  
This will be running 
locally, using open-source libraries. Zero API and tooling costs.

deeplearning -  [ Need help with creating CLI for 'non-programmers' (LLMs) ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1elrfgm/need_help_with_creating_cli_for_nonprogrammers/) , 2024-08-26-0911
```
***TL;DR*** What is the best way to convert user input into sequence of commands and their corresponding parameters? Lik
e, imagine you are not a programmer and there is a console app with a CLI, but, well, you don't know the structure and t
he syntax of commands. And you don't want to know. YBut! You have a locally running instance of llama3.1 -- or whatever 
open LLM is out there now -- and you can ask it to create a CLI command for you. What would you do to accomplish that?


**Intro**

A little bit of context. I'm working on a project that targets scientists as end users. It has some UI using 
which it's possible to do all sort of things the lab workers would like to do. But recently the projects product owner d
ecided that it would be cool to have a small chat window that is accessable basically everywhere throughout the applicat
ion UI in which 'lives' a bot that can accept some input from a user and do what is requested. The pool of commands is f
inite and predefined.

**The issue**

So, putting details aside, the main issue to be solved is parsing user input (unst
ructured and possible incomplete data) to some structured form. In general, each and every user input should be transfor
med into a data structure that represents a sequence of commands with their parameters, for example:

User input: Please
, create X with param1 set to value1 and param2 equal to value2

Desired output:

    create_x --param1 value1 --param2 
value2

In this example, there is only one command, but in real life the request can represent a sequence of N commands,
 and they may depend on each other (sequence of execution does matter)

**What I've tried so far**

I have an 'experimen
t' environment: a python project with `ollama` and `langchain` installed. The main model I test is llama3.1-instruct wit
h 5bit quantization. (I'm sort of limited with hardware resourses, so XXB parameter models do not fit).

Up until now, I
've tried to achieve what I want with prompting in different forms, but in general I do the following:

1. As the very f
irst message in the chat, I create a 'system' one which explain what commands are there. The format is the following (I 
replaced original data not to expose the context more, so it's very generic): 

```xml
<scope>
    <models>
        <mod
el name='entityA'>
            <field name='uniqueId' type='string' description='unique identifier for entityA'/>
      
      <field name='label' type='string' description='label for entityA'/>
            <field name='category' type='enum'
 possible-value='alpha, beta, gamma, delta'/>
        </model>
        <model name='entityB'>
            <field name='u
niqueId' description='unique identifier for entityB'/>
            <field name='entityAIds' type='array' description='id
entifiers of entityAs associated with this entityB'/>
        </model>
    </models>
    <commands>
        <command nam
e='create_entityA' description='creates an instance of entityA'>
            <param name='uniqueId' type='string' descri
ption='unique identifier for entityA'/>
            <param name='label' type='string' description='label for entityA' re
quired='true'/>
            <param name='category' type='enum' possible-values='alpha, beta, gamma, delta'
             
      description='category of entityA (one value from the possible values list)' required='true'/>
        </command>
 
       <command name='remove_entityA' description='removes an instance of entityA by its unique identifier'>
           
 <param name='uniqueId' description='unique identifier of the entityA to be removed'
                   required='true'/
>
        </command>
        <command name='create_entityB'>
            <param name='label' description='label for enti
tyB'/>
        </command>
        <command name='link_entityAs_to_entityB'
                 description='associates inst
ances of entityA with a specific entityB based on the provided unique identifier of entityB'>
            <param name='u
niqueId' description='unique identifier of the entityB to which entityAs should be associated'
                   requir
ed='true'/>
            <param name='entityAIds'
                   description='an array of unique identifiers of entit
yAs to associate with the entityB'
                   type='array'
                   required='true'/>
        </comman
d>
        <command name='navigate' description='indicates that a user wants to go to a specific section of the platform
'>
            <param name='section' possible-values='entitiesA, entitiesB, configuration' required='true'/>
        </c
ommand>
        <command name='support' description='should be executed when a user seeks assistance on available functi
ons'/>
    </commands>
</scope>
```

So, now the model is provided with some context. Then, also in the 'system' message
 I:

* 'tell' the model that user input should be converted into a sequence of commands along with the corresponding par
ameters, all of this is described in the XML above
* describe the desired output format
* try to enforce some restrictio
n and cover edge cases

**The question part**

*Is this approach* ***viable***\*?\*

If yes, maybe there are some ***way
s to improve it***?

If not, *what would be* ***the alternative***?

So far I don't see how to apply fine tuning here

T
hank you in advance!
