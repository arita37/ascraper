* Google Deepmind's AlphaChip AI has created three generations of TPUs, which are now wid
ely used in data centers globally.
* Initially unveiled in 2021, AlphaChip was the first AI method to design chip 'floor
plans,' significantly reducing design time from months to hours.
* The AI model continues to improve with each TPU gener
ation, achieving better chip layouts and proving more efficient than human designers for various hardware platforms.

# 🤣 TSMC execs dismiss OpenAI C
EO Sam Altman as a ‘podcasting bro’

* OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was reportedly dismissed as a 'podcasting bro' by senior TS
MC executives during his tour in the Far East last winter.
* Altman proposed a massive $7 trillion investment plan for A
I advancements, including 36 new semiconductor plants, which TSMC execs found impractical and overly ambitious.
* The di
smissive attitude towards Altman's proposals reflects broader skepticism, with OpenAI's current business model showing s
ignificant financial discrepancy between its income and expenditure.

Google
 just upgraded its NotebookLM tool, adding support for YouTube videos and audio files, along with easier sharing of Audi
o Overviews—its latest viral AI hit that turns notes, PDFs, Google Docs, and more into AI-generated podcasts.

* Noteboo
kLM now supports public YouTube URLs and audio files, allowing users to analyze videos, lectures, and audio alongside ex
isting text sources.
* The tool leverages Gemini 1.5’s multimodal capabilities to summarize key concepts from videos and
 transcribe audio.
* A new sharing feature allows users to generate public links for Audio Overviews, making collaborati
on even easier.
* These updates aim to streamline tasks such as creating study guides, analyzing multiple perspectives o
n issues, and extracting important information from video, audio, and text.

It’s a big day for Google. The company’s vi
ral hit with NotebookLM is now even more impressive with access to YouTube videos and audio files. YouTube is an endless
 treasure chest of how-to guides, lectures, documentaries, and entertainment—and now, anyone can consume hours worth of 
videos in minutes with AI.

Archaeologists from Japa
n’s Yamagata University, in collaboration with IBM Research, used AI to uncover 303 previously unknown geoglyphs near Pe
ru’s famous Nazca Lines, nearly doubling the number of known figures at the site.

* The newly discovered geoglyphs, dat
ing back to 200 BC, depict various animals and humans, including parrots, cats, monkeys, killer whales, and even decapit
ated heads.
* AI combined with low-flying drones dramatically accelerated the discovery process, accomplishing nearly a 
century’s worth of work in six months.
* These smaller geoglyphs (10-25 feet across) provide new insights into the trans
ition from the Paracas culture to the Nazca culture.
* The findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academ
y of Sciences, demonstrate AI’s ability to help greatly improve archaeological research.

 Is there anything AI can’t he
lp us accomplish? The amount of time saved using low-flying drones and artificial intelligence is worth repeating: 100 y
ears worth of work in *six months*. The ways in which AI is going to impact our lives are still vast and largely unknown
, as this discovery proves.

```
I have a large codebase for which I'm supposed to make vector embeddings 
 
I'm loading all the programming files in my 
loader and doing RecursiveTextSpillter for chunk_size=5000

I'm using Qdrant with OpenAI embeddings with chunk_size=5000
 in embedding function as well. Qdrant is able to make vector db much faster without any issues, only problem I have wit
h Qdrant is we can't connect to same db with two or more instances, so I can't use it for production purpose, have to us
e docker and all, which I don't have to use for now

So I was looking for alternatives

But when I'm using ChromaDB, Lan
ceDB, FAISS with exactly this chunk_size they give an error something RateLimitError for my Embedding function and try a
gain after 8000+ seconds etc, which is definitely not the case since I'm able to make embeddings with Qdrant even after 
getting this error on other DBs


Long time back I created embeddings with ChromaDB with chunk_size=1000 it created and 
took more than 2x time than Qdrant takes, but even with chunk_size=1000 ChromaDB isn't working, it ran for 3 hours and g

Hey folks!

So, I am currently developing a project that is essentially a chatbot running with Langgraph to create agent
 routing.

My architecture is basically a router node that has just a conditional edge that acts as the chatbot itself, 
whom has access to a tool that should be able to access a Mongo collection and basically transform an user request (e.g.
: Hi, I would like to know what tennis rackets you have.) into a (generalized) Mongo query, aiming for a keyword (in thi
s case, tennis racket).

Has anyone ever worked with something similar and has a guideline on this?

I am quite new to M
ongo, hence my maybe trivial doubt.

Any suggestions are highly appreciated! :)

```
u/hwchase17 I've run into an interesting issue while testing RedisSemanticCache, and I'm hoping someone can shed some li
ght on whether this is expected behavior or potentially a bug.

**Setup:**

* Using redis-stack-server image for testing

* Implementing RedisSemanticCache with AzureChatOpenAI models
* Script designed to test caching with multiple queries a
nd model switches

**Observed Behavior:**

1. Cache entries in Redis remain unchanged across different queries
2. The sa
me response content is repeated for all queries, regardless of the input
3. Switching models adds a new key, but the beh
avior persists

**Pip List:**

    langchain_openai==0.2.1
    langchain-community==0.3.1
    langchain==0.3.1
    langc
hain-core==0.3.6

**Code Snippet:**

    r_s = RedisSemanticCache( 
        embedding=openai_embeddings, 
        score_
threshold=0.9, 
        redis_url='redis://localhost:6379' 
    ) 
    
    set_llm_cache(r_s) 
    
    # Test queries 

    test_queries = [ 
        'What is 1+1?', 
        'Tell me one joke', 
        'What is 21+1?', 
        'What is 
1+1?' # Repeated query to test caching 
    ] 
    
    for query in test_queries: 
        result = model_1.invoke(quer
y, config=runnable_conf) 
        print(f'Result: {result}') 
        print_cache_contents()

**Output Highlights:**

* 
All queries return the same result: '1 + 1 equals 2.'
* Cache contents show only one entry that doesn't change: `Key: do
c:cache:35f543b7708b88fdb2b67609e4aabb2a:b5ec2bce858044cdba443ea20847a3b0, Type: hash, Value: <hash type>`
* Switching t
o model\_2 adds a new key but exhibits the same behavior

**Questions:**

1. Is this the expected behavior for RedisSema
nticCache?
2. Should the cache not update with new entries for different queries?
3. Are there any configuration setting
s I might be missing?

I'd greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions on how to properly implement and utilize Redis
SemanticCache. Thanks in advance for your help!

* When developing an LLM Application, the Prompt + LLM + Output parser of Langchain is sufficient for.
* Promp
t is similar to a feature specification and has enough information about the module.
* Agent can be built by connecting

# Target Audience 

For anyone building
 an LLM Application. This framework is intended for production, but is currently in alpha version and suitable for proto
typing.

# Comparison 

* LangChain : 🦜🔗 Build context-aware reasoning applications
* LlamaIndex is a data framework for
 your LLM applications
* LiteLLM : Python SDK, Proxy Server (LLM Gateway) to call 100+ LLM APIs in OpenAI format - \[Bed
rock, Azure, OpenAI, VertexAI, Cohere, Anthropic, Sagemaker, HuggingFace, Replicate, Groq\]
* DSPy : The framework for p
rogramming—not prompting—foundation models

LangDict aims to be simple. All you need to use is a Python Dictionary. It's
 just a matter of writing the LLM's functional specification in a Dictionary, and being able to handle the module's inpu
ts and outputs in a Dictionary as well.

I am looking through all the langchain information but am in need of generating SQL queries for an excel file/CSV or eve
n a converted sqlite db.  The information inside is schema information. (e.g. table names, schemas, meta descriptions) i
t is strung over multiple tabs so a DB would be several tables or can be joined to become 1 single DF -> csv.

I have wo
rked through building SQL output for actual DB but not a repository of meta schema(s) information assembled in an excel.
  

Ideally would like the SQL output to handle understanding relationships and joins(could do with semantic search exam
ple).

Hey fellows.  
  
I’ve been thinking about this idea for a while now and wanted to see what you all think. What if we bu
ilt a “**true news**” reading tool, powered by LLM Agents?  
  
We’re all constantly flooded with news, but it feels lik
e every media outlet has its own agenda. It’s getting harder to figure out what’s actually “true.” You can read about th
e same event from American, European, Chinese, Russian, or other sources, and it’ll be framed completely differently. So
, what’s the real story? Are we unknowingly influenced by propaganda that skews our view of reality?  
  
Here’s my idea
:   
What if we used LLM Agents to tackle this? When you’re reading a trending news story, the agent automatically finds
 related reports from multiple sources, including those with different perspectives and neutral third-party outlets. The
n, the agent compares and analyzes these reports to highlight the key differences and common ground. Could this help us 
get a more balanced view of world events?   
  
What do you think—does this seem feasible?

From my understanding, dynamically creating a d

```
Hi everyone!

I was tasked with building a front-end migration tool for one of our clients. They’ve already migrated som
e React code from Angular, which could be useful as part of a few-shot approach. 
We’re considering two possible directi
ons to assist the devs on this migration:

1. Coding assistant tool: A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that
 understands the codebase and, based on user interactions, suggests code snippets or modifications.


2. Fully automated
 agent: A system that automatically generates React code after analyzing the existing Angular codebase.



With so many 
tools out there, I’m curious if anyone has worked on a similar project and could recommend some approaches. Here's a lis
t of tools I’ve come across and how they fit into our potential strategies:

Cursor: We’re thinking of recommending the 
business version of Cursor to our client. It has a 'compose' feature that seems promising for migration.

Langchain: It 
has some useful tutorials on code comprehension, but it’s not great for quick code generation across multiple folders. S
till, it could be valuable for the chatbot approach (direction 1).

GPT-Engineer: Opposite of LangChain: it is more suit
ed for generating a full code project based on a prompt, but it lacks comprehensive code comprehension features, which l
imits its usefulness for code migration.


Has anyone here dealt with a similar need? I’d love to hear any suggestions o
r ideas on other tools that might be helpful.

Thanks in advance!

```
As we implement a chatting agent with langgraph and Firestore database, we're trying to implement a Firestore checkpoint
er to record historical data in the Firestore db. We've just realized that each checkpoint data contains the entire chat
 message history in checkpoint>channel\_values>messages.

This means if I have 5 chat messages in the chat history, each
 checkpoint>channel\_values>messages would look like this:

\[msg1, msg2, msg3, msg4, msg5\]

\[msg1, msg2, msg3, msg4\]


\[msg1, msg2, msg3\]

\[msg1, msg2\]

\[msg1\]



Is this a scalable approach? As more messages accumulate, the last c
heckpoint data size would become huge. Yes, it'd be convenient to have all historical data, but we'd definitely need to 
summarize, trim, or filter messages when calling the LLM.



Am I missing something? I'm trying to understand the intent

```
Hello everyone,

I'm developing an order system for a fake hardware store called MetalTech using TypeScript, Node.js, an
d LangGraph. I'm looking to enhance our virtual assistant with a smart product search capability before adding items to 
an order.

What I'm aiming to achieve:

1. Integrate a real database (open to suggestions).

2. Implement an intelligent
 product search function that:

   - Handles exact matches

   - Deals with misspellings

   - Recognizes synonyms or al
ternative product names

   - Matches with multiple variants of a product



For instance, I want the system to:

- Reco
gnize 'screws' might refer to 'Stainless Steel Screw' in the database

- Understand 'hammr' is likely a misspelling of '
hammer'

- Know that 'cutting disc' could be the same as 'abrasive wheel'

- Match 'drill' with various types like 'cord
less drill', 'hammer drill', 'drill press', etc.



My main challenges are:

1. Structuring this smart search efficientl
y within the LangGraph architecture

2. Implementing fuzzy matching for misspellings

3. Creating a system for synonyms 
and alternative product names

4. Designing a way to return and handle multiple product variants



Key questions:

- Ho
w can I implement this multi-faceted search effectively?

- How should I handle cases where a general term (like 'drill'
) matches multiple specific products?



Has anyone implemented a similar smart, multi-variant search system, especially
 within a LangGraph-based application? Any suggestions on approaches, libraries, or best practices would be greatly appr
eciated.



Thank you in advance for your insights!

```
I'm working on a simple POC for one of my clients where they want their users to stop using ChatGPT (for obvious governa
nce, data privacy reasons). They want us to come up with a simple alternative to ChatGPT with a model endpoint in Azure 
OpenAI. The main feature that the people use is 'upload and talk to the file' feature from ChatGPT. They upload PDFs, Ex
cels and get help from the language models to summarize, visualize, report better.

The app has a very simple flow -

1.
 Allow users to upload files for a chat session
2. Use AI to answer questions about these uploaded files
3. Dispose of a
ll data when the session ends or times out

The main architectural challenge is handling the lifecycle of the data:

* E
fficiently processing and storing uploaded files
* Ensuring complete data cleanup after the session

A few questions - 


1. What's the best way to architect this kind of session-based file processing and AI chat application?
2. How can we h
andle file storage and embedding creation in a way that's both efficient during the session and easy to clean up after?

3. Are there specific services or technologies that are well-suited for this kind of temporary, session-based data handl
ing?

I'm particularly interested in hearing about real-world solutions and any lessons learned from implementing simila
r systems. Any advice, best practices, or even cautionary tales would be greatly appreciated!

eated a pre-processing approach that works for my sample pdfs pretty well. But here users can upload any pdfs and chat. 
  
  
I understand pre-processing is an important step but with pdfs that doesn't have common format of text arrangement
, how one can implement that. I think its not possible to take a unified approach for pre-processing for all types of pd
fs. But have seen lots of chat with your pdfs application online nowadays. Are they really good? if so what approach the
y might have taken? What everyone thinks? Correct me if I am wrong. Would like to hear more views.

Hey everyone, we’re excited to announce the release of **AutoRAG v0.3.0**, packed with some great improvements!

[https:
//github.com/Marker-Inc-Korea/AutoRAG](https://github.com/Marker-Inc-Korea/AutoRAG)

# What is AutoRAG?

[AutoRAG suppor
ts evaluation data creation and auto optimization of RAG + deploy](https://preview.redd.it/8oisml8wi3rd1.png?width=2784&

AutoRAG is an **AutoML tool** designed to help you aut
omatically find the optimal **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** for **your data**. There are tons of RAG p
ipelines and modules out there, but finding the best one for your specific use case can be tough and time-consuming. Wit
hout evaluating different modules, you might never know which setup works best for your needs.

AutoRAG solves this by a
llowing you to evaluate multiple RAG modules with your own data and automatically pinpoint the best pipeline for your us
e case.

[How AutoRAG optimizes complex RAG pipelines](https://i.redd.it/knhg6ls2j3rd1.gif)

# What’s new in v0.3.0?

1.
 **Faster response time for deployments**
2. **Improved data creation pipeline** with customizable parsing and chunking 
tools using YAML.
3. Now supports  LangChain 0.3, LlamaIndex 0.11, and OpenAI o1 models.

all -  [ Help with Relationship Extraction using SchemaLLMPathExtractor and Ollama ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1fpofgu/help_with_relationship_extraction_using/) , 2024-09-28-0912
```
Hi Everyone,  
I'm working on relationship extraction using the `PropertyGraphStore` class from Langchain, following the
 approach outlined in [this guide](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/property_graph/property_graph_advanced/
). I'm trying to restrict the nodes and relationships being extracted by using `SchemaLLMPathExtractor`.

However, I'm f
acing an issue when using local models like Llama 3.1 and Mistral through Ollama: nothing gets extracted. Interestingly,
 if I remove `SchemaLLMPathExtractor`, it extracts a lot of relationships. Additionally, when I use OpenAI instead of Ol
lama, it works fine even with `SchemaLLMPathExtractor`.

Has anyone else experienced this issue or know how to make Olla
ma work properly with `SchemaLLMPathExtractor`? It seems to be working for others in blogs and videos, but I can’t figur
e out what I’m doing wrong. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Hello community,
I wish to know if someone has had experience with agentic workflows that use function and tools using l
lama3.1 models? The model is hosted on vLLM.

I was not able to see much resources in this area most of them pointed tow
ards closed source models that use langgraph or langchain.

I did find llama-stack from meta but it was difficult for me
 to wrap my head around it. If anyone can help, my learning can get easier.

Thank you.

MachineLearning -  [ Built a web agent which call fill Google forms based on the user details [P] ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fozud5/built_a_web_agent_which_call_fill_google_forms/) , 2024-09-28-0912
```
GitHub repo : [https://github.com/shaRk-033/web-agent](https://github.com/shaRk-033/web-agent)

Tried to solve it using 
two approaches:

# 1: Basic Scraping and Filling

This is the straightforward approach. The agent scrapes the form’s HTM
L and uses fixed XPaths to find and fill in the required fields.

* It pulls the form’s HTML, locates the fields with se
t XPaths, and inputs the answers. It’s a direct and simple method.
* If the form changes or an element isn’t where it’s 
expected, the process can fail and may need manual adjustments.

[basic approach](https://preview.redd.it/5e8g4a1k4xqd1.
png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8e984e4feaee2f0453b08c8696768c40a2a5c20)

2. Using LangChain Agents and tool call
ing

* LangChain Agent**:** The agent handles everything by using the LLM’s reasoning to decide what to do next, includi
ng generating those tricky XPaths.
* Error Handling**:** If something goes wrong (like an element not found), the agent 
tries again with better XPaths until it gets the job done.

d1.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed1e6c19efec9f4cbbbd6ab5a22558f221cf745f)

Any recommendations to improve this w
ould be welcome. Also, if anyone has ideas on building similar web agents to automate other tasks, it would be great to 
hear them. :)

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Swapping Embedding Models for an LLM ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fktvbj/p_swapping_embedding_models_for_an_llm/) , 2024-09-28-0912
```
How tightly coupled is an embedding model to a language model?

Taking an example from Langchain's tutorials, they use O
llama's _nomic-embed-text_ for embedding and _Llama3.1_ for the understanding and Q/A. I don't see any documentation abo
ut Llama being built on embeddings from this embedding model. 

Intuition suggests that a different embedding model may 
produce outputs of other sizes or produce a different tensor for a character/word, which would have an impact on the res
ults of the LLM. So would changing an embedding model require retraining/fine-tuning the LLM as well?

I need to use a e
mbedding model for code snippets and text. Do I need to find a specialized embedding model for that? If yes, how will ll
ama3.1 ingest the embeddings?

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Review and suggest ideas for my chatbot ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fb2mwl/p_review_and_suggest_ideas_for_my_chatbot/) , 2024-09-28-0912
```
Ok, so I am currently trying to build support chatbot with following technicalities 
1. FastAPI for web server(Need to m
ake it faster)
2. Qdrant as Vector Data Base(Found it to be the fastest amongst Chromadb, Elastic Search and Milvus)
3. 
MongoDB for storing all the data and feedback.
4. Semantic chunking with max token limit of 512.
5. granite-13b-chat-v2 
as the LLM(I know it's not good but I have limited options available)
6. The data is structured as well as unstructured.
 Thinking of having involving GraphRAG with current architecture.
7. Multiple data sources stored in multiple collection
s of vector database because I have implemented an access control.
8. Using mongoengine currently as a ORM. If you know 
something better please suggest.
9. Using all-miniLM-l6-v2 as vector embedding currently but planning to use stella_en_4
00M_v5.
10. Using cosine similarity to retrieve the documents.
11. Using BLEU, F1 and BERT score for automated evaluatio
n based on golden answer.
12. Using top_k as 3.
13. Currently using basic question answering prompt but want to improve 
it. Any tips? Also heard about Automatic Prompt Evaluation.
14. Currently using custom code for everything. Looking to u
se Llamaindex or Langchain for this. 
15. Right now I am not using any AI Agent, but I want to know your opinions. 
16. 
It's a simple RAG framework and I am working on improving it.
17. I haven't included reranker but I am planning to do so
 too.

I think I mentioned pretty much everything I am using for my project. So please share your suggestions, comments 
and reviews for the same. Thank you!!

deeplearning -  [ What is the best approach for Parsing and Retrieving Code Context Across Multiple Files in a Hierarc ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1fh58oz/what_is_the_best_approach_for_parsing_and/) , 2024-09-28-0912
```
I want to implement a Code-RAG system on a code directory where I need to:

* Parse and load all the files from folders 
and subfolders while excluding specific file extensions.
* Embed and store the parsed content into a vector store.
* Ret
rieve relevant information based on user queries.

However, I’m facing two major challenges:

**File Parsing and Loading
:** What’s the most efficient method to parse and load files in a hierarchical manner (reflecting their folder structure
)? Should I use Langchain’s directory loader, or is there a better way? I came across the Tree-sitter tool in Claude-dev
’s repo, which is used to build syntax trees for source files—would this be useful for hierarchical parsing?

**Cross-Fi
le Context Retrieval:** If the relevant context for a user’s query is spread across multiple files located in different 
subfolders, how can I fine-tune my retrieval system to identify the correct context across these files? Would reranking 
resolve this, or is there a better approach?

**Query Translation:** Do I need to use Something like Multi-Query or RAG-
Fusion to achieve better retrieval for hierarchical data?

\[I want to understand how tools like [continue.dev](http://c
ontinue.dev/) and [claude-dev](https://github.com/saoudrizwan/claude-dev) work\]

Are Agents just simple rules? Are Agents just enhanced reasoning? The answer is yes and no. Yes, in the sens
e that agents have simple rules and can sometimes enhance reasoning capabilities compared to a single prompt. But No in 
the sense that agents can have a much more diverse functionality like using specific tools, summarizing, or even followi
ng a particular style. In this blog, we look into how to set up these agents in a hierarchal manner just like running a 
small team of Authors, researchers, and supervisors.

[**How To Build Hierarchical Multi-Agent Systems?**](https://mediu

**TextGrad
**. It is a powerful framework performing automatic “differentiation” via text. **It backpropagates textual feedback pro
vided by LLMs to improve individual components of a compound AI system.** In this framework, LLMs provide rich, general,
 natural language suggestions to optimize variables in computation graphs, ranging from code snippets to molecular struc
tures. TextGrad showed effectiveness and generality across various applications, from question-answering and molecule op
timization to radiotherapy treatment planning.

The addition of RAG t
o LLMs was an excellent idea. It helped the LLMs to become more specific and individualized. Adding new components to an
y system leads to more interactions and its own sets of problems. Adding RAG to LLMs leads to several problems such as h
ow to retrieve the best content, what type of prompt to write, and many more.

In this blog, we are going to combine the
 **LangChain RAG with DSPy**. We deep dive into how to evaluate the RAG pipeline quantitatively using **RAGAs** and how 
to create a system where instead of manually tweaking prompts, we let the system figure out the best prompt.

As the field of natural language processing (NLP) advances, the evaluation of large language
 models (LLMs) like GPT-4 becomes increasingly important and complex. Traditional metrics such as accuracy are often ina
dequate for assessing these models’ performance because they fail to capture the nuances of human language. In this arti
cle, we will explore why evaluating LLMs is challenging and discuss effective methods like BLEU and ROUGE for a more com
prehensive evaluation.

# AI Monthly News

# AI Act enters into force

On 1 August 2024, th
e European Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) enters into force. The Act aims to foster responsible artificial intelli
gence development and deployment in the EU. The AI Act introduces a uniform framework across all EU countries, based on 
a forward-looking definition of AI and a risk-based approach:

* **Minimal risk:** most AI systems such as spam filters 
and AI-enabled video games face no obligation under the AI Act, but companies can voluntarily adopt additional codes of 
conduct.
* **Specific transparency risk:** systems like chatbots must clearly inform users that they are interacting wit
h a machine, while certain AI-generated content must be labelled as such.
* **High risk:** high-risk AI systems such as 
AI-based medical software or AI systems used for recruitment must comply with strict requirements, including risk-mitiga
tion systems, high-quality of data sets, clear user information, human oversight, etc.
* **Unacceptable risk:** for exam
ple, AI systems that allow “social scoring” by governments or companies are considered a clear threat to people’s fundam
ental rights and are therefore banned.

# California AI bill SB-1047 sparks fierce debate, Senator likens it to ‘Jets vs. Sharks’ feud


**Key Aspects of SB-1047:**

* Regulation Scope: Targets “frontier” AI models, defined by their immense computational t
raining requirements (over 10²⁶ operations) or significant financial investment (>$100 million).
* Compliance Requiremen
ts: Developers must implement safety protocols, including the ability to immediately shut down, cybersecurity measures, 
and risk assessments, before model deployment.
* Whistleblower Protections: Encourages reporting of non-compliance or ri
sks by offering protection against retaliation.
* Safety Incident Reporting: Mandates reporting AI safety incidents with
in 72 hours to a newly established Frontier Model Division.
* Certification: Developers need to certify compliance, pote
ntially under penalty of perjury in earlier drafts, though amendments might have altered this.

**Pros:**

* Safety Firs
t: Prioritizes the prevention of catastrophic harms by enforcing rigorous safety standards, potentially safeguarding aga
inst AI misuse or malfunction.
* Incentivizes Responsible Development: By setting high standards for AI model training, 
the company encourages developers to think critically about the implications of their creations.
* Public Trust: Enhance
s public confidence in AI by ensuring transparency and accountability in the development process.

**Cons:**

* Innovati
on Stagnation: Critics argue it might stifle innovation, especially in open-source AI, due to the high costs and regulat
ory burdens of compliance.
* Ambiguity: Some definitions and requirements might be too specific or broad, leading to leg
al challenges or unintended consequences.
* Global Competitiveness: There’s concern that such regulations could push AI 
development outside California or the U.S., benefiting other nations without similar restrictions.
* Implementation Chal
lenges: The practicalities of enforcing such regulations, especially the “positive safety determination,” could be compl
ex and contentious.

# MORE OpenAI drama

OpenAI co-founder John
 Schulman has left the company to join rival AI startup Anthropic, while OpenAI president and co-founder Greg Brockman i
s taking an extended leave until the end of the year. Schulman, who played a key role in creating the AI-powered chatbot
 platform ChatGPT and led OpenAI’s alignment science efforts, stated his move was driven by a desire to focus more on AI
 alignment and hands-on technical work. Peter Deng, a product manager who joined OpenAI last year, has also left the com
pany. With these departures, only three of OpenAI’s original 11 founders remain: CEO Sam Altman, Brockman, and Wojciech 
Zaremba, lead of language and code generation.
