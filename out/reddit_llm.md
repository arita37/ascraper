```
I recently started getting in LLM-powered applications by myself and using online resources. What I discovered is that L
LMs have become so mainstream that there are so many platform, frameworks, and model to choose from. And usually I don't
 even understand what are the key differences between one another

This is what I understood, please enlighten me and wh
oever comes here through a Google search

- LLMs are huge models and if I want to run them locally I should use a quanti
zed version: what are the best practices? What are the requirements? I'm currently using windows but I'm having so much 
troubles 

- Faster inference: what are the differences between vLLM, llamacpp, and ollama? The second one is the only o
ne that *should* work on windows. Should I always use these frameworks? Are they used only to load the quantized model? 


- Deployment. What are the best platform / best practices regarding the deployment phase? I guess a logic choice would
 be having the LLM available via API

- Fine-tuning. There are multiple ways to fine-tune a LLM. LORA seems a good trade
-off. Should I use a particular framework to apply it? Moreover, let's say I fine-tune my model over different use-cases
. In production, how do I swap the weights for these different models efficiently? 

- Orchestrator. LangChain should be
 the most popular one, but is it the one to go for? I see they are working on a huge refactor

```
Hello Everyone,

I am currently developing an information retrieval application designed to work with HTML pages, rangin
g in length from 30 to 200 pages. The application utilizes LangChain, OpenAI, and FAISS for its core functionalities. A 
significant part of the process involves chunking HTML pages, many of which contain numerous tables. My method involves 
extracting tables from the HTML pages, identifying them by their top titles for indexing and retrieval purposes.

Howeve
r, I have encountered two main issues during retrieval:

* Long Query Handling: When the query is slightly longer, the r
etrieval system does not return the correct answer. It seems to struggle with maintaining accuracy as the query length i
ncreases.
* Variance in Wording: The system fails to correctly retrieve chunks when there is a discrepancy between the w
ording in the query and the chunks. For example, if the query uses 'six' but the chunk contains '6', the system does not
 recognize them as a match.

These challenges are hindering the application's ability to accurately retrieve information
, especially when dealing with nuanced or detailed queries.

I am reaching out to this community for advice or strategie
s on how to address these issues. Specifically, I am interested in approaches that could improve the handling of long qu
eries and the recognition of synonymous terms or different word forms (like numerals versus written numbers) during the 
retrieval process.

Any suggestions or insights on how to refine the retrieval accuracy of this application would be gre
atly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your help!

Hey everyone,

I've been working on a project where I extract information from a large PDF document. I've completed the 
initial steps, including reading the PDF, splitting it into chunks, converting them to embeddings, and storing them in a
 vector database.

For the next step, I perform a similarity check with a limit of 28. Each chunk has a size of 350, wit
h an overlap of 80. After that, I send these chunks to GPT with a specific question. GPT provides answers, but I'm strug
gling to determine from which chunk the answer originated.

Is there a way to identify the specific chunk(s) that GPT us
ed to generate the answer? Alternatively, is there a solution to get an array of chunks that may contain the answer out 
of the 28 available?

Any insights or suggestions on how to achieve this would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advanc

 Hey everyone!

I'm having a bit of trouble and could really use your wisdom. My company is eager to add AI to their pro
ducts and daily operations.

We have this internal initiative where people from various departments come together to inn
ovate or improve something, to add more value to the organization. My group has the task to develop an AI Chatbot, to as
sume some of the functions typically performed by an analyst, in a specific type of service, where it interacts with the
 customer, collects information for a specific process and uses this information to parameterize the company's system, f
or that specific customer.

Here's the problem: we have about 160 person-hours per month, split between three of us, ove
r the next three months, to go from having zero expertise in creating AI-powered apps to delivering a functional AI-powe
red chatbot MVP.

It is clear that they do not know what they are doing about this matter. They gave us ChatGPT licenses
 after we requested OpenAI API credits. So they asked us to create a detailed AI spending plan, so they can evaluate (an
d yes, we are a technology company with over 1k employees).

Now they want us to move our development efforts to Copilot
 Studio, abandoning our current development with Python and Langchain. From what I gather, this may not be the wisest co
urse of action, especially considering the intricate context management our project requires (different rules for answer
s, complex questions) and the potential lock-in with the Microsoft ecosystem (also, for what I could check, the client n
eeds to pay for copilot studio as well). They don't even have paid Copilot Studio yet (don't know if they will ever do).


The challenge is that we don't really know much about AI development (we're trying to study it in the meantime), so it
's hard to argue with them.

Can anyone here help us understand if it's true that Copilot Studio could be a better solut
ion? Yes? No?

I would deeply appreciate any information or advice you could share so I can craft a well-informed respon
se.

Thank you very much in advance for your contribution and time!

 needs to pay for copilot studio as well). They don't even have paid Copilot Studio yet (don't know if they will ever do
).

The challenge is that we don't really know much about AI development (we're trying to study it in the meantime), so 
it's hard to argue with them.

Can anyone here help us understand if it's true that Copilot Studio could be a better sol
ution? Yes? No?

Hey everyone!  
  
I'm having a bit of trouble and could really use your wisdom. My company is eager to add AI to thei
r products and daily operations. 

We have this internal initiative where people from various departments come together 
to innovate or improve something, to add more value to the organization. My group has the task to develop an AI Chatbot
, to assume some of the functions typically performed by an analyst, in a specific type of service, where it interacts w
ith the customer, collects information for a specific process and uses this information to parameterize the company's sy
stem, for that specific customer.

Here's the problem: we have about 160 person-hours per month, split between three of 
us, over the next three months, to go from having zero expertise in creating AI-powered apps to delivering a functional 
AI-powered chatbot MVP.

It is clear that they do not know what they are doing about this matter. They gave us ChatGPT 
licenses after we requested OpenAI API credits. So they asked us to create a detailed AI spending plan, so they can eval
uate (and yes, we are a technology company with over 1k employees).  
  
Now they want us to move our development effo
rts to Copilot Studio, abandoning our current development with Python and Langchain. From what I gather, this may not be
 the wisest course of action, especially considering the intricate context management our project requires (different ru
les for answers, complex questions) and the potential lock-in with the Microsoft ecosystem (also, for what I could check
, the client needs to pay for copilot studio as well). They don't even have paid Copilot Studio yet (don't know if they 
will ever do). 

The challenge is that we don't really know much about AI development (we're trying to study it in the m
eantime), so it's hard to argue with them.

Can anyone here help us understand if it's true that Copilot Studio could b
e a better solution? Yes? No?  
I would deeply appreciate any information or advice you could share so I can craft a we
ll-informed response.

```
I have ~2700 pdf documents, which are transcripts of Danish political conversations. The data is not confidential.

I wa
nt to create an gpt-4-based chatbot (Using something like streamlit or chainlit) that can answer (In Danish) about the p
dfs.

So far I have tried using this [azure search open ai demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-de
mo) which garnered fairly good results, but is pretty expensive to set up and run.

Can the same performance be achieved
 (or better) using langchain?

And if so, are there repos or blog posts that I should take a look at given my use case? 
(Wanting a danish chatbot and using a fairly large amount of pdfs) 

Thank you!

```
I've tried things like langchain in the past (6-8 months ago) but they were cumbersome and didn't work as expected.

I  
need RAG to get data from various pdfs (long one, 150+ pages) - and i  need a setup that will allow me to add more and m
ore data sources.

I wanna run this locally, can get a 24gb video card (or 2x16gb ones) - so i can run using 33b or smal
ler models.

I  know things in the industry change every 2 weeks, so i'm hoping there's  an easy and efficient way of do
ing RAG (compared to 6 months ago)

Hey Reddit, I've been applying for jobs and found that writing a cover letter for each position was tedious. I also delv
ed into LLM and Langchain, hoping to leverage them for a project to aid in my job hunting. So, I developed Anukool under
 the GPL license. While it's far from perfect, it has proven very useful to me, and I hope it benefits you as well. All 
I have to do is provide it with a pdf containing information about me such as my experience, skills, projects, etc and i
t will use this information along with job description to generate cover letter for me. Since I'm new to ML and LLM, any
 advice or feedback is greatly appreciated, and contributions are also welcome. I plan to utilize Llama-2 soon to furthe
r open-source the project.

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Code vs JSON output for LLM agents? Frameworks like LangChain rely on LLMs responding with JSON  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/197f416/d_code_vs_json_output_for_llm_agents_frameworks/) , 2024-02-05-0910
```
[CaP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07753.pdf), [Voyager](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16291.pdf), [Octopus](https://arxiv.or
g/abs/2310.08588)

I work primarily with JSON based agents but code-as-policy agents seem to be extremely powerful. Here
 are some of the benefits and weaknesses I've seen

Pros of code

1. Less tool creation needed - The prebuilt math/file/
string/list manipulation abilities that come with code are enormous. In a JSON based agent, you would have to formally d
eclare each of these as a tool which you expose to the LLM and explain in your prompting, which is a lot of work and eat
s up a ton of the context window. 
2. Reduced number of transactions - The LLM can write scripts that invoke multiple to
ols and manipulate their results in ways that are difficult to do in a single transaction via JSON. For example, in one 
script, the model could search a DB 3 times, perform regex on the query results, convert them to integers, and add them 
up. Doing this in one step via JSON tool invocations is basically impossible. 
3. Less syntax errors - this might be tot
ally just vibe-based reasoning, but it really seems like LLMs have an easier time writing valid python than valid JSON, 
especially when you have lots of nested arguments in your methods.

Cons

1. Crazy risky - This is the obvious one. You 
have a machine executing random code. There are ways to mitigate this but still. I mean seriously we all learned not to 
use eval, so it is crazy to basically see research tending towards just running eval on the outputs of these models. 
2.
 Scripts with errors - Sometimes the model tries to get too fancy and writes complex programs that have bugs, resulting 
in many needed retries. 

Do any of you have thoughts or experience with these approaches in the wild? 

Is anybody awar
e of any experiments that compare these two approaches against each other?

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Are Custom LLM RAG apps going to become redundant? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1929n4f/d_are_custom_llm_rag_apps_going_to_become/) , 2024-02-05-0910
```
Loks like Copilot Studio is being rolled out (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio
) with an impressive looking no code/out of the box RAG solution.

There is a phenomenal amount of development and activ
ity in the Open Source RAG world (e.g Langchain, Llamaindex, etc), which I am a great supporter of FYI.

However, what s
eems strange is that this no code out of the box solution (Copilot Studio - just as an example of one) seems overwhelmin
gly to be the better option if you wanted to build a RAG app i.e If you compare the cost to build and productionise a cu
stom RAG app vs the cost of using Copilot Studio, it's almost an order of magnitude lower (no matter how you cut it with
 the developer time and duration). 

My question is, it seems to me we are moving towards a situation where enterprise s
olutions will make custom RAG apps redundant (not in all cases of course, but most cases), however there seems to be ver
y little discussion of this relative to the activity in the open source community. Do people agree this is a likely scen
ario? 

Obviously there will be exceptions‚Ä¶but on most use cases I don‚Äôt see how you can compete with an instant/minimal
 setup, low cost, highly scalable RAG solution.

deeplearning -  [ DSPy Explained! ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1adypks/dspy_explained/) , 2024-02-05-0910
```
DSPy is the next big advancement for AI and building applications with LLMs!

Pioneered by frameworks such as LangChain 
and LlamaIndex, we can build much more powerful systems by chaining together LLM calls! This means that the output of on
e call to an LLM is the input to the next, and so on. We can think of chains as programs, with each LLM call analogous t
o a function that takes text as input and produces text as output.

DSPy offers a new programming model, inspired by PyT
orch, that gives you a massive amount of control over these LLM programs. Further the Signature abstraction wraps prompt
s and structured input / outputs to clean up LLM program codebases.

DSPy then pairs the syntax with a super novel compi
ler that jointly optimizes the instructions for each component of an LLM program, as well as sourcing examples of the ta
sk.

Here is my review of the ideas in DSPy, covering the core concepts and walking through the introduction notebooks s
howing how to compile a simple retrieve-then-read RAG program, as well as a more advanced Multi-Hop RAG program where yo
u have 2 LLM components to be optimized with the DSPy compiler! I hope you find it useful!
