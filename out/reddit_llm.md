all -  [ How to Ensure Highly Relevant Search Results in Qdrant VectorStore with Metadata and Similarity Filt ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1gm4ebl/how_to_ensure_highly_relevant_search_results_in/) , 2024-11-08-0912
```
I'm working with Qdrant to build a search system for a diverse set of documents. My goal is to retrieve only the most re
levant results for a given query, avoiding unrelated documents even if they share similar keywords. For example, I have 
documents on legal cases and documents explaining construction processes, and I want to ensure that a query about a 'cli
ent process' in the context of a legal case doesn’t bring up results related to construction. I'm also usign langchain t
o get this results 

I’ve come across the `VectorStoreRetriever` options in Qdrant, which allow configuring search types
 like `'similarity'`, `'mmr'`, and `'similarity_score_threshold'`. I also see options for `score_threshold`, `k`, and `f
ilter` that can help refine results.

Here's how I’m currently thinking of setting it up:

* **Set** `search_type` **to*
* `'similarity_score_threshold'` to ensure only documents with a high relevance score are returned.
* **Use a** `score_t
hreshold` to filter out lower-relevance results.
* `vectorstore.as_retriever( search_type='mmr', search_kwargs={'k': 1, 
'lambda_mult': 0.25} )`

**My questions:**

1. Is this the best approach for narrowing down search results in Qdrant to 
ensure relevance and avoid unrelated content?
2. Any additional tips for optimizing Qdrant’s `VectorStoreRetriever` to h
andle large, diverse datasets?
3. Is this actually possible? I understand that my answer remains unchanged and coherent,
 but the incorrect metadata still appears. If I need to use this metadata as a reference, it could cause confusion.

Tha
nks in advance for any guidance or recommendations!

all -  [ Tutorial on building agent with memory using Letta  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1glzob6/tutorial_on_building_agent_with_memory_using_letta/) , 2024-11-08-0912
```
Hi all - I'm one of the creators of [Letta](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta), an agents framework focused on memory, a
nd we just released a free short [course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/llms-as-operating-systems-agent-memo
ry/) with Andrew Ng. The course covers both the memory management research (e.g. MemGPT) behind Letta, as well as an int
roduction to using the OSS agents framework. 

  
Unlike other frameworks, Letta is very focused on persistence and havi
ng 'agents-as-a-service'. This means that all state (including messages, tools, memory, etc.) is all persisted in a DB. 
So all agent state is essentially automatically save across sessions (and even if you re-start the server). We also have
 an ADE (Agent Development Environment) to easily view and iterate on your agent design. 

  
I've seen a lot of people 
posting here about using agent framework like Langchain, CrewAI, etc. -- we haven't marketed that much in general but th
ought the course might be interesting to people here!

```
Hi Folks,   
I have a bunch of pdfs that I need to process and build a RAG application (hopefully!). 

I tried several p
df processors - pdfplumber, pypdf, pymupdf4llm, etc. But noticing a very weird behavior. Somehow, a bullet point with a 
few spaces is getting converted to a new line.

for e.g - 

'2.     abc',  

in the pdf will get converted to -

'2.

ab
c' after processing.    
What am I missing? 

    class PDFProcessor:
        def __init__(self, pdf_path):
            
self.pdf_path = pdf_path
    
        def get_text(self):
            loader = PyMuPDFLoader(self.pdf_path)
            
self.data = loader.load()
            all_page_data = ''
            for page in self.data:
                all_page_dat
a += page.page_content
    
    
            # self.data = pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(self.pdf_path)
            self.all_p
age_data = all_page_data
            return self.data

all -  [ Issues with Chain Customization | LangChain Natural language to SQL Query ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1gls1kt/issues_with_chain_customization_langchain_natural/) , 2024-11-08-0912
```
I’ve been working on building a LangChain setup that performs a full SQL query process in multiple steps:
1. Generate SQ
L Query - Create an SQL query based on the user’s input.
2. Validate the Query - Prompt the LLM with the original user q
uestion and database context, and validate the generated query.
3. Execute the Query - Run the validated query and store
 the results.
4. Convert to Natural Language - Take the SQL result and reformat it for a human-readable response.

Howev
er, I’m running into issues with LangChain’s intermediate steps. Specifically:
• create_sql_query_chain only seems to ac
cept “query” as input, but I’d like to pass a custom variable name like unvalidated_query to the validation step.
• For 
the validation prompt, it only takes inputs passed to the main invoke() function, so I’m unable to customize input/outpu
t names at each step.

Here’s the chain I’m trying to build:

‘’’
validated_query_chain = validation_prompt | llm | StrO
utputParser()

final_chain = RunnablePassthrough.assign(
    query=create_sql_query_chain, 
    validated_query=validate
d_query_chain,
    result=execute_query_chain
) | {
    'answer': answer_back_to_natural_language_prompt | llm | StrOutp
utParser(),
    'query': query,
    'validated_query': validated_query
 }
‘’’

The goal is to have the chain return the 
initial query, validated query, and final answer in natural language. Any insights on customizing LangChain’s built-in f
unction names or managing input/output variables for each step?

all -  [ Customizing LLM templates with YAML configuration files- without altering Python scripts. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1glq66t/customizing_llm_templates_with_yaml_configuration/) , 2024-11-08-0912
```
Hey everyone,

I’ve been deploying RAG applications in production, especially when dealing with data sources that freque
ntly change (like files being added, updated, or deleted by multiple team members).

However, spending time tweaking Pyt
hon scripts is a hassle. For example, if you have swap a model or change the type of index.

To tackle this, we’ve creat
ed an open-source repository that provides YAML templates to simplify RAG deployment without the need to modify code eac
h time. You can check it out here: [llm-app GitHub Repo](https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app).

Here’s how it helps:


* **Swap components easily**, like switching data sources from local files to SharePoint or Google Drive, changing model
s, or swapping indexes from a vector index to a hybrid index.
* **Change parameters in RAG pipelines via readable YAML f
iles.**
* **Keep configurations clean and organized**, making it easier to manage and update.

For more details, there’s
 also a [blog post](https://pathway.com/blog/llm-yaml-templates) and a [detailed guide](https://pathway.com/developers/u
ser-guide/llm-xpack/yaml-templates) that explain how to customize the templates.

This approach has significantly stream
lined my workflow.   
Would love to hear your feedback, experiences or any tips you might have!

Automated machine learning (AutoML) tools like DataRobot and [H2O.ai](http://H2O.a
i) are reshaping how models are created. These platforms streamline the machine learning process by automating feature e
ngineering, model selection, and tuning, saving you hours of manual work.

**8. LangChain and Hugging Face Transformers*
*

For NLP tasks, Hugging Face has become a go-to resource, offering a library of pre-trained models that can be fine-tu
ned for specific tasks. LangChain has gained popularity for building applications that rely on language models, such as 
chatbots and RAG systems, making it easier to work with conversational AI.

**9. Alteryx and KNIME**

If you're looking 
for powerful, no-code/low-code solutions for data analytics, Alteryx and KNIME are top choices in 2024. Both platforms a
llow for data blending, cleaning, and analytics without needing extensive programming knowledge. They’re excellent for t
eams that want to leverage AI without investing heavily in coding skills.

**10. Experiment Tracking with MLflow and Wei
ghts & Biases**

As ML projects grow in complexity, tracking experiments becomes essential. MLflow and Weights & Biases 
offer robust solutions for tracking model parameters, performance metrics, and dataset versions, making it easier to man
age experiments and collaborate with other data scientists.

**Conclusion**

The landscape of AI tools is constantly evo
lving, but staying on top of these powerful resources can make all the difference in your data science projects. Which A
I tools are your favorites? Are there any you’re excited to try in 2024? Share your thoughts in the comments below!

User makes an LLM call. LLM returns a JSON . These JSON values get prepopulated in the form. All of

I've posted this in Streamlit community forum and their subreddit but it may take years to get a good rep

I tried two approache
s currently -
1. Non agentic using chains
2. Agentic

In both since we need to make multiple calls to llm and also token
s are more so cost incurred is higher. In general the agentic approach takes more cost as most of the decision making is
 left to it. 

So i wanted to discuss if anyone has worked on a similar problem on production scale and what things shou

```
**I want to create a few simple AI tools** (similar to twitterbio.io for example). Basically I get text from the user an
d based on custom prompts/instructions I give them a list of ideas (text generated with OpenAI API). I might want to acc
ept also URLs, images and PDFs as inputs.

Some of my tools will be free and open. Others will be paid (monthly subscrip
tion), so **I need payments, authentication, etc.**

**I guess the quickest option would be to use some boilerplate or t
emplate**. I’ve done some research, but I’m completely lost between dozens of options: SaaS boilerplates, AI-specific bo
ilerplates, Github templates from Vercel/Langchain/others, templates or kits from Backend as a Service providers (Supaba
se/Firebase), frameworks with many “batteries included” such as Laravel…

I know some basic Python and HTML/CSS. Nothing
 else. I want to learn and also experiment with AI coding helpers (Cursor? Replit AI? v0?), but not spend several months
 before launching if possible. So **I want something easy to start, but also flexible** (being able to add features and 
make changes in the future without having to “fight” with the limitations of a certain boilerplate or whatever).

**What
 do you recommend?**

```
I’ve got a pipeline with 5 different agent calls, and I need to scale for at least 50-60 simultaneous users. I’m hosting
 Ollama, using Llama 3.2 90B, Codestral, and some SLM. Data security is a key factor here, which is why I can’t rely on 
widely available APIs like ChatGPT, Claude, or others.

Groq.com offers data security, but their on-demand API isn’t ava
ilable yet, and I can't opt for their enterprise solution.

So, is it cheaper to go with an on-premise GPU server, or sh
ould I stick with the cloud? And if on-premise, what are the scaling limitations I need to consider? Let’s break it down
!

Imagine you had a genie who could solve any problem you wanted...

Now, let's convert this wish-making concept into real
ity: What kind of AI agent would you love to see created? It could be something to solve your own challenges, help other
s, or tackle any interesting task you can imagine!

I can help make this happen!

I’m running a global online hackathon 
in conjunction with #LangChain, which has nearly 700 registrations so far, and many participants are looking for project
 ideas. Since the hackathon rules allow creating any AI agent you can imagine, this could be a win-win situation - share
 your ideas for AI agents, and maybe someone will make your wish come true!

Share your ideas in the comments below for 
any AI agents or problems you'd like solved, and I'll pass all these ideas to our participants.

```
Hey! I’ve been building a simple framework called Dendrite for interacting with websites using natural language. Instead
 of having to find brittle css selectors or xpaths you can describe them with natural language.

`browser.click(“the sig
n in button”)`

The selectors are then cached so the next time you want to get an element you don’t need any interferenc
e. For the developers who like their code typed, specify what data you want with a Pydantic BaseModel and Dendrite retur
ns it in that format with one simple function call. Built on top of playwright for a robust experience. This is an easy 
way to give your AI agents the same web browsing capabilities as humans have. Integrates easily with frameworks such as 
 Langchain, CrewAI, Llamaindex and more.

I’m planning on **open sourcing** everything the coming month so feel free to 
reach out if you’re interested in contributing

Hi everyone,

I'm new to LLM and RAG. I had built RAG once, but the data source is limited to PDF with a few pages only,
 when I try to scale the source to a book of hundreds of pages (world of warcraft lore), the retrieval result is not goo
d. I have tried with semantic chunking, but the speed is too slow, and the result is not better than recursive chunking.


I'm thinking on using another language model to summarize each chapter, but i think it may cause misinformation, since
 some small details can be bypass in this stage.

Are there any methods you guys know about ? Or some papers to solve th
is problem ?

Thanks everyone.

**I want to create a few simple AI tools** (similar to twitterbio.io for example). Basically I get text from the user an

Ls, images and PDFs as inputs.

Some of my tools will be free and open. Others will be paid (monthly subscription), so *
*I need payments, authentication, etc.**

**I guess the quickest option would be to use some boilerplate or template**. 
I’ve done some research, but I’m completely lost between dozens of options: SaaS boilerplates, AI-specific boilerplates,
 Github templates from Vercel/Langchain/others, templates or kits from Backend as a Service providers (Supabase/Firebase
), frameworks with many “batteries included” such as Laravel…

I know some basic Python and HTML/CSS. Nothing else. I wa
nt to learn and also experiment with AI coding helpers (Cursor? Replit AI? v0?), but not spend several months before lau

Hi,

I'm trying to build a prompt compression logic using vector embeddings and similarity search. My goal is to save to

uld be particularly useful when approaching token limits in consecutive messages.

I was wondering if something like thi

 this even considered a common approach? Ideally, I'm looking for something that takes OpenAI messages format as input a

I'm building a chatbot using RAG to answer general information queries for a health-related website, such as 'What are c

e answers that don’t require user-specific information.

However, I also want the bot to handle member-specific requests
, like 'Show my latest lab results' or 'When is my next scheduled appointment?' For these personalized queries, I plan t
o use OpenAI's function calling to connect with an external API and fetch user-specific data securely.

  
I'm looking f
or advice on how to structure this system so that it can:

1. **Accurately classify** incoming queries as either general
 information (handled by RAG) or user-specific (requiring function calling).
2. **Route queries accordingly** to either 
the RAG model or an API call, without requiring user intervention.

```
Apologies if some of this doesn't make sense, I'm pretty new to Python and Langchain so please bear with me. 

Earlier t
his year I created a simple RAG chatbot using Langchain and Chainlit. The embeddings were stored in a pgvector enabled P
ostgres database in GCP Cloud SQL. I packaged it up in a container and hosted it on GCP Cloud Run. It worked great.

I'm
 trying to create a new chatbot using a new dataset but the same architecture as the previous one. I've updated Langchai
n and it seems some of the code from my previous chatbot is no longer working. Here's the portion I'm struggling with. T
his is a bit of code from the OLD chatbot that worked fine:

    store = PGVector(
        collection_name=COLLECTION_NA
ME,
        connection_string=CONNECTION_STRING,
        embedding_function=embeddings,
    )
    
    retriever = store
.as_retriever()
    
    template = '''My system prompt
    Context: {context}
    Question: {question}
    '''    
    

    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)
        
    chain = (
        {'context': retriever, 'question
': RunnablePassthrough()}
    | prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser())

I should also point out that the above chatbo
t was written for Gemini, prior to when Gemini supported a system prompt so I had to convert the first human message to 
system.

Here's the same bit of code from the NEW chatbot that I'm trying to create. I'm using a different ChatPromptTem
plate method because Gemini now supports a system prompt and from\_messages is giving me better results than from\_templ
ate. So the only thing that has changed is changing the ChatPromptTemplate from from\_template to from\_messages, but no
w I'm not sure how to structure the actual chain. I've tried a few things but nothing is working. Any ideas?

I also wan
t to point out that the code below works perfectly fine as-is (well, the entire file obviously), without the retriever. 
I can do a chainlit run [main.py](http://main.py) on this file and it launches Chainlit and I can have a conversation wi
th Gemini. The only thing I'm struggling with is how to insert the retriever into the chain.



    store = PGVector(
  
      collection_name-COLLECTION_NAME,
        connection_string=CONNECTION_STRING,
        embedding_function=embedding
s,
    )
    
    retriever = store.as_retriever()
    
    system_template = '''My system template'''
    
    prompt_t
emplate = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
        [('system', system_template), ('user', '{text}')]
    )
    
    run
nable = prompt_template | model | StrOutputParser()

**Overview**

* **Authenticate Anywhere**: Dendrite Vault, 
our Chrome extension, handles secure authentication, letting your agents log in to almost any website.
* **Interact Natu
rally**: With natural language commands, agents can click, type, and navigate through web elements with ease.
* **Extrac
t and Manipulate Data**: Collect structured data from websites, return data from different websites in the same structur
e without having to maintain different scripts.
* **Download/Upload Files**: Effortlessly manage file interactions to an
d from websites, equipping agents to handle documents, reports, and more.
* **Resilient Interactions**: Dendrite's inter
actions are designed to be resilient, adapting to minor changes in website structure to prevent workflows from breaking

* **Full Compatibility**: Works with popular tools like LangChain and CrewAI, letting you seamlessly integrate Dendrite’
s capabilities into your AI workflows.

**Target Audience:**

* Automation developers
* Webscraping people
* Web AI agen
t developers
* QA engineers

**Comparison:**

There are some frameworks for scraping information from websites with natu
ral language prompts but there are no real alternatives when it comes to interacting with the websites as well as access
ing data behind authentication. The most similar alternative would be something like Multion or some other fully autonom
ous agent framework that doesn't really work

```
I have created vector embeddings of codebase (C/C++ files) and stored them, using the tree sitter and Generic Loader fro
m langchain, by referring this

https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/source_code/

Currently 
I'm using db.as_retriever({search_type='mmr'}) for retrieving the function definitions (because most of the queries will
 be dependent of their definition: find the bug in abc_function) and for some of the functions it is working as expected
 since those functions aren't used much in the codebase, so retrieving the correct chunk is easier with them, but the fu
nctions which are called in multiple functions, for them this retriever isn't able to retrieve their function definition
s

Are there any specific retrievers for the codebase? Like tree-sitter is for parsing the codebase?

```
📚 Hierarchical indices are an advanced method for organizing information in RAG systems. Unlike traditional flat structu
res, they use a multi-tiered approach typically consisting of:

1. Top-level summaries
2. Mid-level overviews
3. Detaile
d chunks

✨ This hierarchical structure helps overcome common RAG limitations by:
• Improving context understanding 
• B
etter handling complex queries
• Enhancing scalability
• Increasing answer relevance

Attached is the full blog describi
ng it, which includes link to code implementation as well ☺️
