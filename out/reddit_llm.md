Hey there! I'm Diego,

Are you drowning in boring tasks or dreaming up with exciting projects? Let me bring some coding 
magic to the table with Python.

With over 4 years of experience, I've worked in a variety of projects, including automa
tion, chatbots, APIs, web development, web scraping, and more!

# What can I do for you?

* **Automate the boring stuff*
*: Say goodbye to repetitive tasks!
* **Build Chatbots**: Want a digital buddy? I can make that happen.
* **Build your w
eb app:**Â Time to build the next big thing together.
* **Grab data from websites**: Web scraping made easy.
* **Work wit
h AI**: Using cool stuff like Langchain or the Chat-GPT API.

If you believe you have something that I could do for you,
 please place a $bid and send me the details of the project. As always, the price depends, but It's usually from 15$ to 
20$ for simple or intermediate projects.

```
I've got a csv file of quotes in relation to jurisprudence. Basing my code off of ChatGPT's API, I want to retain conver
sational functionality and if the user asks a question, the AI should return the exact result as it is from the database
 (ranked by similarity) along with a brief explanation. I tried vectorizing with a couple different things, some of whic
h were good but ultimately weren't close enough to the level of precision I wanted. After researching a bit, I thought o
f simply having ChatGPT pull it out of the csv file in plaintext but is that at all possible?

```
Hi everyone,

Iâ€™m working on a RAG project where I need to retrieve and embed both Markdown tables and free text from Qd
rant. The data comes from PDF documents and I've already converted the tables of the PDF documents into Markdown tables 
for the knowledge base.

I need an effective way to retrieve tables stored in Qdrant or any other technologies when need
ed. I'm worried normal embedding wouldn't work properly for not free text such as tables.

Iâ€™m currently using LangChain
 for data processing. Any guidance on integrating Qdrant and LangChain to achieve this, or alternative approaches and to
ols that might simplify the process, would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your help!

```
Hey, i hope this is the right sub.

  
A customer asked me to develop an ai tool that takes advertising brochures, scans
 through them and extracts information about the products and then parses them into structured data. At first i thought 
about classic OCR but in my first testings the results weren't that good, probably because of the rather complex layouts
 in those kind of documents (i've attached an example). I did some research on ai ocr but i am not really sure what to u
se or if this is even the right approach. Maybe ocr models arent even the best approach, maybe there are  image analysis
 models that are better suited for this?  
My idea is to use an ai model to extract the data and then chain it with anot
her llm that outputs the data in a structured way.   


Do you guys have any ideas how to approach this? Any help is ver
y welcomed!

Good afternoon. 
I am studying about implementing a chatbot that follows a conversational flow. I am from Brazil and I d

But I need the chatbot to answer customer questions and also ask questio

Any light on what to research

Hello everyone and thank you for letting me post this.

We have recently released a new book that I would love to share 
with the community: AI Apps with LangChain, by Roberto Infante.  
  
ðŸ“š Our latest MEAP (Manning Early Access Program) re
lease includes clear diagrams and numerous code samples to guide you in building useful LangChain-based AI apps. The boo
k will help you develop effectiveÂ LLM-powered projects, such as a simple document summarization tool, a reliable web-bas
ed research assistant, a semantic search chatbot, and advancedÂ RAG.

***AI Apps with LangChain***Â demystifies the most complex techniques of building LLM-based
 applications, including deploying open-source LLMs locally and fine-tuning them for specific applications. Youâ€™ll start
 from the ground up: LLM architecture, how to adapt them to your needs, and the advanced prompt engineering techniques y
ouâ€™ll need to succeed. From there, youâ€™ll quickly move on to developing effective LLM-powered projectsâ€”from a simple too
l to summarize documents, to a research assistant that can reliably use the web, a semantic search chatbot, and implemen
ting advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation.

About the author:  
**Roberto Infante**Â has been developing software prof
essionally for over 25 years, primarily for financial institutions including investment banks, asset managers, brokers,

all -  [ We responded to all your feedbacks on my earlier Langchain project sharing on r/Langchain!! â€” JENOVA ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1f2hfl5/we_responded_to_all_your_feedbacks_on_my_earlier/) , 2024-08-28-0911
```
HeyÂ r/Langchain, a few weeks ago I shared my Langchain projectÂ [JENOVA](https://www.jenova.ai/)Â in thisÂ [post](https://w
ww.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1ellpk9/sharing_my_project_that_was_built_on_langchain_an/), which received 12k views
 and 90% upvote rate. To quickly describe what JENOVA does, it's an all-in-one AI assistant that intelligently routes yo
ur queries to the foundation model (e.g. GPT, Claude, Gemini) that can provide the answer and is complemented with tools
 such as web browsing and document upload.

 In that post many of you gave some extremely useful feedback and suggestion
s for the project, and just this weekend we rolled out some major improvements in response your feedback:

* **By far th
e #1 biggest feedback from users is to show what models JENOVA used to generate each response.**Â We delivered by display
ing the model underneath each JENOVA response appears when you hover over the message on desktop/tap the message on mobi
le. This way JENOVA can maintain its design philosophy of simplicity/cleanness while also providing the requested techni
cal information.

https://preview.redd.it/zatk6ydjn7ld1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3f43ce156972fe84712e1ff97
413e166a8e25b2

* **Whenever JENOVA references the information from the internet, it will now always cite the source and
 include the hyperlink.**

https://preview.redd.it/8tgkq8vln7ld1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=31e363d6154b495db
d99d531a575aaacac59d2f0

* On the mobile web version of JENOVA, whenever you hit enter in the input box, it will create 
a new line rather than send message (one of the best quality of life improvements for mobile AI experience).
* We reduce
d the likelihood that JENOVA performs unnecessary web search.
* You can now enter message in the input box and attached 
files while JENOVA is still processing its response.
* Added detection mechanism where if one provider's LLM goes down (
e.g. Claude API went down last week), we can quickly switch to another provider's LLM to ensure service continuation.
* 
We fixed the issue where every time new code was deployed, users are automatically signed out.
* Added sample prompts on
 the new chat page.
* Another big feedback was to add login options other than Google SSO (mainly regular email sign in)
, we haven't had the capacity to implement this yet but it is on our soon-to-do list.

Over the past week there had been
 long periods where the response speed of JENOVA was very slow. This slowness was caused by instability of Claude API. W
e're monitoring this situation closely and it seems that in the past 24 hour Claude API has been relatively stable and f
ast.

Thanks for your support and we welcome any other feedbacks and suggestions! Also please join our growing Reddit co
mmunity atÂ !!

```
I am planning to build a RAG web app, but I am confused about which one should I go for. For my web app I will be workin
g on JavaScript mainly, so should I build my own RAG system in javascript or use third party library like lanchchain or 
llamaindex using python?

Many people here on Reddit suggest avoiding wrappers like langchain and use your own RAG syste
m, if so, then should I build my own text splitter, loaders, retrievers and other parts of RAG or use some parts from la
ngchain and build some myself?

How do you guys build your RAG apps, especially that can scale well? What database do yo
u use? I am use postgresql with pgvector.

I created a RAG pipeline using phi3 from ollama. But even if the context is not relevant to the query the model is reply

any good prompt for rag? may be have experienced creating rag using phi3? I really need some help.

```
I am making a website where the UI is populated by text generated by an LLM through structured JSON, where each attribut
e given is a specific text field in the UI. The LLM returns structured JSON given a theme, and so far I have used OpenAI
's API. However, the LLM usually returns quite generic and unsatisfactory output. 

I have a few examples (around 15) of
 theme-expected JSON output pairings. How should I incorporate these examples into the LLM? The first thought I had woul
d be to include these examples in the pre-prompt, but I feel like so many tokens would downgrade the performance a bit. 
The other idea would be to fine-tune the LLM using these examples, but I don't know if 15 is enough examples to make a d
ifference. Can LangChain help in any way? I thought also of using the LangChain context, where the examples are sent int
o an embedding space and the most appropriate one is retrieved after a query to feed into the LLM pre-prompt, but even i
n this case I don't know how much better the output would be.

Just to clarify, it's of course difficult to say that the
 LLM output is 'bad' or 'generic' but what I mean is that it is quite far from what I would expect it to return.

all -  [ How to debug prompts? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LlamaIndex/comments/1f2apo9/how_to_debug_prompts/) , 2024-08-28-0911
```
Hello! I am using langchain and the OpenAI API (sometimes with gpt4-o, sometimes with local LLMs exposing this API via O
llama), and I am a bit concerned with the different chat formats that different LLMs are fine tuned with. I am thinking 
about special tokens like `<|start\_header\_id|>` and things like that. Not all LLMs are created equal. So I would like 
to have the option (with langchain and openai API) to visualize the full prompt that the LLM is receiving. The problem w
ith having so many abstraction layers is that this is not easy to achieve, and I am struggling with it. I would like to 
know if anyone has a nice way of dealing with this problem. There is a solution that should work, but I hope I don't nee
d to go that far, which is creating a proxy server that listens to the requests, logs them and redirects them as they go
 to the real openai API endpoint. 

Thanks in advance!

all -  [ Best way to make LLM response context aware with spreadsheet data ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1f1xsx5/best_way_to_make_llm_response_context_aware_with/) , 2024-08-28-0911
```
I'm having question marks on my approach and would love your expert opinion here: I'm developing a tool for electronics 
engineers where users input the name of a custom device and its components (Bill of Materials) into the system.
The tool
 then needs to generate a list of all manufacturing and assembly activities required to produce the device, intelligentl
y matching components to these activities. Additionally, it should generate a comprehensive list of any remaining inputs
 and outputs based on a predefined dataset of electronics manufacturing activities and components ('Electronics_Manufact
uring_Data.csv'). So the LLM response need to be context aware of the dataset and conform to the items in this dataset.

I'm wondering whether to implement this using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)/Fine tune/ or if transforming the dat
a into SQL for querying would be a better approach, or if there's another technique that might be more effective?

```
I've been working on creating an SQL agent in Langchain using OpenAI, and everything was running smoothly. However, when
 I switched to using a local Ollama LLM, things started to fall apart.

I tried using `AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIP
TION`, but I kept running into an error: **'Invalid Format: Missing 'Action Input:' after 'Action:''**. The agent would 
generate thoughts and actions, but it always failed with this error and never returned any results. I also attempted to 
use `AgentType='tool_calling'`, but that didnâ€™t work either.

At first, I thought it might be an issue with the model si
ze, so I upgraded to a larger 70B model, but still no luck. Interestingly, when I tested the same SQL agent with the ReA
ctAgent in LlamaIndex, it worked for simple queries. However, it struggles with more complex queries, often going into a
 loop and eventually failing.

Has anyone else experienced similar issues? Iâ€™m looking for guidance on how to create an 
SQL agent that works without relying on LlamaIndex or Langchain. Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated!

I'm trying to decide the best way to implement this. Should I use the SQL Chain feature from LangChain to interact dir
ectly with the table, or would it be better to store these issues in a text file and update my indexes each time there's
 a change?

I'd appreciate any insights or suggestions on which approach might be more efficient or easier to manage. Th

Hi

I have used same chunks and tested against 2 embedding models: Voyage 2 in Pinecone DB and then S3 buckets and Titan
 Embeddings. I see a big difference between the relevancy scores of Voyage2/Pinecone and S3/Titan with the Titan having 
lower scores. 

For example, the first chunk retrieved from Pinecone/Voyage had a 0.82 and S3/Titan had a 0.5 and it was
 the same chunk,same query. i'm using langchain's AmazonKnowledgeBasesRetriever for S3/Titan and for pinecone: docsearch
.similarity\_search\_with\_score. Ideally I could increase the score from the AWS setup.

Did anybody have similar issue
s and can explain why such a big difference and where to look to improve?

Hi all, I'm working on a side project that helps with sports analysis for historical games, which in turn will help with
 sports betting. Currently I've been only focused on MLB because I wanted to see how the use case would pan out.

My fir
st attempt at this was to use the openai endpoint and load all the relevant JSON objects and send a prompt along with th
em to GPT and see what I get back. Eventually, the context size was getting way too big and the problem I was running in
to was that it was expensive. Although, the prompts back were actually pretty decent and relevant to the data.

My secon
d attempt was to setup a RAG using Chroma/LangChain/GPT4o. I got it to work but the answers all seem very off and super 
vague. None of the data I have was shown in any of the prompts i asked, or any of the players that were playing in a gam
e were mentioned at all in the prompt back, plus it kept mentioning wrong games/teams whe asking it specific games. Iâ€™m 
assuming I might need to adjust the vector store a bit but not sure how I can do that with chroma.

My question is what 
might be the best way to setup some sort of process? My end result, I would like a response back using the historical da
ta I've provided to make assumptions on what a game could be like based off all the stats given, with some room for GPT 
to also make some inference as well.

I am a super new at this so it's been a learning process so far; please bear with 
me.

```
So me and my friend completed the ML and DL specialization by AndrewNg, and were just gonna get started on a project. We
 decided to make a academic assistant. So basically what this does is a user can upload a PDF,text file or any other sup
ported media and the can ask questions related to it's contents. The main objective being making learning quick given la
rger documents.

The pipeline we decided is pretty standard for such a project.

1. Split the text into chunks
2. Genera
te embeddings of the chunks
3. Store the chunks in a vector DB
4. Find the top K similar chunks to the query 
5. Retriev
e context and feed it into a LLM for an answer.

So I looked up for a library and framework to use and decided on langch
ain. We haven't decided on an LLM yet but want to run it locally so no OpenAI please. 

Since this is gonna be out first
 AI project confidence is low. I would really appreciate any heads up on the issues we may face, any suggestions on libr
aries,frameworks or models will be really helpful as well. 

Appreciate any resourceful comment ðŸ˜Š

TL;DR: RAG overcomes the limitations of LLMs by bringing in external sources of information as relevant context.  
  

At the end of the step-by-step tutorial, you will be able to give your favorite LLM (ChatGPT, LLAMA 3, Mixtral, Gemini, 
Claude, etc.) some documents, ask it a question and see it respond based on relevant context.  
  
This will be running 
locally, using open-source libraries. Zero API and tooling costs.

deeplearning -  [ Need help with creating CLI for 'non-programmers' (LLMs) ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1elrfgm/need_help_with_creating_cli_for_nonprogrammers/) , 2024-08-28-0911
```
***TL;DR*** What is the best way to convert user input into sequence of commands and their corresponding parameters? Lik
e, imagine you are not a programmer and there is a console app with a CLI, but, well, you don't know the structure and t
he syntax of commands. And you don't want to know. YBut! You have a locally running instance of llama3.1 -- or whatever 
open LLM is out there now -- and you can ask it to create a CLI command for you. What would you do to accomplish that?


**Intro**

A little bit of context. I'm working on a project that targets scientists as end users. It has some UI using 
which it's possible to do all sort of things the lab workers would like to do. But recently the projects product owner d
ecided that it would be cool to have a small chat window that is accessable basically everywhere throughout the applicat
ion UI in which 'lives' a bot that can accept some input from a user and do what is requested. The pool of commands is f
inite and predefined.

**The issue**

So, putting details aside, the main issue to be solved is parsing user input (unst
ructured and possible incomplete data) to some structured form. In general, each and every user input should be transfor
med into a data structure that represents a sequence of commands with their parameters, for example:

User input: Please
, create X with param1 set to value1 and param2 equal to value2

Desired output:

    create_x --param1 value1 --param2 
value2

In this example, there is only one command, but in real life the request can represent a sequence of N commands,
 and they may depend on each other (sequence of execution does matter)

**What I've tried so far**

I have an 'experimen
t' environment: a python project with `ollama` and `langchain` installed. The main model I test is llama3.1-instruct wit
h 5bit quantization. (I'm sort of limited with hardware resourses, so XXB parameter models do not fit).

Up until now, I
've tried to achieve what I want with prompting in different forms, but in general I do the following:

1. As the very f
irst message in the chat, I create a 'system' one which explain what commands are there. The format is the following (I 
replaced original data not to expose the context more, so it's very generic): 

```xml
<scope>
    <models>
        <mod
el name='entityA'>
            <field name='uniqueId' type='string' description='unique identifier for entityA'/>
      
      <field name='label' type='string' description='label for entityA'/>
            <field name='category' type='enum'
 possible-value='alpha, beta, gamma, delta'/>
        </model>
        <model name='entityB'>
            <field name='u
niqueId' description='unique identifier for entityB'/>
            <field name='entityAIds' type='array' description='id
entifiers of entityAs associated with this entityB'/>
        </model>
    </models>
    <commands>
        <command nam
e='create_entityA' description='creates an instance of entityA'>
            <param name='uniqueId' type='string' descri
ption='unique identifier for entityA'/>
            <param name='label' type='string' description='label for entityA' re
quired='true'/>
            <param name='category' type='enum' possible-values='alpha, beta, gamma, delta'
             
      description='category of entityA (one value from the possible values list)' required='true'/>
        </command>
 
       <command name='remove_entityA' description='removes an instance of entityA by its unique identifier'>
           
 <param name='uniqueId' description='unique identifier of the entityA to be removed'
                   required='true'/
>
        </command>
        <command name='create_entityB'>
            <param name='label' description='label for enti
tyB'/>
        </command>
        <command name='link_entityAs_to_entityB'
                 description='associates inst
ances of entityA with a specific entityB based on the provided unique identifier of entityB'>
            <param name='u
niqueId' description='unique identifier of the entityB to which entityAs should be associated'
                   requir
ed='true'/>
            <param name='entityAIds'
                   description='an array of unique identifiers of entit
yAs to associate with the entityB'
                   type='array'
                   required='true'/>
        </comman
d>
        <command name='navigate' description='indicates that a user wants to go to a specific section of the platform
'>
            <param name='section' possible-values='entitiesA, entitiesB, configuration' required='true'/>
        </c
ommand>
        <command name='support' description='should be executed when a user seeks assistance on available functi
ons'/>
    </commands>
</scope>
```

So, now the model is provided with some context. Then, also in the 'system' message
 I:

* 'tell' the model that user input should be converted into a sequence of commands along with the corresponding par
ameters, all of this is described in the XML above
* describe the desired output format
* try to enforce some restrictio
n and cover edge cases

**The question part**

*Is this approach* ***viable***\*?\*

If yes, maybe there are some ***way
s to improve it***?

If not, *what would be* ***the alternative***?

So far I don't see how to apply fine tuning here

T
hank you in advance!
