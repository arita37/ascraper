```
I've been working at a bank in Canada since March after I finished my courses in December, however, I would like to work
 in an actual tech company.  

I want to target Software Development Roles, although I would prefer Machine Learning rol
es or a mix of both. I have two resumes, one for SWE and another for ML. **In the whole time I have applied I've never g
otten interviews for ML roles**. I assume I probably need a Masters degree and publications, but I want to get my perman
ent residence first before applying to Masters as I am not a citizen of Canada.

My ML resume has two pages as it has mo
re keywords for the AI parser.

Looking for jobs anywhere in Canada/USA.

Also I have a couple of project ideas I want t
o implement but haven't had the time and I might as well target AI roles. One is a sort of Scrum Master AI Agent where I
 plan to use LangChain, LangGraph, Vector Databases and LLMs to help me break down my projects into tasks and sprints.  
 
The other idea is a knowledge management AI agent that builds a knowledge base/documentation from all discussions I ha
ve with ChatGPT. It would use AWS, Pinecone, LangChain and perhaps MongoDB. I thought the keywords would look good on my
 resume. 

Any feedback is appreciated :) 

I would particularly appreciate feedback regarding which sections to include
/remove for my AI resume, which I might use to target both AI+SWE roles.

PS: I know I should include a brief header on 
the second page of my AI resume.

```
Hello community. I am new to the world of LLMs and am building a system that uses them to help build a job descriptor as
istant within my company. 

The job description structure has 11 sections (I have a 3 page manual with a description of 
each one). 

The initial prompt is somewhat extensive, and if I wanted to implement it as a chat to assists users, I und
erstand that each time they will interact with the LLM, it would involve sending the entire initial prompt + all the int
ermediate conversations. Is this correct? Is there a way for the history to remain in the LLM and the consumption of inp
ut tokens to be only the new questions?

Thank you!

```
Hi everyone,

With the rise of AI agents and recent advancements in agentic research, my friend and I wanted to explore 
whether we could develop a tool to automate parts of penetration testing. This led to the creation of TARS a few months 
ago.

TARS is our attempt to automate parts of cybersecurity penetration testing using AI agents by utilizing LangChain,
 CrewAI, and GPT-4. We've integrated tools that allow TARS to utilize Nettacker, RustScan, ZAP, Nmap, and web browsing v
ia the Brave API & Selenium.

Recently, we decided to make TARS accessible to everyone without any restrictions, so we o
pen-sourced TARS under the MIT license. We see the value in TARS's ability to generate general reports from surface-leve
l scans and its potential to perform unique attacks based on the model you're using.

Since TARS is in early development
 and still experimental, we'd greatly appreciate your feedback.

You can check out TARS here: [https://github.com/osgil-
defense/TARS](https://github.com/osgil-defense/TARS)

And view some demos of TARS here:

```
Ragable is an open-source library to help you build RAG apps faster. The library takes care of bare essentials such as:


1. Parse PDF, DOCX, TEXT files, and more into vector embeddings.
2. Store and query data from Qdrant.
3. Agent support.
 A basic and easy-to-use framework for building LLM agents. Agents can call pure Python functions. Easy to pass informat
ion around without complex wrapper libraries.

I built Ragable to make my life easy; previously I used Langchain, which 
to be honest is a superb library but it tends to get overcomplicated very quickly. I needed a simple framework to build 
upon, and have full control on what the library is doing.

all -  [ Issue when implementing RAG - Rerank system ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1f38qax/issue_when_implementing_rag_rerank_system/) , 2024-08-29-0912
```
* **Context**:

I'm currently building an LLM RAG for an enterprise in finance. They need this system to help them with 
the paperwork. Specifically, to retrieve documents relevant to the given question and the user.

They want the system to
 be able to adapt to the questions and the law domain using user feedback, so we added a Rerank model and trained the mo
del using customer feedback.

The LLM response is pretty simple, always display the top 5 docs in a markdown table (show
 some metadata of the doc) and they want to use GPT4-o for reasoning and rating the relevance of each of the 10 docs com
pared to the question.

For example:  
doc 1: summary Conf: 100%  
doc 2: summary Conf: 90%  
doc 3: summary Conf: 80%  

doc 4: summary Conf: 20%  
doc 5: summary Conf: 0%

The reason why they have to combine with LLM instead of just using 
a Cross-encoder to rank the relevance is they want the LLM to summarize and reason the document content, so they don't h
ave to go through the whole document to evaluate.

Users can look at this rating and re-rate it according to their logic
 (but 90% of the time they will just rely on GPT4 reasoning). All of this data will be automatically saved and used to t
rain the model.

* **How they test the rerank quality:**

The customer doesn't have ground truth data to train and on ou
r side, we have very little knowledge in finance. They manually ask one question and make the GPT4 rate the top 50 most 
relevant documents returned by the original rerank model, the result ranges from 0-100%, then train the rerank model usi
ng those data.  
To the customer and other members of my team, their expectation is after using the rerank model, the to
p 10 docs in the response should be **evaluated with confidence 100% by the GPT** and **none of the 0% docs should have 
appeared in the top 10**. Like this:

doc 1: summary Conf: 100%  
doc 6: summary Conf: 100%  
doc 11: summary Conf: 100%
  
doc 12: summary Conf: 100%  
doc 15: summary Conf: 90%

In reality, the result returns like this:

doc 1: summary Con
f: 100%  
doc 6: summary Conf: 100%  
doc 70: summary Conf: 100%  
doc 77: summary Conf: 100%  
doc 90: summary Conf: 0%


Some of the 100% rated docs appear in the top 10, many of them are not even in the original top 50 but still get reran
k to 10, and one of the latest top 10 is even rated with 0% relevance by GPT. They don't even look at the GPT reasoning 
and the content of the docs, just focus on the GPT confidence.

* **My problem is:**

I'm the only AI Engineer on this p
roject and everyone else (including PM and the customer, a full-stack, and QA) doesn't have background knowledge of Deep
 Learning. They expect the rerank model to adapt with just a few samples of data and take effect immediately (<100 sampl
es) then return docs that will be rated \~100% by the GPT. They say the rerank model is not working properly.

I have sp
ent a lot of time explaining to them that's not how DNN works and expecting the model to make any significant changes wi
th just a few data samples is not realistic, and the quality of the model also depends on the quality of the training da
ta. I looked at the GPT response closely, many 0% rated have very stupid responses and should be 100% instead, and if I 
try to ask the same question again, the confidence of the top 50 docs change. How can they train the Rerank model with s
uch small and hallucinated data and expect the model to work properly and adapt to the new domain?

* **My question:**


Are their expectation correct? Maybe I'm just being stupid.

1. How do you explain this to the customer and your colleag
ues?
2. Do you have a similar issue? What is your approach in this situation and how did you test the quality of the rer
ank model without ground truth? Maybe some suggestion is also welcomed.

\~Thanks a lot!

Hi everyone,

I’m working on a RAG project where I need to retrieve and embed both Markdown tables and free text from Qd

I need an effective way to retrieve tables stored in Qdrant or any other technologies when need

I’m currently using LangChain
 for data processing. Any guidance on integrating Qdrant and LangChain to achieve this, or alternative approaches and to
ols that might simplify the process, would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your help!

```
Hey, i hope this is the right sub.

  
A customer asked me to develop an ai tool that takes advertising brochures, scans
 through them and extracts information about the products and then parses them into structured data. At first i thought 
about classic OCR but in my first testings the results weren't that good, probably because of the rather complex layouts
 in those kind of documents (i've attached an example). I did some research on ai ocr but i am not really sure what to u
se or if this is even the right approach. Maybe ocr models arent even the best approach, maybe there are  image analysis
 models that are better suited for this?  
My idea is to use an ai model to extract the data and then chain it with anot
her llm that outputs the data in a structured way.   


Do you guys have any ideas how to approach this? Any help is ver
y welcomed!

Good afternoon. 
I am studying about implementing a chatbot that follows a conversational flow. I am from Brazil and I d
o not know if this is the correct translation. 
But I need the chatbot to answer customer questions and also ask questio
ns about topic X, then Z, then Z for example, guiding the customer in the conversation. 

Any light on what to research 
to implement something along these lines? I appreciate it.

Hello everyone and thank you for letting me post this.

We have recently released a new book that I would love to share 
with the community: AI Apps with LangChain, by Roberto Infante.  
  
📚 Our latest MEAP (Manning Early Access Program) re
lease includes clear diagrams and numerous code samples to guide you in building useful LangChain-based AI apps. The boo
k will help you develop effective LLM-powered projects, such as a simple document summarization tool, a reliable web-bas
ed research assistant, a semantic search chatbot, and advanced RAG.

About t
he book (from the website):  
***AI Apps with LangChain*** demystifies the most complex techniques of building LLM-based
 applications, including deploying open-source LLMs locally and fine-tuning them for specific applications. You’ll start
 from the ground up: LLM architecture, how to adapt them to your needs, and the advanced prompt engineering techniques y
ou’ll need to succeed. From there, you’ll quickly move on to developing effective LLM-powered projects—from a simple too
l to summarize documents, to a research assistant that can reliably use the web, a semantic search chatbot, and implemen
ting advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation.

About the author:  
**Roberto Infante** has been developing software prof
essionally for over 25 years, primarily for financial institutions including investment banks, asset managers, brokers, 
and exchanges. He currently leads quantitative development for the treasury department of a hedge fund.

all -  [ We responded to all your feedbacks on my earlier Langchain project sharing on r/Langchain!! — JENOVA ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1f2hfl5/we_responded_to_all_your_feedbacks_on_my_earlier/) , 2024-08-29-0912
```
Hey r/Langchain, a few weeks ago I shared my Langchain project [JENOVA](https://www.jenova.ai/) in this [post](https://w
ww.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1ellpk9/sharing_my_project_that_was_built_on_langchain_an/), which received 12k views
 and 90% upvote rate. To quickly describe what JENOVA does, it's an all-in-one AI assistant that intelligently routes yo
ur queries to the foundation model (e.g. GPT, Claude, Gemini) that can provide the answer and is complemented with tools
 such as web browsing and document upload.

 In that post many of you gave some extremely useful feedback and suggestion
s for the project, and just this weekend we rolled out some major improvements in response your feedback:

* **By far th
e #1 biggest feedback from users is to show what models JENOVA used to generate each response.** We delivered by display
ing the model underneath each JENOVA response appears when you hover over the message on desktop/tap the message on mobi
le. This way JENOVA can maintain its design philosophy of simplicity/cleanness while also providing the requested techni
cal information.

https://preview.redd.it/zatk6ydjn7ld1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3f43ce156972fe84712e1ff97
413e166a8e25b2

* **Whenever JENOVA references the information from the internet, it will now always cite the source and
 include the hyperlink.**

https://preview.redd.it/8tgkq8vln7ld1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=31e363d6154b495db
d99d531a575aaacac59d2f0

* On the mobile web version of JENOVA, whenever you hit enter in the input box, it will create 
a new line rather than send message (one of the best quality of life improvements for mobile AI experience).
* We reduce
d the likelihood that JENOVA performs unnecessary web search.
* You can now enter message in the input box and attached 
files while JENOVA is still processing its response.
* Added detection mechanism where if one provider's LLM goes down (
e.g. Claude API went down last week), we can quickly switch to another provider's LLM to ensure service continuation.
* 
We fixed the issue where every time new code was deployed, users are automatically signed out.
* Added sample prompts on
 the new chat page.
* Another big feedback was to add login options other than Google SSO (mainly regular email sign in)
, we haven't had the capacity to implement this yet but it is on our soon-to-do list.

Over the past week there had been
 long periods where the response speed of JENOVA was very slow. This slowness was caused by instability of Claude API. W
e're monitoring this situation closely and it seems that in the past 24 hour Claude API has been relatively stable and f
ast.

Thanks for your support and we welcome any other feedbacks and suggestions! Also please join our growing Reddit co
mmunity at !!

all -  [ Best framework for RAG? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rag/comments/1f2gy6z/best_framework_for_rag/) , 2024-08-29-0912
```
I am planning to build a RAG web app, but I am confused about which one should I go for. For my web app I will be workin
g on JavaScript mainly, so should I build my own RAG system in javascript or use third party library like lanchchain or 
llamaindex using python?

Many people here on Reddit suggest avoiding wrappers like langchain and use your own RAG syste
m, if so, then should I build my own text splitter, loaders, retrievers and other parts of RAG or use some parts from la
ngchain and build some myself?

How do you guys build your RAG apps, especially that can scale well? What database do yo
u use? I am use postgresql with pgvector.

all -  [ What methods do I have for 'improving' the output of an LLM that returns a structured JSON? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1f2aus3/what_methods_do_i_have_for_improving_the_output/) , 2024-08-29-0912
```
I am making a website where the UI is populated by text generated by an LLM through structured JSON, where each attribut
e given is a specific text field in the UI. The LLM returns structured JSON given a theme, and so far I have used OpenAI
's API. However, the LLM usually returns quite generic and unsatisfactory output. 

I have a few examples (around 15) of
 theme-expected JSON output pairings. How should I incorporate these examples into the LLM? The first thought I had woul
d be to include these examples in the pre-prompt, but I feel like so many tokens would downgrade the performance a bit. 
The other idea would be to fine-tune the LLM using these examples, but I don't know if 15 is enough examples to make a d
ifference. Can LangChain help in any way? I thought also of using the LangChain context, where the examples are sent int
o an embedding space and the most appropriate one is retrieved after a query to feed into the LLM pre-prompt, but even i
n this case I don't know how much better the output would be.

Just to clarify, it's of course difficult to say that the
 LLM output is 'bad' or 'generic' but what I mean is that it is quite far from what I would expect it to return.

all -  [ How to debug prompts? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LlamaIndex/comments/1f2apo9/how_to_debug_prompts/) , 2024-08-29-0912
```
Hello! I am using langchain and the OpenAI API (sometimes with gpt4-o, sometimes with local LLMs exposing this API via O
llama), and I am a bit concerned with the different chat formats that different LLMs are fine tuned with. I am thinking 
about special tokens like `<|start\_header\_id|>` and things like that. Not all LLMs are created equal. So I would like 
to have the option (with langchain and openai API) to visualize the full prompt that the LLM is receiving. The problem w
ith having so many abstraction layers is that this is not easy to achieve, and I am struggling with it. I would like to 
know if anyone has a nice way of dealing with this problem. There is a solution that should work, but I hope I don't nee
d to go that far, which is creating a proxy server that listens to the requests, logs them and redirects them as they go
 to the real openai API endpoint. 

Thanks in advance!

MachineLearning -  [ [P] using GPT4o with langchain/chroma for sports analysis  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1enuzlp/p_using_gpt4o_with_langchainchroma_for_sports/) , 2024-08-29-0912
```
Hi all, I'm working on a side project that helps with sports analysis for historical games, which in turn will help with
 sports betting. Currently I've been only focused on MLB because I wanted to see how the use case would pan out.

My fir
st attempt at this was to use the openai endpoint and load all the relevant JSON objects and send a prompt along with th
em to GPT and see what I get back. Eventually, the context size was getting way too big and the problem I was running in
to was that it was expensive. Although, the prompts back were actually pretty decent and relevant to the data.

My secon
d attempt was to setup a RAG using Chroma/LangChain/GPT4o. I got it to work but the answers all seem very off and super 
vague. None of the data I have was shown in any of the prompts i asked, or any of the players that were playing in a gam
e were mentioned at all in the prompt back, plus it kept mentioning wrong games/teams whe asking it specific games. I’m 
assuming I might need to adjust the vector store a bit but not sure how I can do that with chroma.

My question is what 
might be the best way to setup some sort of process? My end result, I would like a response back using the historical da
ta I've provided to make assumptions on what a game could be like based off all the stats given, with some room for GPT 
to also make some inference as well.

I am a super new at this so it's been a learning process so far; please bear with 
me.

Hey everyone! Just came across a new feature of Beyond LLM that can evaluate Langchain RAG pipelines! It provides contex
t relevancy, answer relevancy, and groundedness. Check out the code snippet I’m sharing—perfect for testing your RAG pip
elines! For more info, be sure to check it out on GitHub [here](https://github.com/aiplanethub/beyondllm/blob/main/cookb

deeplearning -  [ Creating a project on NLP ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1ey2e85/creating_a_project_on_nlp/) , 2024-08-29-0912
```
So me and my friend completed the ML and DL specialization by AndrewNg, and were just gonna get started on a project. We
 decided to make a academic assistant. So basically what this does is a user can upload a PDF,text file or any other sup
ported media and the can ask questions related to it's contents. The main objective being making learning quick given la
rger documents.

The pipeline we decided is pretty standard for such a project.

1. Split the text into chunks
2. Genera
te embeddings of the chunks
3. Store the chunks in a vector DB
4. Find the top K similar chunks to the query 
5. Retriev
e context and feed it into a LLM for an answer.

So I looked up for a library and framework to use and decided on langch
ain. We haven't decided on an LLM yet but want to run it locally so no OpenAI please. 

Since this is gonna be out first
 AI project confidence is low. I would really appreciate any heads up on the issues we may face, any suggestions on libr
aries,frameworks or models will be really helpful as well. 

Appreciate any resourceful comment 😊

deeplearning -  [ How To Build Your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Using Open-source Tools: LangChain, LLAMA 3,  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1emdotx/how_to_build_your_retrieval_augmented_generation/) , 2024-08-29-0912
```


TL;DR: RAG overcomes the limitations of LLMs by bringing in external sources of information as relevant context.  
  

At the end of the step-by-step tutorial, you will be able to give your favorite LLM (ChatGPT, LLAMA 3, Mixtral, Gemini, 
Claude, etc.) some documents, ask it a question and see it respond based on relevant context.  
  
This will be running 
locally, using open-source libraries. Zero API and tooling costs.

***TL;DR*** What is the best way to convert user input into sequence of commands and their corresponding parameters? Lik
e, imagine you are not a programmer and there is a console app with a CLI, but, well, you don't know the structure and t
he syntax of commands. And you don't want to know. YBut! You have a locally running instance of llama3.1 -- or whatever 
open LLM is out there now -- and you can ask it to create a CLI command for you. What would you do to accomplish that?


**Intro**

A little bit of context. I'm working on a project that targets scientists as end users. It has some UI using 
which it's possible to do all sort of things the lab workers would like to do. But recently the projects product owner d
ecided that it would be cool to have a small chat window that is accessable basically everywhere throughout the applicat
ion UI in which 'lives' a bot that can accept some input from a user and do what is requested. The pool of commands is f
inite and predefined.

**The issue**

So, putting details aside, the main issue to be solved is parsing user input (unst
ructured and possible incomplete data) to some structured form. In general, each and every user input should be transfor
med into a data structure that represents a sequence of commands with their parameters, for example:

User input: Please
, create X with param1 set to value1 and param2 equal to value2

Desired output:

    create_x --param1 value1 --param2 
value2

In this example, there is only one command, but in real life the request can represent a sequence of N commands,
 and they may depend on each other (sequence of execution does matter)

**What I've tried so far**

I have an 'experimen
t' environment: a python project with `ollama` and `langchain` installed. The main model I test is llama3.1-instruct wit
h 5bit quantization. (I'm sort of limited with hardware resourses, so XXB parameter models do not fit).

Up until now, I
've tried to achieve what I want with prompting in different forms, but in general I do the following:

1. As the very f
irst message in the chat, I create a 'system' one which explain what commands are there. The format is the following (I 
replaced original data not to expose the context more, so it's very generic): 

```xml
<scope>
    <models>
        <mod
el name='entityA'>
            <field name='uniqueId' type='string' description='unique identifier for entityA'/>
      
      <field name='label' type='string' description='label for entityA'/>
            <field name='category' type='enum'
 possible-value='alpha, beta, gamma, delta'/>
        </model>
        <model name='entityB'>
            <field name='u
niqueId' description='unique identifier for entityB'/>
            <field name='entityAIds' type='array' description='id
entifiers of entityAs associated with this entityB'/>
        </model>
    </models>
    <commands>
        <command nam
e='create_entityA' description='creates an instance of entityA'>
            <param name='uniqueId' type='string' descri
ption='unique identifier for entityA'/>
            <param name='label' type='string' description='label for entityA' re
quired='true'/>
            <param name='category' type='enum' possible-values='alpha, beta, gamma, delta'
             
      description='category of entityA (one value from the possible values list)' required='true'/>
        </command>
 
       <command name='remove_entityA' description='removes an instance of entityA by its unique identifier'>
           
 <param name='uniqueId' description='unique identifier of the entityA to be removed'
                   required='true'/
>
        </command>
        <command name='create_entityB'>
            <param name='label' description='label for enti
tyB'/>
        </command>
        <command name='link_entityAs_to_entityB'
                 description='associates inst
ances of entityA with a specific entityB based on the provided unique identifier of entityB'>
            <param name='u
niqueId' description='unique identifier of the entityB to which entityAs should be associated'
                   requir
ed='true'/>
            <param name='entityAIds'
                   description='an array of unique identifiers of entit
yAs to associate with the entityB'
                   type='array'
                   required='true'/>
        </comman
d>
        <command name='navigate' description='indicates that a user wants to go to a specific section of the platform
'>
            <param name='section' possible-values='entitiesA, entitiesB, configuration' required='true'/>
        </c
ommand>
        <command name='support' description='should be executed when a user seeks assistance on available functi
ons'/>
    </commands>
</scope>
```

So, now the model is provided with some context. Then, also in the 'system' message
 I:

* 'tell' the model that user input should be converted into a sequence of commands along with the corresponding par
ameters, all of this is described in the XML above
* describe the desired output format
* try to enforce some restrictio
n and cover edge cases

**The question part**

*Is this approach* ***viable***\*?\*

If yes, maybe there are some ***way
s to improve it***?

If not, *what would be* ***the alternative***?

So far I don't see how to apply fine tuning here

T
hank you in advance!
