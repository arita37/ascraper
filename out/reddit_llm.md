I'm working through the 'Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) App: Part 2' tutorial where you bind the retrieve 
function as a tool, and then add a conditional edge for when it is executed.

I've been digging through the documentatio
n, but I cannot seem to find an answer for the actual message sent to the LLM to instruct it to either use the retrieve 
tool or respond (as an example: 'If needed, use the retrieve tool to retrieve information related to a query. Otherwise 
respond directly').

This tutorial also had the LLM rephrase the user queries when calling the retrieve tool.

Although 
it doesn't stop me from proceeding, I would really like a look behind the hood as to what LangChain is sending when tool
s are binded to a ChatModel.

  
EDIT: Thank you for your help. I was unable to see this information because it is passe
d as a separate argument in the API (which is exactly the understanding I was trying to obtain).

```
Let me ask you an absolute beginner doubt. I have created a simple react agentic architecture using langraph. I have use
d 'MessagesState' as State and passed it to the graph while compiling it.
But for multiple sequential invocations, it se
ems like the state is refreshed. 

For example if I invoke the graph with 
'hi, from now on your name is 'Groot'', 

The
 response will be like 
'Hi, I'm Groot, how can I help you?' 

But for the next execution if I ask the name, it's helple
ss about it.

Is there any other way than using checkpointers to tackle this task?

Hi guys,I need some help working with LangChain and LangGraph.

I have an agent, a supervisor, and a tool associated wit

I'm a current Computer Engineering Master's student focusing on AI/Machine Learning, and I've been applying to internshi

 get companies lower on the totem pole than Salesforce to give me an interview or OA.

I'm wondering if my resume format
 is bad and getting auto rejected or if I just don't have enough experience to make it in a competitive market (It could
 be a combination of both). I get the sense that my resume isn't even making it past recruiters. I see other people at l
east get interviews with these places, I'm wondering what they're doing that I'm not.

Any advice or tips would be great
ly appreciated. I haven't had much luck getting advice in other subs or having my resume refined by someone on Fiver for
 $60. For reference I am a US citizen (I know that can affect what recruiters do with applications).

all -  [ [Student] Looking for feedback on my resume and general advise regarding job search ](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/comments/1hoa3j9/student_looking_for_feedback_on_my_resume_and/) , 2024-12-31-0913
```
My last post didn't get much traction so I hope this one does better. I believe this is my first time posting here, but 
I have posted on the resumes subreddit before. Looking for criticism/feedback on the latest iteration of my resume. 

I 
am looking for robotics/EE roles, and have been applying since the start of the fall semester, but no luck regarding get
ting interviews. No luck with internships either. A couple of pre-recorded video interviews but they didn't go anywhere.
 I am not sure what I am doing wrong, is it the fact that I am an international student, lack of experience, my resume, 
or all three.

I would also like advice on what roles in EE/robotics would best fit me, given my skills. I figure being 
specific will not get me anywhere hence the desperation.

Thanks again for your time.

Has anyone thought about adding a vertex DB to the voice pipeline rather than adding all entities exported in the prompt
 every time? Maybe we could have a plug-in that allows calling a langchain pipeline rather than an LLM directly, this wo
uld allow querying entities rather than having them in the prompt and could open up to a more complex multi agent setup

all -  [ Guide to Integrating LangChain with Ollama for Local AI Workflows ](https://www.reddit.com/r/u_KonradFreeman/comments/1hntzfb/guide_to_integrating_langchain_with_ollama_for/) , 2024-12-31-0913
```
For those seeking to transition from cloud-based AI services to a more private and cost-effective local setup, I have re
cently published a comprehensive guide on integrating LangChain with Ollama. This guide outlines how to build robust wor
kflows powered by locally hosted language models (LLMs). You can access the complete write-up here: [LangChain + Ollama 
Guide](https://danielkliewer.com/2024/12/27/langchain-ollama).

This resource serves as a valuable starting point for ex
ploring local AI workflows or considering alternatives to cloud-based solutions. I am happy to answer any questions or d
iscuss potential use cases in more detail.

To provide a preview, the final program created as part of the guide is incl
uded below. While I used the QwQ model in this implementation, the setup is flexible‚Äîyou can easily swap in a different 
model by modifying the corresponding payload entry.

The project was designed with two main objectives:

1. Core Concept
 Mastery: To understand the fundamental principles behind building scalable AI workflows.
2. Enhanced Local Model Capabi
lities: To explore methods of improving locally hosted models, enabling them to match or surpass some of the functionali
ty of cloud-based alternatives.

Currently, the application leverages simple folders containing .json persona files. Fut
ure iterations could integrate a database for greater flexibility. Additionally, a React-based UI for persona customizat
ion could be implemented, similar to the functionality I developed in my Personagen project.

# Key Innovations

* Graph
-Based Logic and Reasoning: By simulating logic with graph structures, the workflow can enhance local model outputs. Thi
s involves using multiple LLM calls with a context tracker, implemented through a graph-based LLM-to-LLM structure. This
 reduces hallucinations and enables more advanced functionalities.
* Scalable Personas: The personas folder allows for s
eamless customization, enabling developers to define any desired attributes. These can range from predefined JSON struct
ures to dynamic outputs generated by LLM calls, facilitating more complex orchestration of nodes and subnodes.
* Optimiz
ed Workflow Execution: By utilizing LangChain asynchronously with topological sorting, the application chains prompts ef
ficiently, minimizing response times.

I know what agents are and how could they be useful in general. But why the hype around them right now? 
We already hav

Why are all the big companies starting to talk about the agents right now?

Hello everyone,

I'm currently developing a PDF RAG app .

App's workflow is like : uploading a pdf , parsing it ( using
 pymupdf4llm ) , chunking it ( using Semantic Chunker ) , creating embeddings ( text-embedding-3-large ) , storing embed
dings to the Pinecone DB .

Now, along with the embeddings I store the original parsed markdown text to the PineconeDB .


This worked OK so far .

I want to develop this app into a multi modal RAG app . So I started researching how to build
 one .

I came across Alejandro's latest video (¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrReyH5cu0](https://www.youtube.com/w
atch?v=uLrReyH5cu0)¬†) .

Here, what he's doing is storing the original chunk in a doc store and summary of the chunk in 
the vector store.

He used Langchain's InMemoryStore as the doc store . As it is an in memory store , it isn't scalable 
, I want something that persists. Came across Langchain's LocalFileStore .

According to Langchain official docs , It wo
rks on the local file system , if I have many users , then my app server will eventually become slow .

Can it be linked
 to AWS S3 or some other storage solution ?

If yes , then how ? are there any example implementations that you guys can
 refer me to ?

If no , then how do I build one ?

I want to build the doc store user specific .

User A has UserA\_DocS
tore  
User B has UserB\_DocStore

using pymupdf4llm ) , chunking it ( using Semantic Chunker ) , creating embeddings ( text-embedding-3-large ) , storing 
embeddings to the Pinecone DB .

Now, along with the embeddings I store the original parsed markdown text to the Pinecon
eDB .

This worked OK so far .   
  
I want to develop this app into a multi modal RAG app . So I started researching ho
w to build one .

I came across Alejandro's latest video ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrReyH5cu0](https://www.you
tube.com/watch?v=uLrReyH5cu0) ) .

Here, what he's doing is storing the original chunk in a doc store and summary of the
 chunk in the vector store.   
  
He used Langchain's InMemoryStore as the doc store . As it is an in memory store , it 
isn't scalable , I want something that persists. Came across Langchain's LocalFileStore .   
  
According to Langchain o
fficial docs , It works on the local file system , if I have many users , then my app server will eventually become slow
 .   
  
Can it be linked to AWS S3 or some other storage solution ?  
  
If yes , then how ? are there any example impl
ementations that you guys can refer me to ?

If no , then how do I build one ?

I want to build the doc store user speci
fic . 

User A has UserA\_DocStore  
User B has UserB\_DocStore

```
I am an international Master's student based in Cincinnati, looking for Robotics or Electrical engineering roles I am wo
rking on my thesis, and hope to graduate in the summer if all goes well. By going well I mean I land a job by then. I ha
ve been applying since the fall, and have had no real luck except for a couple of pre-recorded video interviews that did
 not go anywhere. Tried applying for internships but that was a dead end as well.

I have posted here before as well, an
d have to my knowledge incorporated all suggestions. At this point I am unsure what I am doing wrong. Is it my resume, l
ack of experience, the fact that I am an international student, or all three combined. I have been working on upskilling
 myself by brushing up on AutoOCAD, AutoCAD Electrical and Fusion. Is there anything else I can do to improve my resume?


I'd also appreciate any advice on what roles I should apply for, given my experience and skill set. I am open to gener
ic EE roles as well. Or is that an approach I should take? How do I narrow down?

Any suggestions or advice would be gre
atly appreciated.

all -  [ Langsmith Not Showing All Tokens ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1hn4e54/langsmith_not_showing_all_tokens/) , 2024-12-31-0913
```
I'm new to langchain, and I was trying out langsmith. I tried to compare token usage from langchain to the OpenAI playgr
ound for assistants. The assistant I made has a system prompt and some functions.

I made a langchain/langgraph react ag
ent with the same setup.

I prompted the model to where it would trigger one of my function calls.


---

The total toke
ns via OpenAI playground were 1713 (1608 input, 105 output).

On langsmith, it shows 267 tokens (234 input/prompt, 33 ou
tput/completion).

The difference is drastic.

If I put the final AI response from the langsmith trace into OpenAI's tok
enizer, I get 33 tokens. 

If I go to the OpenAI Chat completions playground and put the system prompt and then my user 
message, no function calling or any additional padding, I get a total of 115 input tokens. In langsmith, it also shows 1
15 input tokens.

I believe the 119 remaining input tokens are likely the function call result being passed to the model
.

It seems that langsmith is not counting tokens beyond what is passed into the message history when invoking the agent
, as well as the tool result. It doesn't include the tokens from tool definitions, and I guess anything else that langch
ain/graph add into the input prompts. This means that as far as I can tell, there is no clear way to see the actual/real
 token consumption through langsmith.

Why is that? Is there a way to configure langsmith to include all tokens?

## Edi
t:

I think I figured it out! You need to enable `stream_usage` in your model, otherwise I guess langsmith doesn't recei
ve correct usage metrics? After enabling this, langsmith now shows the correct token usage.

In my case, it's `ChatOpenA
I(model='gpt-4o-mini', stream_usage=True)`

```
I‚Äôve recently gotten into AI agents, but I‚Äôm not sure where to start.

Some people say that frameworks like LangChain an
d LlamaIndex have too many abstractions and not great for production environments. I came across Pydantic AI, and it loo
ks interesting, but it‚Äôs new, so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs any good.

Others say frameworks are a waste of time and that the 
best way is to build everything from scratch.

What do you guys think I should do, and how can I learn this stuff?

Hi everyone, I'm new to Langchain and this is my first post here. I'm looking to write a script that compares informatio

ct packaging, and the data is unstructured. I want to identify discrepancies between the two, including typos, differenc
es in values, upper/lower case differences, and spaces, and return coordinates of rectangles where are those erroros

Ca
n anyone recommend an approach for this task and share some tips and tricks? I'm just starting out with Langchain and wo
uld appreciate any guidance.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Greetings, I hope this space can help bring attention to an important issue. I kindly ask for your support in sharing th
is news: Francisco Angulo de Lafuente, known on Twitter as @**Francisco\_Ecofa**, won a hackathon organized by NVIDIA wi
th an incredibly complex project named **NEBULA**.

This project introduces an innovative way to optimize neural network
s using light reflections and basic principles of quantum computing instead weigths. However, despite his outstanding ac
hievement, Francisco was stripped of the prize without clear or detailed explanations.

It‚Äôs crucial that this situation
 is clarified and that NVIDIA acts transparently. I would greatly appreciate your help in spreading this news to ensure 
fairness.

Thank you for your support. üôè
