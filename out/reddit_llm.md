```
I'm curious about how I might go about creating the chatgpt experience, which combines chat and the ability to write and
 execute python code. 

I know I could do this with yne Assistants API. And I know I could do this with Langchain. 

How
 could I do it with vanilla agents? Like if I used Open Interpreter as the code part, I don't know how to combine it wit
h chat abilities so that the agent 'knows' to chat if it needs to chat and to use code if it needs to code (e.g. Create 
a chart from data). 

Could a vanilla agent setup be used in such a way as a backend for a chat application?

Hi,

I am using the mixtral 8x7b instruct model where function calling generally is not possible as of my knowledge. But
 I built a Langgraph pipeline where I am using the Mixtral 8x7b model and for classifying a user question the model shou
ld return boolean values (True or False).

  
Is Mixtral capable of this? When I tested it out, it sometimes worked but 
often times it did not. I am using the model with the Groq Api and it could well be that the error is on the api

My company has a large library of 200ish page documents that we frequently create for project proposals. Creating these 
documents is very laborious and so is searching for information in them. I was advised to turn those documents into vect
or embeddings, load those embeddings into embeddings index or db, then do Retrieval Augmented Generation over those docu
ments using langchain.

I am curious if this process is possible to do entirely locally because of the sensitive nature 
of the documents and if so what tools to use? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Hello everyone,

I'm currently working on a project to develop a customer support live agent that not only assists in re
solving issues but also understands the tone of the conversation and guides the agent to ensure successful call closures
. I'm seeking advice and suggestions from those who have experience or expertise in this area.

**Project Overview:**

T
he goal is to create a live support agent that can:

1. **Understand the Tone of the Conversation:** Analyze the emotion
al tone (e.g., frustration, satisfaction, confusion) of customer interactions in real-time.
2. **Guide Agent Responses:*
* Provide suggestions to human agents on how to respond effectively based on the detected tone and context.
3. **Ensure 
Successful Call Closures:** Help agents navigate conversations towards a satisfactory resolution for the customer.

**Ke
y Features I'm Aiming For:**

* **Tone Detection:** Implement natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze an
d understand the customer's emotional state.
* **Response Recommendations:** Develop an AI-driven system that offers res
ponse suggestions tailored to the detected tone and context of the conversation.
* **Real-Time Feedback:** Provide live 
feedback to agents during the call to adjust their approach if necessary.
* **Learning and Improvement:** Incorporate ma
chine learning to continuously improve the accuracy of tone detection and response suggestions based on historical data.

all -  [ Extract Data From Chat History: Quickly and Accurately ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1dpt9iz/extract_data_from_chat_history_quickly_and/) , 2024-06-29-0910
```
Hi all - several recent posts here have discussed the challenges of extracting structured data from chat histories. This
 is a common challenge: fulfilling sales orders, collecting support info, booking meetings/appointments, and more.

Zep’
s new [Structured Data Extraction](https://blog.getzep.com/structured-data-extraction/) is a high-accuracy tool for extr
acting data from chat histories. It's also 10x faster than gpt-4o.

https://i.redd.it/nwrcdkgwo49d1.gif

# Versus OpenAI
 JSON Mode

OpenAI (or other LLM provider) JSON Mode (with something like a LangChain's `with_structured_output`), only 
guarantees that the result will be well-formed JSON, but the LLM may still return hallucinated values, incorrectly struc
tured fields (think a phone number or date in an incorrect format), or even fields that don't exist in your `pydantic` m
odel!

It can also be super slow, and the more fields you add to your `pydantic` model, the longer it takes.

To ensure 
fast, accurate results, Zep uses a combination of:

* dialog preprocessing, which, amongst other things, improves accura
cy for machine-transcribed dialogs and allows partial dates to be extracted;
* guided output inference techniques on fin
e-tuned LLMs running on our own infrastructure;
* and post-inference validation.

# Using Zep with LangChain

It's simpl
e to [drop Zep into a LangChain application](https://help.getzep.com/langchain/overview). Once you're persisting memory 
to Zep, you can extract data from this dialogue.

# Low or zero marginal latency cost to adding additional fields

Zep's
 extraction latency scales sub-linearly with the number of fields in your model. That is, you may add additional fields 
with a low or no marginal increase in latency.

# Support for Partial and Relative Dates

Zep understands various date a
nd time formats, including relative times such as “yesterday” or “last week.” It can also parse partial dates and times,
 such as “at 3pm” or “on the 15th.”

# Extracting from Speech Transcripts

Zep can understand and extract data from mach
ine-transcribed transcripts. Spelled out numbers and dates will be parsed as if written language. Utterances such as “uh
” or “um” are ignored.

You can read more [in our announcement](https://blog.getzep.com/structured-data-extraction/) and
 the [Structured Data Extraction guide](https://help.getzep.com/langchain/overview).

This was a ton of work to build an
d lots of fun. Would love your feedback if you give it a spin!

```
Hi!

I just finished first year of college and I want to start preparing for the upcoming wars and battles for internshi
ps. (particularly interested in AI/ML - ofc, everyone is these days TwT)

I’m looking for some constructive criticism an
d advice on my resume. Firstly, I decided to stick to a one page resume because I am just a sophomore (and this communit
y would die on a hill for that + I trust your experience). So, my internships have taken most of the space and I know so
me of them were for a short duration so I have come here to seek your advice - whether i should keep them or not)

My co
ncerns:

1) Work experience vs. Projects: Which is more important and in what circumstances?
I have a few personal proje
cts and I plan to work on more (to deviate from the typical projects everybody has on their resume), HOWEVER, I am not s
ure where to place them. I was thinking that 
- Maybe I can get rid of my second internship
- Maybe I can get rid of bot
h my hs internships
- Maybe I can shorten the bullet points
- Is there even a teeny tiny chance you guys would advise me
 to add another page

2) Multiple Resumes: Do people generally have different versions of their resumes?

I know its adv
ised to tweak your resume for each job application and include the keywords but what I mean is like having one version t
hat focuses more on work experience and another that emphasizes projects? How do you balance these sections and how do y
ou choose which to apply with?

3) Additional activities: There’s some other stuff like hackathons, club committees (for
 instance, something relevant like (GenAI club). Should I make space for these too?

Please feel free to share any other
 feedback or suggestions you have!!

all -  [ Sharing history between independent agents ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1dpqtfw/sharing_history_between_independent_agents/) , 2024-06-29-0910
```
Hello. I'm new to LangChain and I've been wondering how to achieve shared memory/session between independent agents, wit
hout using a graph with a supervisor. I have an agent which is responsible for breaking down complex question to steps t
hat can be executed by other agents. It is aware other agents exist.

For example:

Main question: What will be the weat
her tomorrow in Oslo? Will it be warmer than in Bergen?

Which is broken down to steps by an agent:

1. {'agent': 'DateT
imeAgent, 'task': 'Get tomorrow's date'}
2. {'agent': 'ForecastAgent, 'task': 'Get the weather in Oslo, Norway for 2024/
06/28'}
3. {'agent': 'ForecastAgent, 'task': 'Get the weather in Bergen, Norway for 2024/06/28'}
4. {'agent': 'CalcAgent
, 'task': 'Calculate the difference between the temperatures'}

As you can see, step 4 is related to the outcome of the 
previous ones. What's the best way to make the agents aware of the results of their peers? Is the only way to use langgr
aph? It seems a bit inefficient to me to have a wrapper agent using the RunnableWithMessageHistory class and have an LLM
 manage the routing and conversation.

Thank you for your assistance beforehand!

```
I am currently working on integrating several components into a comprehensive chat application using LangServe and LangC
hain. Below, I detail the components involved and the specific issues I'm encountering. Any guidance or suggestions woul
d be greatly appreciated.

# Components and Setup:

1. **History Aware Retriever and Question Answer Chain**:
   * I've 
created a chain that consists of a history-aware retriever and a question-answer chain.

&#8203;

    contextualize_q_sy
stem_prompt = '''Given a chat history and the latest user question \
    which might reference context in the chat histo
ry, formulate a standalone question \
    which can be understood without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, 
\
    just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is.'''
    contextualize_q_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fr
om_messages(
        [
            ('system', contextualize_q_system_prompt),
            MessagesPlaceholder('chat_hist
ory'),
            ('human', '{input}'),
        ]
    )
    history_aware_retriever = create_history_aware_retriever(
 
       llm, retriever, contextualize_q_prompt
    )
    
    
    ### Answer question ###
    qa_system_prompt = '''You 
are an assistant for question-answering tasks. \
    Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the questio
n. \
    If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. \
    Use three sentences maximum and keep the answ
er concise.\
    
    {context}'''
    qa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
        [
            ('system', qa
_system_prompt),
            MessagesPlaceholder('chat_history'),
            ('human', '{input}'),
        ]
    )
    
question_answer_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, qa_prompt)
    
    rag_chain = create_retrieval_chain(history
_aware_retriever, question_answer_chain)

1. **Message History Implementation**:
   * The application incorporates `Redi
sChatMessageHistory` along with `RunnableWithMessageHistory`. The intention is to leverage Redis for managing chat messa
ge history, tracking conversations by User ID and Conversation ID.
2. **LangGraph Integration**:
   * I'm attempting to 
integrate this setup into LangGraph. However, I'm facing challenges because LangGraph documentation suggests using Check
points with SQLite, and it's unclear how to integrate RedisChatMessageHistory which is essential for my application.

# 
Issues:

* **Integration with LangGraph**: How can I integrate `RedisChatMessageHistory` within LangGraph, given that La
ngGraph primarily supports SQLite for Checkpoints?
* **Consistent Message History**: I need to ensure that message histo
ry capabilities are maintained across the entire application, allowing tracking of conversations by User ID and Conversa
tion ID.

# Resources:

* For the retrieval chain setup, please refer to the LangChain documentation on question answeri
ng with chat history: [LangChain QA with Chat History](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/use_cases/question_answeri
ng/chat_history/#tying-it-together).
* For details on managing persistent chat with user IDs and conversation IDs, see t
his example from LangServe: [LangServe Chat with Persistence](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langserve/blob/main/exampl
es/chat_with_persistence_and_user/server.py).

# Request:

I am seeking advice or examples on how to properly integrate 
RedisChatMessageHistory with LangGraph in a manner that maintains full functionality of the message history features. An
y insights or pointers towards documentation or similar implementations would be incredibly helpful.

he utiliy function provided by langchain: 'create\_retriever\_tool':

    tool: Tool = create_retriever_tool(documents.a
s_retriever(search_kwargs={
        'k': 6}), name='search_documents', description='Search documents')
    
    tool.inv
oke('foo')

The response:

'foo'

So in this case, the metadata part is completely missing. I understand that I could us
e a prompt\_template which includes the metadata:

    document_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(
        'Document
 chunk metadata: tenant_id: {tenant_id}...\n'
        'Document chunk content: {page_content}. '
    )
    tool: Tool = 
create_retriever_tool(documents.as_retriever(search_kwargs={
        'k': 6}), name='search_documents', description='Sea
rch documents', document_prompt=document_prompt)

and this works but the output from directly calling retriever.get\_rel
evant\_documents('foo') is a document array which makes it easier to work with.

I would like to have the exact same out
put from the response of calling the tool. How can this be achieved? Is the only solution to create a custom tool functi
on instead of using the utility function?

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Seeking Feedback on My GenAI Job Fit Project - New to LangChain/LangGraph ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1dgns9p/p_seeking_feedback_on_my_genai_job_fit_project/) , 2024-06-29-0910

Hi all,

Soo, i have been working on a a projectcalled [GenAI Job Fit](https://github.com/DAVEinside/GenAI_Job_Fit). It'
s an AI-driven system designed to enhance job applications by providing tailored recommendations based on individual pro
files.

I'm relatively new to LangChain and LangGraph, and I've incorporated them into this project. I would greatly app
reciate it if you could check out the repository and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Your insights
 on how I can better implement LangChain/LangGraph, or any other aspect of the project, would be incredibly valuable. I'
m eager to learn and make this project as robust as possible.

Thank you in advance for your time and feedback!

MachineLearning -  [ [P] I'm tired of LangChain, so I made a simple open-source alternative with support for tool using a ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1deffo8/p_im_tired_of_langchain_so_i_made_a_simple/) , 2024-06-29-0910
```
[https://github.com/piEsposito/tiny-ai-client](https://github.com/piEsposito/tiny-ai-client)

The motivation for buildin
g tiny-ai-client comes from a frustration with Langchain, that became bloated, hard to use and poorly documented - and t
akes inspiraton from [simpleaichat](https://github.com/minimaxir/simpleaichat/tree/main), but adds support to vision, to
ols and more LLM providers aside from OpenAI (Gemini, Anthropic - with Groq and Mistral on the pipeline.)

I'm building 
this to to continue what simpleaichat started and not to ride on hype, raise money or whatever, but to help people do 2 
things: build AI apps as easily as possible and switching LLMs without needing to use Langchain.

This is a minimally vi
able version of the package, with support to vision, tools and async calls. There are a lot of improvements to be done, 
but even at its current state, tiny-ai-client has generally improved my interactions with LLMs and has been used in prod
uction with success.

Let me know what you think: there are still a few bugs that may need fixing, but all the examples 
work and are easy to be be adapted to your use case.

Fast LLM RAG inference using Groq and Langchain Streaming.  
  
Groq is introducing a new, simpler processing archite
