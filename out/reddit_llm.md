Right now, I have just one chain with system prompts, and I‚Äôm trying to figure out the best way to create conversation p

I‚Äôm specifically looking for:

* Strategies for dynami

* How to structure these pathways so the bot c
an effectively respond to various customer queries (e.g., support, sales, common questions).
* Best practices for managi

We‚Äôre not looking to use V

```
How do you guys usually generate longer outputs from LLMs during the synthesis phase ? 

  
Most of the LLMs have a limi
ted output context window, typically 8k or maybe 16k. Even in that I have usually observed that they generally do not ac
hieve that length. Also, the output tokens are usually costly too.

In our RAG application, in the final synthesis phase
 where we are merging the retrieved results and sending to the LLM, we want to generate a tabular JSON output and expect
 longer output results. Right now, we are achieving this by grouping the retrieved results into different chunks, making
 LLM call on each group and then finally combining the result.

  
How is everyone else solving the use case of generati
ng longer outputs ? Let us say story writing/narration/long table generation/ etc?

the table and missing the continuing in the next page. The document is organized in chapters for each component of the c

all -  [ Semantix : Create Super functions with the help of LLMs ](https://github.com/chandralegend/semantix) , 2024-09-15-0913
```
### What Semantix Does

Current methods for extracting structured outputs from LLMs often rely on libraries such as DSPy
, OpenAI Structured Outputs, and Langchain JSON Schema. These libraries typically use Pydantic Models to create JSON sch
emas representing classes, enums, and types. However, this approach can be costly since many LLMs treat each element of 
the JSON schema (e.g., `{}`, `:`, `'$'`) as separate tokens, leading to increased costs due to the numerous tokens prese
nt in JSON schemas.

Semantix offers a different and more cost-effective solution. Instead of using JSON schemas, Semant
ix represents classes, enums, and objects in a more textual manner, reducing the number of tokens and lowering inference
 costs. Additionally, Semantix leverages Python's built-in typing system with minor modifications to provide meaning to 
parameters, function signatures, classes, enums, and functions. This approach eliminates the need for unnecessary Pydant
ic models and various classes for different prompting methods. Semantix also makes it easy for developers to create GenA
I-powered functions.

### Target Audience

Semantix is designed for developers who have worked with libraries like Langc
hain and DSPy and are tired of dealing with Pydantic models and JSON schemas. It is also ideal for those who want to add
 AI features to existing or new applications without learning extensive new libraries.

### Comparison

Semantix support
s multimodal inputs, allowing you to use images and videos effortlessly. Unlike other libraries, Semantix requires minim
al code changes to achieve excellent results.

We're looking for early users to help

I am developing a RAG based app. I want to get the sources of the retrieved context too along with the response.


    template = '''Please provide a thorough and precise response to the following question, ensuring that your 
    ¬† 
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† answer is exclusively grounded in the context provided. If the necessary information to formulate 
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†
 ¬† ¬† a complete answer is absent from the context, kindly respond with 'I am sorry, I don't know' 
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† or 'T
he document does not contain this information.'
    
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Your response should be well-structured, presented 
in a step-by-step format for maximum clarity, 
    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† and should include detailed explanations where appropriat

    '''
    
    llm = Ollama(model='gemma2:2b')

    ¬† ¬† prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)
    ¬† ¬† chain = (
    ¬†

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Review and suggest ideas for my chatbot ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fb2mwl/p_review_and_suggest_ideas_for_my_chatbot/) , 2024-09-15-0913
```
Ok, so I am currently trying to build support chatbot with following technicalities 
1. FastAPI for web server(Need to m
ake it faster)
2. Qdrant as Vector Data Base(Found it to be the fastest amongst Chromadb, Elastic Search and Milvus)
3. 
MongoDB for storing all the data and feedback.
4. Semantic chunking with max token limit of 512.
5. granite-13b-chat-v2 
as the LLM(I know it's not good but I have limited options available)
6. The data is structured as well as unstructured.
 Thinking of having involving GraphRAG with current architecture.
7. Multiple data sources stored in multiple collection
s of vector database because I have implemented an access control.
8. Using mongoengine currently as a ORM. If you know 
something better please suggest.
9. Using all-miniLM-l6-v2 as vector embedding currently but planning to use stella_en_4
00M_v5.
10. Using cosine similarity to retrieve the documents.
11. Using BLEU, F1 and BERT score for automated evaluatio
n based on golden answer.
12. Using top_k as 3.
13. Currently using basic question answering prompt but want to improve 
it. Any tips? Also heard about Automatic Prompt Evaluation.
14. Currently using custom code for everything. Looking to u
se Llamaindex or Langchain for this. 
15. Right now I am not using any AI Agent, but I want to know your opinions. 
16. 
It's a simple RAG framework and I am working on improving it.
17. I haven't included reranker but I am planning to do so
 too.

I think I mentioned pretty much everything I am using for my project. So please share your suggestions, comments 
and reviews for the same. Thank you!!

Are Agents just simple rules? Are Agents just enhanced reasoning? The answer is yes and no. Yes, in the sens
e that agents have simple rules and can sometimes enhance reasoning capabilities compared to a single prompt. But No in 
the sense that agents can have a much more diverse functionality like using specific tools, summarizing, or even followi
ng a particular style. In this blog, we look into how to set up these agents in a hierarchal manner just like running a 
small team of Authors, researchers, and supervisors.

[**How To Build Hierarchical Multi-Agent Systems?**](https://mediu
m.com/aiguys/how-to-build-hierarchical-multi-agent-systems-dc26b19201d2?sk=90958e39e1a28f5030872a90f8e3f3da)

**TextGrad
**. It is a powerful framework performing automatic ‚Äúdifferentiation‚Äù via text.¬†**It backpropagates textual feedback pro
vided by LLMs to improve individual components of a compound AI system.**¬†In this framework, LLMs provide rich, general,
 natural language suggestions to optimize variables in computation graphs, ranging from code snippets to molecular struc
tures. TextGrad showed effectiveness and generality across various applications, from question-answering and molecule op
timization to radiotherapy treatment planning.

[**TextGrad: Improving Prompting Using AutoGrad**](https://medium.com/ai
guys/textgrad-controlling-llm-behavior-via-text-2a82e2073d10?sk=3633a9aa63b884c97469bce659265921)

The addition of RAG t
o LLMs was an excellent idea. It helped the LLMs to become more specific and individualized. Adding new components to an
y system leads to more interactions and its own sets of problems. Adding RAG to LLMs leads to several problems such as h
ow to retrieve the best content, what type of prompt to write, and many more.

In this blog, we are going to combine the
¬†**LangChain RAG with DSPy**. We deep dive into how to evaluate the RAG pipeline quantitatively using¬†**RAGAs**¬†and how 
to create a system where instead of manually tweaking prompts, we let the system figure out the best prompt.

Build LangChain RAG With DSPy?**](https://medium.com/aiguys/how-to-build-langchain-rag-with-dspy-ce9154fbafaa?sk=b41d104

As the field of natural language processing (NLP) advances, the evaluation of large language
 models (LLMs) like GPT-4 becomes increasingly important and complex. Traditional metrics such as accuracy are often ina
dequate for assessing these models‚Äô performance because they fail to capture the nuances of human language. In this arti
cle, we will explore why evaluating LLMs is challenging and discuss effective methods like BLEU and ROUGE for a more com
prehensive evaluation.

# AI Monthly News

# AI Act enters into force

On 1 August 2024, th
e European Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) enters into force. The Act aims to foster responsible artificial intelli
gence development and deployment in the EU. The AI Act introduces a uniform framework across all EU countries, based on 
a forward-looking definition of AI and a risk-based approach:

* **Minimal risk:**¬†most AI systems such as spam filters 
and AI-enabled video games face no obligation under the AI Act, but companies can voluntarily adopt additional codes of 
conduct.
* **Specific transparency risk:**¬†systems like chatbots must clearly inform users that they are interacting wit
h a machine, while certain AI-generated content must be labelled as such.
* **High risk:**¬†high-risk AI systems such as 
AI-based medical software or AI systems used for recruitment must comply with strict requirements, including risk-mitiga
tion systems, high-quality of data sets, clear user information, human oversight, etc.
* **Unacceptable risk:**¬†for exam
ple, AI systems that allow ‚Äúsocial scoring‚Äù by governments or companies are considered a clear threat to people‚Äôs fundam
ental rights and are therefore banned.

# California AI bill SB-1047 sparks fierce debate, Senator likens it to ‚ÄòJets vs. Sharks‚Äô feud


**Key Aspects of SB-1047:**

* Regulation Scope: Targets ‚Äúfrontier‚Äù AI models, defined by their immense computational t
raining requirements (over 10¬≤‚Å∂ operations) or significant financial investment (>$100 million).
* Compliance Requiremen
ts: Developers must implement safety protocols, including the ability to immediately shut down, cybersecurity measures, 
and risk assessments, before model deployment.
* Whistleblower Protections: Encourages reporting of non-compliance or ri
sks by offering protection against retaliation.
* Safety Incident Reporting: Mandates reporting AI safety incidents with
in 72 hours to a newly established Frontier Model Division.
* Certification: Developers need to certify compliance, pote
ntially under penalty of perjury in earlier drafts, though amendments might have altered this.

**Pros:**

* Safety Firs
t: Prioritizes the prevention of catastrophic harms by enforcing rigorous safety standards, potentially safeguarding aga
inst AI misuse or malfunction.
* Incentivizes Responsible Development: By setting high standards for AI model training, 
the company encourages developers to think critically about the implications of their creations.
* Public Trust: Enhance
s public confidence in AI by ensuring transparency and accountability in the development process.

**Cons:**

* Innovati
on Stagnation: Critics argue it might stifle innovation, especially in open-source AI, due to the high costs and regulat
ory burdens of compliance.
* Ambiguity: Some definitions and requirements might be too specific or broad, leading to leg
al challenges or unintended consequences.
* Global Competitiveness: There‚Äôs concern that such regulations could push AI 
development outside California or the U.S., benefiting other nations without similar restrictions.
* Implementation Chal
lenges: The practicalities of enforcing such regulations, especially the ‚Äúpositive safety determination,‚Äù could be compl
ex and contentious.

# MORE OpenAI drama

OpenAI co-founder John
 Schulman has left the company to join rival AI startup Anthropic, while OpenAI president and co-founder Greg Brockman i
s taking an extended leave until the end of the year. Schulman, who played a key role in creating the AI-powered chatbot
 platform ChatGPT and led OpenAI‚Äôs alignment science efforts, stated his move was driven by a desire to focus more on AI
 alignment and hands-on technical work. Peter Deng, a product manager who joined OpenAI last year, has also left the com
pany. With these departures, only three of OpenAI‚Äôs original 11 founders remain: CEO Sam Altman, Brockman, and Wojciech 
Zaremba, lead of language and code generation.

deeplearning -  [ Creating a project on NLP ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1ey2e85/creating_a_project_on_nlp/) , 2024-09-15-0913
```
So me and my friend completed the ML and DL specialization by AndrewNg, and were just gonna get started on a project. We
 decided to make a academic assistant. So basically what this does is a user can upload a PDF,text file or any other sup
ported media and the can ask questions related to it's contents. The main objective being making learning quick given la
rger documents.

The pipeline we decided is pretty standard for such a project.

1. Split the text into chunks
2. Genera
te embeddings of the chunks
3. Store the chunks in a vector DB
4. Find the top K similar chunks to the query 
5. Retriev
e context and feed it into a LLM for an answer.

So I looked up for a library and framework to use and decided on langch
ain. We haven't decided on an LLM yet but want to run it locally so no OpenAI please. 

Since this is gonna be out first
 AI project confidence is low. I would really appreciate any heads up on the issues we may face, any suggestions on libr
aries,frameworks or models will be really helpful as well. 

Appreciate any resourceful comment üòä
