With AI apps popping up everywhere, it’s fair to think building one is both easy and cheap.

Unfortunately, you’d be *(m
ostly)* wrong. I know because I learned the hard way.

I’m not saying it’s hard per se, but as of this writing, gpt-4-tu
rbo costs $0.01/$0.03 per 1000 input/output tokens. This can quickly add up if you’re building a complex AI workflow.

Y
es, you could use less expensive, worse performing models, like GPT 3.5 or an open-source one like Llama, stuff everythi
ng into one API call with excellent prompt engineering, and hope for the best. But this probably won’t turn out that gre
at. This type of approach doesn’t really work in production—at least not yet with the current state of AI.

**It could g
ive you the right answer 90% or even 99% of the time.** But that one time it decides to go off the rails, it’s really fr
ustrating. As a developer and/or business, you know you must never break a user’s experience. It might be okay for a toy
 app or prototype but not for a production-grade application you charge for.

Imagine if Salesforce or any other establi
shed software company said its reliability was only one or two nines. That would be insane. No one would use it.

**But 
this is the state of most AI applications today. They’re unreliable.**

# AI isn’t a Universal Function

The non-determi
nistic nature of LLMs forces us to be more thoughtful about how we write our code. We should not just “hope” that an LLM
 will always correctly respond. We need to build redundancy and proper error handling. For some reason, many builders fo
rget everything they learned about software engineering and treat AI like some magical universal function that doesn’t f
ail.

**It’s not there yet.**

To fix this limitation, we must write code that only interacts with AI when absolutely ne
cessary—that is, when a system needs some sort of “human-level” analysis of unstructured data. Subsequently, whenever po
ssible, we must force the LLM to return references to information (i.e., a pointer) instead of the data itself.

**When 
I recognized these two things, I had to redesign the backend architecture of my personal software business completely.**


# Rearchitecting Jellypod

For context, I started an app called Jellypod. It enables users to subscribe to email newsl
etters and get a daily summary of the most important topics from all of them as a single podcast.

This seems pretty sim
ple on the outside—and the MVP honestly was. The app would just process each email individually, summarize it, convert i
t to speech, and stitch all the audio together, side-by-side, into a daily podcast.

The output was fine, but it needed 
to be better.

If two different newsletters discussed the same topic, the “podcast” would talk about it twice, not reali
zing we had already mentioned it. You could say, “Well, why don’t you just stuff all the newsletter content into one big
 LLM call to summarize everything?”

Well, that’s what I tried at first.

And it failed. **Miserably.**

Even with an ex
tremely detailed prompt using all the best practices, I couldn’t guarantee that the LLM would always detect the most imp
ortant topics, summarize everything, and consistently create an in-depth output. Also, the podcast always needed to be \
~10 minutes long.

So I went back to the drawing board. How can I make this system better? And yes, we’re getting to the
 cost reduction part - don’t worry!

# Defining the Requirements

Jellypod must be able to process any number of input d
ocuments (newsletters) and create an output that always includes the top ten most important topics across all those inpu
ts. If two subparts of any input are about the same topic, we should recognize that and merge the sections into one topi
c.

For example, if the Morning Brew has a section about US Elections and the Daily Brief also has a section on the curr
ent state of US Politics, they should be merged. I’ll skip over how I determined a similarity threshold (i.e., should tw
o topics be merged or remain separate).

# Exploding Costs

I built on top of a few different approaches outlined in pap
ers written by the LangChain community to semantic chunk and organize everything in a almost deterministic way.

**But t
his was INSANELY expensive.** The number of API calls grew at a rate of O(n log n), with n being the number of input chu
nks from all newsletters.

So, I had a dilemma. Do I keep this improved and more expensive architecture or throw it down
 the drain?

I decided to keep it and figure out how to reduce costs.

# Reducing Costs

That’s when I discovered a tool
 called OpenPipe that allows you to fine-tune open-source models almost too easily. It looked legit and was backed by YC
ombinator, so I gave it a try.

I swapped out the OpenAI SDK with their SDK (a drop-in replacement), which passed all my
 LLM API calls to OpenAI but recorded all inputs and outputs. This created unique datasets for each of my prompts, which
 I could use to fine-tune a cheaper open-source model.

After about a week of recording Jellypod’s LLM calls, I had abou
t 50,000 rows of data. And with a few clicks, I fine-tuned a Mistral 7B model for each LLM call.

I replaced GPT-4 with 
the new fine-tuned model.

**And it reduced the costs by 88%.**

The cost of inference dropped from $10 per 1M input tok
ens to $1.20. And cost per output token dropped from $30 to $1.60.

I was blown away. I could now run Jellypod’s new arc
hitecture for approximately the same cost as the MVP’s trivial approach. I even confirmed that the fine-tuned Mistral ou
tput quality was just as high as GPT-4 by a series of evals and in-app customer feedback.

By redesigning the system to 
only use AI for the smallest unit of work it’s actually needed for, I could confidently deploy a fine-tuned model as a d
rop-in replacement for GPT 4. And by prompting to return pointers to data instead of the data itself, I could ensure dat
a integrity while reducing the number of output tokens consumed.

# In Conclusion

If you’re considering building an AI 
application, I would encourage you to take a step back and think about your architecture’s output reliability and costs.
 What happens if the LLM doesn’t answer your prompt in the right way? Can you prompt the model to return data identifier
s instead of raw data? And, is it possible to swap GPT-4 with a cheaper, fine-tuned model?

I wish I had these insights 
when I started, but hey, you live and learn.

I hope you found at least some parts of this interesting! I thought there 
were enough learnings to share. Feel free to reach out if you’re curious about the details.

```
Hi folks, I'm putting together a simple Github RAG chatbot using \`GithubRepoLoader\` and Pinecone vector store. However
 when upserting the embeddings to Pinecone, the upsert process fails with the error: \`PineconeBadRequestError: Missing 
low surrogate.\`  
After a bit of research this seem to be due to how UTF-16 encodes the Unicode Characters outside the 
BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane) are represented using a pair of surrogate code points in UTF-16 encoding. The error messa
ge indicates that a high surrogate code point (D800–DBFF) was found without a corresponding low surrogate (DC00–DFFF) fo
llowing it.  
Now with that being said, my question is:   
Would it be feasible to use UTF-8 instead? Where would be a g
ood place (at what level of the stack) in the code would you make some changes to inject a parameter for a different (i.
e. UTF-8) encoding?

```
In my experience developing RAG-based applications with LangChain, I was surprised to find that there aren't any simple,
 reliable ways to chunk files. The default [Text Splitters](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/docume
nt_transformers/) that LangChain offers employ a naive form of chunking that doesn't consider positioning data like sect
ions, subsections, paragraphs or tables. 

This led me to implement my own chunking service that includes deep positioni
ng data like page index and bounding box coordinates for every chunk.

You can try it out for free here (no account/api 
key required):

I have a list of these and I'm using AzureOpenAI() as my embeddings model to create a vecto

My end goal is
 to generate end to end flow of these APIs for testing purposes for the given api and original prompt is 
 agent.run('Wh

3-4 APIs .

Yeah, it is fairly simple to set up a custom chatbot on  with the server feature. This way, you  can use any chatbot  th
at you have an api for, and make poe the user interface. Im so happy i found this, going to have a lot of fun trying all
 the new models without having to pay a subscription im not going to use to the fullest.

Basicly, you write some python
 code, deploy it on modal website which offer 30 dollars of compute per month for free, and this will only require max 1
dollar since it isnt the one doing the inference. Then connect it to poe and you are up and running. The only problem is
, that the documentation is confusing as f, but i feel like i understand it completely now, and it is fairly simple. Fee
l free to ask.

  
Note: this way you can make infinite chatbots and even do langchain or very complicated agents and mu
ch more, much cheaper even. Consider making a model, that uses some advanced prompt tactic before it comes up with the a
nswer. Possible!, on the web, available on your phone, anywhere.

all -  [ Career Direction for a heavily technical but well rounded SE ](https://www.reddit.com/r/salesengineers/comments/1b8e8k9/career_direction_for_a_heavily_technical_but_well/) , 2024-03-09-0909
```
Hoping to get some internet wisdom here. My career has taken me from M&A and management consulting, to running a family 
business in petro equipment remanufacturing, and in the past \~8 years in Data Engineering, Data Science, and setting up
 a SE department.    


Here’s a quick rundown of my career path:

* **Early Career:** Undergrad in finance, first job i
n management consulting (M&A), ran systems engineering and sales for a family business while I was at PwC concurrently.

* **Shift to Tech:** Sold the family business and knew I wanted to do something heavily technical. Moved to TN, did a bo
otcamp and got linked with a network of heavy hitters in the health tech scene.  Ran BI and DW for a health tech start u
p, exited, and was recruited to do big-data DE for another startup. Earned my MS in Data Science from Georgia Tech, init
ially transitioning from data engineering to data science.
* **Move to SE:** I built a few prototypes and did some R&D o
n the side which landed some big clients outside of our target industry (our PE overlords pegged it at $150m of addition
al TAM).  Also did a side project which ended up featured in the New York Times and a bunch of other health tech publica
tions.  That generated enough interest that the C-Suite asked me to setup a sales engineering department (easy move beca
use DS was moving way too slow for my taste).
* **Tech and Sales Intersection:** Automated a lot of our sales team's pro
cesses which sped them up and built a few prototypes and case studies to land $2M in ARR within my first 8 months in the
 formal SE role.
* **Skills and Interests:** I'm deep into Spark (Scala, PySpark, SparkSQL), Python, SQL, DW architectur
e (big and normal data environments), Azure Cloud infrastructure, Machine Learning, LLMs / Agents, and Tableau (regretta
bly). My W2 expertise is largely in healthcare economy data but I’ve also built a side-project with a FastAPI, langchain
 backend / retool front-end to support a buddy from college who wants to expand his crypto hedge fund. I'm technically v
ery well rounded.

**What I’m Looking For:**

* Insight into sales or sales engineering roles that need someone who’s no
t just technical but *really* technical. I love programming and building things but also have a track record of closing 
deals and building stuff to make my sales team faster.
* To connect with folks in tech-heavy SE roles to understand what
 their day-to-day and teams look like.

**Why I’m Exploring:**

* Growth concerns with my current company, especially gi
ven our target industry's slim margins.
* I’m the go-to engineer on the non-engineering side, often stretched thin acros
s tasks that don’t align with my role or support my commission goals.
* Despite significant contributions, especially on
 the consulting/research side, it’s not reflecting in my compensation.

Would love to hear your thoughts, experiences, o
r if you know of roles that might fit my blend of skills and passions I've got going on.

```
I saw the previous discussion about using double curly braces inside a template to avoid expansion in a prompt's format 
method.

However, I'm still having a problem with this, even with double curly-braces, when I use a \`FewShotPrompt\`.  
I have \*examples\* in the FSP that contain code. So I suspect what is going wrong is that the double curly-braces help 
when the examples are folded into the prompt, but then when the \*input\* is folded in, the double curly braces have bee
n stripped and I get an error.

This seems like a numbskull problem on my part, so even just a pointer to some tutorial 
about using a FewShotPrompt with code (surely there must be one?) would be great.

```
I am using assistant api as agent in the LangChain framework. I’m using gpt4-0125-preview for this agent. The reason why
 I use agent is because I do not want every query to search the database. And I find the assistant api agent is smarter 
than the ReAct agent in terms of generating responses.

I have only one tool for linking to a retrieval chain. When the 
user asks certain question, the agent invokes a chain and pass query into the retrieval system. I pass in gpt-4-preview-
0125 for the retrieval chain.
To improve the retrieval process, I use multi-query to help generate sub questions from th
e original questions to dig into the details. I use gpt3.5-1106 for the multi query retriever as this doesn’t require mu
ch reasoning. So essentially,
I use the assistant api(gpt-4-0125) as agent, gpt4-0125 for the retrieval chain and gpt3.5
 1106 as the multi query retriever.

In terms of data preparation. I use manual chunking. By manual chunking I mean I ma
nually gather relevant content into one ‘document’. This is because I see splitter does not consider context so it’s bet
ter to do the chunking on my own. 

The problem is that the average response time for 1000-2000 token is ranging from 10
s to 30s. I tried using gpt3.5 as the agent in assistant api. Speed cuts down to 3-10s. But the generation is way worse.
 This one I’m not sure why as I keep the gpt4-0125 in the retrieval chain. I assume the generation should be good…

How 
should I improve my architecture to enhance speed?

Curious what everybody is using to implement LLM powered apps for production usage and your experience with these toolin
gs and advice. 

This is what I am using for some RAG prototypes I have been building for users in finance and capital m
arkets.

**Pre-processing\ETL:**
Unstructured.io + Spark, Airflow

**Embedding model:**
Cohere Embed v3
Previously using
 OpenAI Ada but Cohere has significantly better retrieval recall and precision for my use case. Also exploring other ope
n weights embedding models

**Vector Database:**
Elasticsearch previously but now using Pinecone

**LLM:**
Gone through 
quite a few including hosted and self-hosted options. Went with gpt4 early during prototyping then switched to gpt3.5-tu
rbo for more manageable costs and eventually open weights models. 

Now using a fine-tuned Llama2 70B model self hosted 
with vLLM 

**LLM Framework:**
Started with Langchain initially but found it cumbersome to extend as the app became more
 complex. Tried implementing it in LlamaIndex at some point just to learn and found it just as bad. Went back to Langcha
in and now I am in the midst of replacing it with my own logic

What is everyone else using?

Edit: correct model Llama2
 70B

Hey there, Redditors!

I'm back with the latest installment on creating dependable AI data pipelines for real-world prod
uction.

If you've been following along, you know I'm on a mission to move beyond the '[thin OpenAI wrapper](https://top
oteretes.notion.site/Going-beyond-Langchain-Weaviate-and-towards-a-production-ready-modern-data-platform-7351d77a1eba40a
ab4394c24bef3a278?pvs=4)' trend and tackle the challenges of building robust data pipelines.

After a few months of work
, we integrated cognitive architecture with [keepi.ai](https://www.keepi.ai) 

We aim to explore with our demo:

**1. Co
ntext sanitization**  
The world of AI is fast-moving, and we've realized that the context is becoming a building block 
we refer to as a crucial part of future cognitive architecture.  
**2. Best Practices for AI Memory**  
In this rapidly 
evolving landscape, there are no established best practices. You'll need to make educated bets on tools and processes, k
nowing that things will change. We assume that having traditional data engineering practices + frameworks + classifiers 
and other AI solutions can solve a lot of standard hurdles  
**3. AI Frameworks**  
They are trying to do too much, too 
fast, too broad. We want to find a pattern and a correct layer of abstraction for the AI memory to fit new industry.

Next steps:  
I have questions for you:

1. Is context sanitization relevant for you?
2. How do you m
anage metadata? 
3. How do you prepare data for LLMs?
4. Are there any data enrichment steps you perform?

MachineLearning -  [ [D] AI projects Suggestions ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1aunkmw/d_ai_projects_suggestions/) , 2024-03-09-0909
```
Hi Everyone, I need a suggestion to create AI courses for students ( Hands-on AI projects). I am thinking about the late
st AI trends such as Langchain, RAG, and vector databases. In each project, there can be multiple tasks, and the main th
ing is each task should have an automated system in which we can verify whether students have done it correctly or not.


For example: Project with visualization cannot be automatically tested. 

For example: A project with visualization can
not be automatically tested. . em can verify if the length of the text is smaller we can verify that it is correct.

MachineLearning -  [ Whats in your RAG setup? [D] ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1apcp2w/whats_in_your_rag_setup_d/) , 2024-03-09-0909
```
What frameworks and libraries are you using in your RAG? 

I'm most curious if  LangChain is as popular as it was?

Here
's mine at a high-level: 

*  langchain to use OpenAI for creating embeddings
* Pinecone for storing embedding
* langcha
in to load document splitters and characters splitters for chunking
* Mongo for conversations memory
