all -  [ LLMs Or What Even Are Those? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1cff5pa/llms_or_what_even_are_those/) , 2024-04-29-0910
```
**Large Language Models**, or LLMs, are advanced AI systems that enhance text prediction to an exceptional level — imagi
ne the autocorrect & text prediction on your phone, but far more sophisticated.

When you type 'I am going to the...', y
our phone might suggest words like 'store' or 'gym.', based on the words you wrote before. LLMs operate similarly, but o
n a much larger scale, using vast amounts of text to predict and generate language accurately.

**The Core Pillars of LL
Ms are:**

* **Transformer Models** - the backbone of most LLMs, these models process data by breaking down input text i
nto smaller parts (tokens) and analyzing the relationships between them. This helps the model understand and generate la
nguage based on the context provided.Just like our brain uses neurons to process and relay information, transformer mode
ls use tokens to process and generate language, making sense of the input based on context.
* **Training** - LLMs learn 
by consuming vast amounts of text data, from websites like Wikipedia to books and articles. This training allows them to
 understand language patterns and context, and, as a result, generate better text.It’s just like reading hundreds of boo
ks to enhance your knowledge and master a subject, we feed LLMs with text data from diverse sources like Wikipedia and v
arious books to help them learn, though with a small caveat — LLMs can do this anywhere from 100-1000 times *faster* tha
n us.
* **Fine-tuning** - after their initial training, LLMs can be fine-tuned with specific data sets to perform tasks 
like translation, content generation, or even coding.With fine-tuning, you’re giving your little helper a specific role 
& legend to fill — for example, 'Sir Code-a-lot”, who, after his rigorous initial training, is now sharpening the specif
ic skills needed to slay the mighty dragons in the C++ Language.

And if you want to see how different your autocorrect 
& text prediction on your phone is from actual Large Language Models – then here’s a cool visual showing the sheer scale
 of the various GPT LLMs Essentially, LLMs predict what comes next, depending on the context & your input. If you’re a p
rogrammer and you’re writing code in Python, and use an LLM-powered code editor, the model understands every line of cod
e you’ve written and suggests the next one accurately!

**The History of LLMs & Transformers**

The evolution of LLMs (*
*Large Language Models**) began with the introduction of the Transformer model by Google at NeurIPS 2017. 

This model i
ntroduced a new approach called 'attention mechanisms' that improves how machines understand the context within text. Ba
sically, a Transformer allows the model to focus on different parts of the input data at different times, improving its 
ability to generate accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

This model led to significant developments such as
 BERT and GPT models. GPT models, starting from GPT-1 to the latest iterations like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, have significantl
y advanced in capabilities, achieving tasks that range from simple text generation to complex decision-making and proble
m-solving tasks.

And you know what’s the best part about LLMs becoming mainstream? 

Nearly every SaaS company is lever
aging them by building apps to solve the problems we creators & entrepreneurs face daily – responding to emails, schedul
ing meetings, finding time for family and leisure, data entry, everything you could imagine — there’s an LLM-based tool 
for it now.

Hi everyone,

In my experience, my company does a lot of work on LLMs and I can say with absolute certainty that those p
rojects are permutations and combinations of making an intelligent chatbot which can chat with your proprietary document
s, summarize information, build dashboards and so on. I've prototyped these RAG systems (nothing in production, thankful
ly) and am not enjoying building them. I also don't like the LLM framework wars (Langchain vs Llamaindex vs this and tha
t - although, Langchain sucks in my opinion).   


What I am interested in putting my data scientist / (fake) statistici
an hat back on and approach LLMs (and related topics) from a research perspective. What are the problems to solve in thi
s field? What are the pressing research questions? What are the topics that I can explore in my personal (or company) ti
me beyond RAG systems?

Finally, can anyone explain what the heck is agentic AI? Is it just a fancy buzzword for this se
ntence from Russell and Norvig's magnum opus AI book- ' A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outc
ome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome'.

can work on the metadata extraction aspect because I'm using local llms and using them for summaries and QA pairs of the
 entire scraped db would take too long to do in real time. Also since my systems Open Domain, would fine-tuning the embe

I was thinking hybrid search but then I'm also hearing knowledge graphs are great? idk. Saw a pap

```
I'm encountering a recurring issue with slug size limitations on Heroku, primarily driven by unnecessary dependencies of
 the Langchain library

Despite implementing a `.slugignore` file, the slug is still >3GB, which is much too large.

Aft
er following [this Heroku support guide](https://help.heroku.com/KUFMEES1/my-slug-size-is-too-large-how-can-i-make-it-sm
aller), I identified the main culprits as the `torch` and `scipy` dependencies of `langchain`.  
  
I can get it to work
 locally by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` , excluding  `torch` and `scipy`, from `requirements.txt`,  then run
ning `pip install -r requirements --no-deps`.

This installs all of the necessary libraries without `torch` and `scipy`.


The problem is: **I cannot replicate this on Heroku.** i.e. I can't find a way to install `langchain` and its \*requir
ed\* dependencies while excluding non-essential dependencies for my use case, namely `torch` and `scipy`.  
  
Here's wh
at I've tried so far:

1. **Initial Attempt:**
   * I modified my deployment process to include `release: pip install -r
 requirements --no-deps` in the Procfile after excluding `torch` and `scipy` from my dependencies.
   * However, this ap
proach did not prevent these libraries from being installed, as it seems the command in the Procfile is executed *in add
ition* to the standard `pip install -r requirements.txt` (which I believe [this guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/arti
cles/release-phase) confirms).
2. **Subsequent Strategy:**
   * I consolidated all necessary dependencies into `requirem
ents.txt`, excluding `torch` and `scipy`.
   * I then attempted to use `release: pip install -r requirements-langchain.t
xt --no-deps` in my ` Procfile` for Langchain-specific dependencies (i.e. only `langchain` and its required dependencies
).
3. **Resulting Error:**
   * Post-implementation, the application failed to build, throwing a `ModuleNotFoundError` f
or `langchain_openai`. The logs indicated a transition from state up to crashed due to this error, detailed as follows: 
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain_openai'` (note: this was explicitly included in ` requirements-langchai
n.txt`)
4. **Dependency Management:**
   * Despite ensuring all Langchain dependencies were listed in `requirements-lang
chain.txt` and seemingly installed via the Procfile command, runtime errors suggest these modules are not accessible dur
ing execution.

I suspect there might be a misunderstanding or misconfiguration with my use of the `release:` command in
 my `Procfile`, affecting how dependencies are managed and recognized at runtime.  
  
I'd love some guidance on configu
ring my deployment to avoid the installation of superfluous large dependencies while ensuring all necessary libraries ar
e correctly recognized and accessible by the application.

Thank you very much for your help.

I was trying to build a custom RAG pipeline to fetch contextual data from an already existing Knowledge Graph (NebulaGra

What i noticed from both llama-index and langchain packages was that they actually use the LLM to generate the g

Does this not limit the entire efficiency as if th
e LLM did not correctly follow the instruction and couldn’t  generate the cypher correctly?

Found a way to generate ind
ex embeddings in neo4j and retrieve documents off similarity search, which does not work very efficiently in fetching al
l the connected information from the graph.

So the big question.
Is there a  better way to implement KG Based RAG?

```
While RAG is undeniably impressive, the process of creating a functional application with it can be daunting. There's a 
significant amount to grasp regarding implementation and development practices, ranging from selecting the appropriate A
I models for the specific use case to organizing data effectively to obtain the desired insights. While tools like LangC
hain and LlamaIndex exist to simplify the prototype design process, there has yet to be an accessible, ready-to-use open
-source RAG template that incorporates best practices and offers modular support, allowing anyone to quickly and easily 
utilize it.  
TrueFoundry has recently introduced a new open-source framework called [Cognita](https://github.com/truefo
undry/cognita), which utilizes Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to simplify the transition by providing r
obust, scalable solutions for deploying AI applications. AI development often begins in experimental environments such a
s Jupyter notebooks, which are useful for prototyping but not well-suited for production environments. However, Cognita 
aims to bridge this gap. Developed on top of Langchain and LlamaIndex, Cognita offers a structured and modular approach 
to AI application development. Each component of the RAG, from data handling to model deployment, is designed to be modu
lar, API-driven, and extendable.

 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1cemgtd/microsoft_launches_tiny_ai_model_phi3/) , 2024-04-29-0910
```
Microsoft announced its smallest AI model yet, Phi-3. This model, measuring just 3.8 billion parameters, was learned fro
m ‘bedtime stories’ created by other LLMs. Thanks to innovations in learning, the company says this family outperforms t
he same and next-size models on a range of tests assessing language, programming, and math abilities.

The new model is a
vailable in the Microsoft Azure AI Model Catalog and on Hugging Face, as well as Ollama, a lightweight framework for run
ning models on a local machine. Microsoft says it will also be available as an NVIDIA NIM microservice with a standard A
PI interface that can be deployed anywhere.

I'm looking for a part-time LLM engineer to build some AI agent workflows. It's remote.

Most job boards don't seem to h
ave this category yet. And the person I'd want wouldn't need to have tons of AI or software engineering experience anywa

Any good ideas on where to fin

```
hey! are you experimenting with langchain or just `'format': 'json'`, but have noticed incredibly slow output compared t
o regular formatting? this is because ollama allows the model to output whitespace forever, and eventually cancels the r
equest when it repeats `\n` or a space too many times. this makes json pretty slow.

there is currently an [open pull re
quest](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/3784) which solves this issue and makes json output speedy. you can use [th
is branch on their fork](https://github.com/hughescr/ollama/tree/bugfix/disallow-possibly-infinite-trailing-whitespace-i
n-json) in order to solve the issue yourself.

```
In recent weeks, numerous engineers have explored [Cognita](https://github.com/truefoundry/cognita), providing invaluabl
e insights and feedback. We deeply appreciate your input and encourage ongoing dialogue (share your thoughts in the comm
ents – let's keep this ‘open source’).

While RAG is undoubtedly powerful, the process of building a functional applicat
ion with it can feel overwhelming. From selecting the right AI models to organizing data effectively, there's a lot to n
avigate. While tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex simplify prototyping, an accessible, ready-to-use open-source RAG tem
plate with modular support is still missing. That's where Cognita comes in.

Key benefits of Cognita:

1. Central reposi
tory for parsers, loaders, embedders, and retrievers. 2. User-friendly UI empowers non-technical users to upload documen
ts and engage in Q&A. 3. Fully API-driven for seamless integration with other systems.

We invite you to explore Cognita
 and share your feedback as we refine and expand its capabilities. Interested in contributing? Join the journey at [http

Hey everyone, our small engineering team is exploring RAG for querying our massive internal document system. It's exciti
ng, but also a little overwhelming with all the choices - LLMs, embedding models, vector databases, hyperparameters... y
ou name it!

Here's what we're thinking:

* Manually create a test set of 10-20 custom Q&As (should we allow multiple an
swer options?).
* Automate deployment of various combinations: different LLMs, hyperparameters, embedding models, etc.
*
 Compare the generated answers to our gold standard answers (thinking ROUGE score for evaluation).

Does this approach s
ound reasonable? Are there any tools or frameworks out there that can streamline this process for a small team like ours
? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Hey there, Redditors!

I'm back with the latest installment on creating deterministic LLM memory.

If you've been follow
ing along, you know I'm on a mission to move beyond the '[thin OpenAI wrapper](https://topoteretes.github.io/cognee/blog
/2023/10/05/going-beyond-langchain--weaviate-and-towards-a-production-ready-modern-data-platform/)' trend and tackle the
 challenges of building robust LLM memory.

  
That's why we built cognee, a python library to process documents and bui
ld knowledge graphs on top of them.

After a few weeks of work, we integrated DSPy and extended cognee.

Here is brief o
verview of the logic: 

[Architecture overview](https://preview.redd.it/fcs3lifx53wc1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=web
p&s=9316cba52147a5b764565b8438f3f143d8e7ac84)

We aim to understand:

1. Have you tried building knowledge graphs with o
ther tools before?

2. If so, what were the biggest obstacles?

3. How would you approach semantic linking of documents 
without knowledge graphs?

I'm not using Lanchain but only making API calls to an LLM service provider. The retriever is connected to a vector DB, 
and I would like to know what the LLM refers to WITHIN that retrieved context whenever it provides an answer, similar to
 how return_source_documents works in Langchain.

I'm using AzureOpenAI. I couldn't find much in their docs that related
 to returning the source documents. Any help will be greatly appreciated!

Hi all

I am presented with a problem that I need to solve using LLM to get the right data from text that has only \~20%
 structure to it. Here's a sample data

XXXXX

AA          BB

CCCC:  (optional DDDD)

C1......(A1) (B1)

C2......(A2) (
B2)

C3.....(A3) (B3)

I am required to anwer with either of these results from A1/B1 till A3/B3 pairs but in order to d
o that I need to go back and ask the user which one of the options C1 to C3 applies to him?

The above is not the most c
omplex structure, it increases in complexity from here so a lot of chatting with user is required to get to the right da
ta that will always exist in the chunk like above.

In the most simplist case the data structure will look like below

X
XXXX

AA          BB

CCCC: ......(A1) (B1)



How would you build a system like this? I am looking at multi-agent syste
ms with Langchain, what about prompt chaining?
