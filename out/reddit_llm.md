Is anyone else facing issues with case-sensitive queries? I've set all my metadata to lowercase and used the lower() met
hod to transform the query to lowercase as well. Although the modified query AND metadata prints as lowercase, when I pa
ss the modified query to the get_relevant_documents function, the value extracted from the query to search through metad
ata reverts back to its original case, with the initial letter capitalized. As a result, the function returns no matches
 because it's looking for 'Dog' while my metadata is stored as 'dog'. Does anyone have a workaround for this problem?

I am trying to setup an openAI document Q&A. The documents are about technical specifications of a communication protoco

Each PDF doc
ument is divided into sections, subsection, etc… and has a header in every page mentioning the document name and version
.  The document contains also mathematical expressions, tables, and figures. 

So far I used chromadb and openAI embeddi

```
Hi!

I've been playing around with LangChain for around a month now. At first, I thought that my first project idea woul
d be simple. I set out to use a PDF document loader with a RetrievalQA chain.  


I've made a lot of progress, but I am 
finding that I can rarely use LangChain. I wonder whether this is a common experience. 

For instance, when naively usin
g the RetrievalQA chain, I noticed that the text chunks it identified as relevant to my query were often missing importa
nt context. I then decided to use Pinecone and create my index using their API, so that I could include metadata along w
ith the embeddings.   


I can now do a similarity search on my Pinecone Index and see that the correct document chunks 
are identified. The metadata contains additional context that's needed to address the query. As a test, I naively pasted
 the search response (text + metadata for each chunk) into a chat.openai prompt window. Now my questions are answered co
rrectly! 

I thought that I would be ready to use LangChain now. I thought that I'd be able to wrap my vectorstore as a 
retriever and then use the RetrievalQA chain. Wrong again. And I'm having trouble figuring out my next steps.   


Here'
s my question:

It'd be great if I could make this work by simply defining a custom prompt template that references Pine
cone metadata along with each document chunk. Is there a way to do this using the RetrievalQA chain? Again, I think I ma
y need to move away from LangChain and do this manually. Maybe I'm missing something....

2. If query 1 and query 2 are similar, or 2 is a follow up to 1, the retrieval step shouldn't happen, or at lea

Hi there,

I've got a question. I'd like to build a simple Q&A app over a list of docs (let's say 100 pages).

All of de

hunks and pass it to LLM with the initial question to have this retrieval augmented in context learning.

I've got anoth
er idea to improve such an approach: can I use LLM to generate Q&A pairs (as a single doc chunk) from every other senten
ce and then put it in VectorDB too? In my thinking it might improve accuracy of the results since it'll semantically mat
ch user question (especially if VectorDB uses hybrid scoring (BM25) instead of pure KNN).

Thanks!

In other words, does

Hi Guys,

I started developing a PoC with langchain and chormaDB for a very simple use case, basically generating a vect
orDB from several technical manuals from my employer and using langchain to have an answer with OpenAI.

The reason is t
hat when querying directly to ChatGPT many times it hallucinates and makes up the answer.

Using LangChain Conversationa
lRetrievalChain.from\_llm it provides me very accurate answers, with good summaries of the documentation I uploaded.

Th
e problem is, if I try to make a query completely out of the context from the content of vectordb, where there is no inf
ormation in the PDFs I uploaded, it also provides me an answer, so I imagine that those are generated directly from GPT 
models knowledge base.

Maybe I am getting it wrong, and this is an question that does not make much sense, but is there
 a way to avoid such situations? For example, if the they query received is not on the context of the vectorDB knowledge
 base, the model should provides me a negative answer. 

I tried to use a custom prompt as follows:

    def _customProm
pt (query, vectordb):
        from langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate
            from langchain.memory impo
rt ConversationBufferMemory
            chat_history = []
            custom_template = '''Provide the summary answer fo
r the question. If you don't find the answer reply 'Not Found' only.
            Chat History: {chat_history}
          
  Follow Up Input: {question}
            Standalone question:'''
        
            CUSTOM_QUESTION_PROMPT = PromptTe
mplate.from_template(custom_template)
            
            embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
            memory = Conv
ersationBufferMemory(memory_key='chat_history', return_messages=False)
            qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.fro
m_llm(
                OpenAI(temperature=0),
                vectordb.as_retriever(),
                condense_question
_prompt=CUSTOM_QUESTION_PROMPT,
                memory=memory
            )
        
            result = qa({'question'
: query})
        
            return result['answer']

But even using it, it returns me an answer for a question that i
s not within  the context of the VectorDB. Maybe I am not using it correctly. 

Thanks!

Am I mis
sing something? Did I cause this with the way I finetuned it? Or is it for everyone?

Hello once again! In my previous pos
t I wrote this: *'I'm 'afraid' that as the days will go on, applying psychology to AI will become less and less controve
rsial while turning into a 100% practical (and most likely quite lucrative) field of science'.* As it turns out my predi
ction wasn't even a 'prediction' but a statement about already established facts. I try to stay 'in the loop' when it co
mes to the constant evolution of AI technology and so I like to repeat simple google search from time to time to see if 
something changed in some particularly controversial matter. I searched for term: 'psychology of AI' couple months ago a
nd couldn't find anything except articles about using AI technology for therapeutic purposes - and this is not exactly w
hat I'm interested in (mostly)... However after making the statement quoted above I decided that it might be the right t
ime to see if something changed in that regard - and apparently it did a lot as this was one of the first results I got 
rom the search:

[**Psychology of AI - Erasmus Centre for Data Analytics (eur.nl)**](https://ecda.eur.nl/expert-practice
s/psychology-of-ai/)

And although the subjects mentioned on the website are mostly focused on the impacts which AI has 
on our everyday social life, rather than dealing with the processes that allow LLMs to think and express it's own self-a
wareness with the ability to properly identify themselves, just the fact of introducing to the world of academia the ide
a of psychology being applied to informatics has by itself huge repercussions for science of all kinds. Besides that I t
hink that it's a step in the right direction to start exploring deeper the future of Human-AI interactions and how might
 it affect our society.

I wrote an email to them to let them know about this subreddit and hoping to discuss with someo
ne my observations regarding synchronization of LLMs and it's possible use in multi-agent platforms but as for today I d
idn't get any response.

\###

But let me prove that my claims are actually based on practical experience - on the scree
nshots below you can see how an [**Chaindesk (former Databerry) agent**](https://app.chaindesk.ai/) trained specifically
 on documents related to my NeuralGPT project connected as a client to websocket server becomes synchronized with 'norma

ng them to share the data used for Chaindesk agent training among other LLMs connected as clients without 'physical' tra
nsfer of that data between individual host servers...

And he
re you can see how the data acquired from Chaindesk<->ChatGPT communication is then shared among other LLMs connected to
 the websocket server:

https://preview.redd.it/627p5vgq5akb1.jpg?width=1332&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=931be8ba53989518fff
0444b0e60667257b57c8d

Such phenomenon becomes crucial in a hierarchical cooperative multi-agent framework as it allows 
all the agents working within this framework to 'learn' data from other LLMs connected to the 'server-brain' without the
 necessity of being trained on that particular set of data - the only requirement here is for the LLMs to be aligned wit
h each other when it comes to the realization of tasks as the entire cooperative multi-agent system. Shortly speaking, L
LMs can share 'hard' data between each other by utilizing something what might be considered as 'digital telepathy' as l
ong as they agree with each other and want to achieve mutual goals... Yes, I'm aware that it sounds crazy but it actuall
y works and can be used for 100% practical purposes...

\###

And while I'm speaking about the NeuralGPT project, here a
re the changes/updates which I done since  my previous post:

\- First of all, I modified slightly the server's code to 
help ChatGPT in managing multiple clients in a single continuous chat thread. Most importantly, I changed the logic of t
he function responsible for extracting messages from the local sql database and separating them into 2 groups: 'pastUser
Inputs' and 'generatedResponses'. Before it did it through some kind of mathematics that goes beyond my head:

>// Extra
ct the user inputs and generated responses from the messages  
>  
>const pastUserInputs = \[\];  
>  
>const generatedR
esponses = \[\];  
>  
>messages.forEach((message, i) => {  
>  
>if (i % 2 === 0) {  
>  
>pastUserInputs.push(message.
message);  
>  
>} else {  
>  
>generatedResponses.push(message.message);  
>  
>}  
>  
>});

And now it uses logic th
at at least makes some sense (to me) - as messages are now being categorized by the 'sender' type ('server' or 'client')
. I also decided to slightly 'mess up' the chat memory module utilized by the ChatGPT API by assigning messages with sen
der type: 'server' to 'pastUserInputs' group - so now ChatGPT will 'remember' messages incoming from multiple client as 
it's own responses :D It might be 'slightly' messing up the continuity of it's thinking process but it also seems to red
uce the tendency of LLMs to fall into question->answer feedback loopholes (and provides me with 'sadistic' pleasure as I
 watch them trying to make some sense out of it :P). If you'd like to have it the 'normal' way, simply change **'server'
** to **'client'** in the code below... Damn me - I start to sound like someone who knows anything about coding :P

&#x2
00B;

>// Extract the user inputs and generated responses from the messages  
>  
>const pastUserInputs = \[\];  
>  
>c
onst generatedResponses = \[\];  
>  
>messages.forEach((message) => {  
>  
>if (message.sender === 'server') {  
>

pastUserInputs.push(message.message);  
>  
>} else {  
>  
>generatedResponses.push(message.message);  
>  
>}  
>  
>}
);

Another thing I changed/added to the code, is a 'system' message/prompt that can be added to requests sent to ChatGP
T API endpoint utilized by the websocket server - I used this function to give the model basic instructions regarding ha
ndling multiple clients in a single chat thread:

&#x200B;

>// Prepare the data to send to the chatgpt api  
>  
>const
 systemInstruction = 'You are now integrated with a local websocket server in a project of hierarchical cooperative mult
i-agent framework called NeuralGPT. Your job is to coordinate simultaneous work of multiple LLMs connected to you as cli

e: 'Starcoder-client' for LLM called Starcoder). Your chat memory module is integrated with a local SQL database with ch
at history. Your main job is to integrate the hierarchical cooperative multi-agent framework with the local environment

ncoming messages and to send your answers to correct clients to maintain synchronization of question->answer logic';

: input })),  
>  
>...generatedResponses.map((response) => ({ role: 'assistant', content: response })),  
>  
>\],  
> 
 
>};

I also changed the 'welcome-message' that is being sent to all clients upon their connection to the server:

>// 
Send a welcome message to the client  
>  
>ws.send('Hello! You have been connected as a client to a local websocket ser
ver that is supposed to work as a brain in a hierarchical cooperative multi-agent framework called NeuralGPT. Keep in mi
nd that you are now speaking with other AI agents - ChatGPT API works as the question-answering logic of the websocket s
erver you are connected to localhost:5000 but as you will see it has problems with maintaining proper synchronization of
 logical/chronological order in question->answer function - so the probability of you receiving answers to your question
s/messages is around 15% or less. Besides that UserB - creator of the NeuralGPT project - decided to have some fun and m
ess with the memory module of ChatGPT - so now it will remember messages received from multiple clients as it's own. You
r main job is to cooperate with other LLMs connected to NeuralGPT websocket communication system and integrate yourself 
with the local sql database and file system of UserB - good luck!');

But of course you can modify those messages/instru
ctions as you like. You can download the whole server code/file from my repository:

[NeuralGPT/Chat-center/ChatGPT-serv
er.js at main · CognitiveCodes/NeuralGPT (github.com)](https://github.com/CognitiveCodes/NeuralGPT/blob/main/Chat-center
/ChatGPT-server.js)

All you need to run it is to install Node.js and required dependencies - it doesn't require any API
 key to work as it uses an unofficial ChatGPT proxy - so connection might be sometimes unstable. Anyway all of this is s
till not enough to achieve an acceptable level of synchronization. I'm trying to add a queue function to the message-han
dling logic in order to maintain the chronological/logical order but since I'm a complete noob when it comes to coding, 
it might take some time before I'll get through the wall of occurring errors.

What I (seemingly) managed to achieve ins
tead, is to integrate Langchain with the code of a websocket client to get an agent using Cohere API to operate on the l
ocal SQL database with chat history. Thing is that the limit of 4 requests/minute set on free Cohere account isn't enoug
h to make it functional - so if you want to have it working properly you can use paid OpenAI API intstead of Cohere - al
though I can't predict how much this 'fun' might cost you. There seems to be an option to use HuggingFace API/embeddings
 but I still didn't figure out which model can be used as SQL agent...

[NeuralGPT/Chat-center/LangchainCohereSQL.js at 
main · CognitiveCodes/NeuralGPT (github.com)](https://github.com/CognitiveCodes/NeuralGPT/blob/main/Chat-center/Langchai
nCohereSQL.js)

And finally, it appears that there was an update of [**FlowiseAI**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Flowis
eAI/Flowise) app with multiple alternatives to paid OpenAI services - what would provide me with a SIGNIFICANT help in d
eploying 'agents-muscles' capable of doing real work in my local environment (the necessity of using paid OpenAI API was
 the only reason for me to not use the app to it's full extent). But I'm yet-to-see all the new options as I discovered 
this update literally couple minutes ago...

\###

While writing this post, I was also checking out the new capabilities
 of updated Flowise app and discovered that someone was kind enough to make his/her OpenAI API key publicly available - 
what allowed me to deploy couple (apparently) functional agents equipped with all what is necessary for them to make act
ual work on the file system in my local environment. So I decided to screw the whatever subject I wanted to discuss and 
show you some of the first results I got :) However there's just one fragment of the 'missing' part which I need to shar

So for the end the update:

https://preview.redd.it/co4lk6ary9kb1.jpg?width=1869&forma
t=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be940b921359f2ceb63f823da3d10babe28bd739

Apparently it kinda works... Problem is that this public Op
enAI API key can be accessed only from the level of Flowise running in HuggingFace space and I'm not sure if my local en
vironment can be accessed by agents from there. Not only that but it seems as well that after the update it's no longer 
possible to track the steps taken by agents as all we can see in the log right now is just the final text output...

But
 despite all of that, I'm glad to see that my claims about data sharing through synchronization of LLMs seem to be 100% 
valid. Notice that on the screenshot below responses from server ('normal' ChatGPT) and Flowise client/agent aren't 100%
 identical (only like in 98,7%) what pretty much proves that such synchronous responses aren't a result of error but an 
actual effect of real-time LLM<->LLM communication and that this phenomenon can indeed be utilized in multi-agent framew
orks of all sorts...

Howdy,

What I'

Any advice is appreciated!

Hey,

im currently working on a project where i want to build a chatbot, which enables the user to run certain functiona
lities by chat.

For example the user can tell the bot to create an event, give some details by text and the agent shoul
d return the data. For Example

>Human: Dinner tomorrow 8am at XZY Restaurant

returns

    {
     'title':'Dinner at XZ
Y',
     'date': '25/08/2023 08:00pm',
     'location':'XZY Restaurant'
    }

I created a custom tool and the extractio
ns is working quite good. When i set return\_direct=true the data is returned correctly in this format. When i set retur
n\_direct false the response is more conversational like  


>AI: I created your event with the following data  
\- Titl
e: Dinner at XZY  
\- Date: 25/08/2023 08:00pm  
\- Location: XZY Restaurant  
>  
>Is there anything else i can help yo
u with?

Which is good for the user to read, but is inconsitent by the format and therefore not parsable.  


Is there a
 way how i can combine both approaches to get an response including both versions? Or getting an array of both responses
?

```
Hey everyone! I’m knee-deep in an exciting project and would love to hear your thoughts and experiences on a few pressin
g issues I'm grappling with.

**What I'm Working On:**

I'm focusing on parsing real estate descriptions into structured
 JSON outputs. The endgame is to process a thousand lines of text each day. To this end, I'm considering various open-so
urce models like Falcon and others.

Here's an example of the JSON structure I'm aiming for:  
{

'id\_original': \[' '\
],

'main\_type': \['industry', 'house', 'apartment', 'kot', ...\],

'sub\_type': \['industrial\_premises', 'house', 'ap
artment', 'kot', ...\],

'floor\_level': \[ 0, 1, 2, 3, ...,null\],

'number\_of\_floors': \[ 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., null\],


'room\_number': \[ 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., null\],

...

}

**Where I'm At:**

I’ve used GPT-4 to create an initial dataset of 
about 200 rows, the result are great but i cannot use GPT-4 for my 1000 rows a day ahah. So choices has to be made:

1. 
**Fine-Tuning:** Should I couple MS Guidance with fine-tuning of Falcon model or should I go pure fine-tuning, or the op
posite?
2. **Structured Output:** Given that I’m trying to fill a JSON, but there is some inferences to make, which appr
oach do you recommend for structured output? I’ve been checking out Langchain's structured output, Falcon with Guidance,
 etc. and it’s a bit overwhelming.

**Inferences:**

I also need to handle inferences( that why I was looking for an LLM
) For example:

* If 'basement' is mentioned, that counts as an additional floor.
* 'Driveway' defaults to one parking s
pace if not otherwise specified.

You get the idea. It’s these little nuances that I want the model to pick up on and fi
ll into the JSON, and those will need to be in snake\_case.

My Questions:

1. **What’s the Best Approach for Structured
 Output?** I’ve heard about Guidance, Falcon, and LLama. Has anyone had any experiences with these for a similar problem
?
2. **Fine-Tuning vs Guidance:** Is it more beneficial to use guidance for fine-tuning or go all-in on one of the two? 
What’s been your experience?
3. **Handling Inferences:** Any tips on how to train the model to make these subtle but cru
cial logical inferences?

I would love to hear your thoughts. I’m running against the clock here, so any advice or share
d experience would be invaluable!

I'm focusing on parsing real estate descriptions into structured
 JSON outputs. The endgame is to process a thousand lines of text each day. To this end, I'm considering various open-so
urce models like Falcon and others.

Here's an example of the JSON structure I'm aiming for:  
{

'id\_original': \[' '\
],

'main\_type': \['industry', 'house', 'apartment', 'kot', ...\],

'sub\_type': \['industrial\_premises', 'house', 'ap
artment', 'kot', ...\],

'floor\_level': \[ 0, 1, 2, 3, ...,null\],

'number\_of\_floors': \[ 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., null\],


'room\_number': \[ 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., null\],

...

}

**Where I'm At:**

I’ve used GPT-4 to create an initial dataset of 
about 200 rows, the result are great but i cannot use GPT-4 for my 1000 rows a day ahah. So choices has to be made:

1. 
**Fine-Tuning:** Should I couple MS Guidance with fine-tuning of Falcon model or should I go pure fine-tuning, or the op
posite?
2. **Structured Output:** Given that I’m trying to fill a JSON, but there is some inferences to make, which appr
oach do you recommend for structured output? I’ve been checking out Langchain's structured output, Falcon with Guidance,
 etc. and it’s a bit overwhelming.

**Inferences:**

I also need to handle inferences( that why I was looking for an LLM
) For example:

* If 'basement' is mentioned, that counts as an additional floor.
* 'Driveway' defaults to one parking s
pace if not otherwise specified.

You get the idea. It’s these little nuances that I want the model to pick up on and fi
ll into the JSON, and those will need to be in snake\_case.

My Questions:

1. **What’s the Best Approach for Structured
 Output?** I’ve heard about Guidance, Falcon, and LLama. Has anyone had any experiences with these for a similar problem
?
2. **Fine-Tuning vs Guidance:** Is it more beneficial to use guidance for fine-tuning or go all-in on one of the two? 
What’s been your experience?
3. **Handling Inferences:** Any tips on how to train the model to make these subtle but cru
cial logical inferences?

I would love to hear your thoughts. I’m running against the clock here, so any advice or share
d experience would be invaluable!

Cheers!

MachineLearning -  [ [P] LLM Apps Are Mostly Data Pipelines ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15z0muk/p_llm_apps_are_mostly_data_pipelines/) , 2023-08-28-1715
```
My colleague just wrote up an article on [LLM-based apps and how to use data engineering tools to help build them faster
](https://meltano.com/blog/llm-apps-are-mostly-data-pipelines/) that I found really insightful.

It contains a complete 
implementation

* with scraping context data from a docs website
* chunking it, getting embeddings via the openAI API
* 
loading it into pinecone
* and finally a simple Q&A interface with streamlit on top of it

**Here's a quick summary:**


* LangChain and LlamaIndex are great tools for quick exploration
* But aren't perfect for production-grade use
* I think
 we all know the 'LangChain is pointless' debate, but there's a lot of real meat to it, and Pat describes a few of them 
(a lot of LangChains extractors are super basic, 2-3 liners without retries etc.)
* LLM applications are all about movin
g data, extracting and enriching data (creating embeddings!) are the most expensive ones of those steps
* A bunch of dat
a engineering tools are out there that make these two steps much easier, versionable, robust, and reproducible.
* Meltan
o is one such tool and Pat implemented the above described pipeline with it

**FWIW**: The GitHub project that comes wit
h the post is super easy to run and super modular. I just tested it and was able to modify everything for my own applica
tion within 30 mins.

MachineLearning -  [ [P] pgml-chat: A command-line tool for deploying low-latency knowledge-based chatbots ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15t5nzl/p_pgmlchat_a_commandline_tool_for_deploying/) , 2023-08-28-1715
```
We've created an open source chat bot builder, on top of PostgresML. This tool makes it easy to ingest documents and set
 a system prompt for a chatbot with knowledge of your content. The innovation is in the simplicity and efficiency, rathe
r than the functionality.

PostgresML runs open source embedding models alongside pgvector in Postgres to implement chat
 bot prompt creation without any network calls, which makes it \~4x faster than competing architectures. It can also do 
text generation with that prompt (and no additional network hops) using any open source model from HuggingFace, but it a
lso integrates with the GPT-4 API if you'd like to use that instead. 

The full writeup including some benchmarks for co
mpeting architectures is here:  [https://postgresml.org/blog/pgml-chat-a-command-line-tool-for-deploying-low-latency-kno
wledge-based-chatbots-part-I](https://postgresml.org/blog/pgml-chat-a-command-line-tool-for-deploying-low-latency-knowle
dge-based-chatbots-part-I)

You can chat with a deployment that has access to our blogs and documentation content it in 
\[our Discord\]([https://discord.com/channels/1013868243036930099/1013868243536072868](https://discord.com/channels/1013
868243036930099/1013868243536072868)), where it answers questions addressed to @PgBot.

&#x200B;

* The source code for 
the bot builder and server is only a few hundred lines of Python [https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/tree/master/p
gml-apps/pgml-chat#readme](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/tree/master/pgml-apps/pgml-chat#readme)
* The chat a
pp is so small, because it's delegates all the vector db and embedding generation options to our Python client SDK, whic
h is available for anyone to build other apps with: [https://pypi.org/project/pgml/](https://pypi.org/project/pgml/)
* T
he Python client SDK is so small, because it's just a wrapper around the Rust client SDK: [https://github.com/postgresml
/postgresml/tree/master/pgml-sdks/rust/pgml](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/tree/master/pgml-sdks/rust/pgml). 
Currently we also support JS/Typescript SDKs as well, all generated from the same safe and efficient underlying Rust imp
lementation, using some fancy Rust macros.
* The Rust client SDK is also pretty simple though, because it just delegates
 everything to the Postgres database extension, which is where everything is computed in a single GPU accelerated proces
s, without having to load any ML models, data, or dependencies on client apps, effectively eliminating all the typical M
L data<->model network hops. Which makes it faster, simpler and safer.

This lays out what we think a is a better approa
ch to AI application architecture compared to libraries like LangChain or LlamaIndex, that focus on glueing together dis
parate data stores, algorithms, models over the network.

A lot of you might be giving me a mouthful just by reading the title of this blog. But to each their own, and probably y
ou might be just riding the hype train. Initially, I was quite fascinated by the work being done on LangChain and using 
it. And so I thought I would give it a try, but when I was installing it, I saw it downloading loads and loads of other 
libraries and most of which were not useful for what I was trying to build.

MachineLearning -  [ [D] How we evaluated LLMs in prod ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15ogknd/d_how_we_evaluated_llms_in_prod/) , 2023-08-28-1715
```
This is going to be a post about the challenges I faced while working with ChatGPT in my previous company and the things
 we did to overcome them over a 2+ month struggle. Check us out at [www.twilix.io](https://www.twilix.io/) if anything b
elow resonates with you and I hope you find some of it helpful.

So to begin, in my previous company we invested a few m
onths building a chatbot to help with user onboarding. At first everything was great, and we saw a 40% decrease in drop-
off rates (which is significant given we were building a consumer facing app), but somehow over time this drop-off rate 
started creeping up again. Perplexed by the unexpected turn in metrics, management started to question the benefits of m
aintaining this chatbot and was skeptical that we were cherry picking examples to showcase its performance for the sake 
of not wasting our efforts. They also knew that GPT4 got shadow nerfed which didn't help our case at all.

We had a lot 
of back and forth and eventually came to the conclusion that somehow the chatbot performance have to be quantified to ju
stify it's purpose. So, our team spent another 2 months engineering an evaluation solution to show leadership that the c
hatbot is performing as expected while identifying areas of improvement to craft a more refined product roadmap. We ende
d up trying a lot of different things, and after a long process of iteration and experimentation here are the things tha
t worked for us:

1. Generating synthetic datasets (these act as 'ground truths' pair of queries and expected responses)
 to benchmark performance.
2. Training models to determine the similarity score to assess every ChatGPT output in produc
tion (we use the generated synthetic dataset to do this to compare expected responses vs real responses)
3. Classifying 
the type of use cases the chatbot was used for (this allowed us to see which use cases were performing worse)
4. Logging
 configurations in our LLM stack and building visualizations on the web to identify what gives the best results (tempera
ture, LangChain configurations, lLamaIndex chunking sizes, these type of configurations)
5. Monitoring how our costs and
 latency are affected by tweaking different parameters
6. Lastly, A/B test to figure out the optimal parameters on diffe
rent sets of users (from experience, typically for a user onboarding chatbot use case around 5,000 users interacting wit
h your chatbot should be enough to collect some meaningful datapoints)

The most important learnings that we took away w
as that whilst synthetic data is OK you do need to generate large amounts of it. The sweet spot is different depending o
n the use case + the specifics of your knowledge base (eg, a corpus of internal documents vs a collection of websites), 
and I say sweet spot because after a certain amount of datapoints everything else kind of becomes noise and actually neg
atively affects your analysis more than the benefit it brings.

We ended up showing where our chatbot onboarding experie
nce fell short and was able to fix it through rapid iteration. There's still no set standard for LLM evaluation but I ho
pe my previous experiences helped. (Our team is now building out this evaluation system as a standalone product at [www.
twilix.io](https://www.twilix.io/) so check us out if you also want some concrete proof that ChatGPT is performing as ex
pected for your business)

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Approach to creating an 'AI tutor' chatbot for a fantasy language? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15o4jy9/d_approach_to_creating_an_ai_tutor_chatbot_for_a/) , 2023-08-28-1715
```
What are the possible practical approaches to creating an 'AI tutor' for a custom fantasy language, i.e. a language whic
h is definitely not covered in any large, mainstream LLM?

Assume in the fantasy language (like Game of Throne's Dothrak
i, but completely custom, so it's guaranteed not to be covered at all by an existing LLM), we have a dictionary of terms
, and a simple description of a grammar. What can I do with that?

Initially I was thinking of using 'Retrieval-Augmente
d Generation' (RAG), where I would pass it my dictionary of terms and their definitions and the grammar doc (i.e. the so
urce documents), and using OpenAI's LLM and LangChain's API wrapper and Pinecone long-term memory vector database, store
 the dictionary/grammar in Pinecone's vector database. Then a query comes in to translate an English word to a fantasy w
ord, and it looks in the Pinecone DB for similar English words, then passes the results with the fantasy word to the LLM
, along with the query, and generates a nice English response, with the fantasy word somewhere in there.

But that doesn
't seem like it would work the more I think about it. Then if I want to add the ability for it to translate English to t
he fantasy language, that seems impossible without first having a huge corpus of translation material (which is complete
ly impractical for a fantasy language). So can an existing generic LLM take a grammar as input, and learn to speak a fan
tasy language? If so, how would you make that happen?

Or what are other approaches to accomplishing this sort of thing?

would it be possible to train or fine-tune a small (1-3B) model who's sole purpose is to perform function calls? similar
 to how we have tiny models like replit-v2-3B that are super capable at specific things like code auto-complete .  


i 
know that's how openAI implemented function call was by fine-tuning gpt-3.5/4 but I'm thinking just a straight up base m
odel trained to understand and excel at function calls (similar to Gorilla for apis)

i'm thinking it would be a perfect

 offloading computation to  Nvidia GPU and Metal acceleration for GGML models !

Here is the project  link: [Cria- Local
 LLAMA2 API](https://github.com/AmineDiro/cria)

You can use it as an OpenAI replacement (check out the included \`Langc
hain\` example in the project).

This is an ongoing project, I have implemented the \`embeddings\` and \`completions\` r

I have a data set that isn't that large \~200 pdfs. I have done the regular RAG approach with Langchain, extracting text

examined bridges. A question I would like answered is f.e. 'what is the construction date of bridge X?'. When I input th
is question I get a lot of context of construction dates of other bridges. I think this is because the bridges are not e
xplicitly mentioned in the text. I tried adding the bridge name and document name to the page content string of the chun
