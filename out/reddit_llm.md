It always seems odd to me that OpenAI doesn't use any chatbots on its site.  Do they not believe in their own product?


Especially for API users, a good chatbot with access to the docs is actually kind of useful.  Langchain does it with [ht
tps://chat.langchain.com/](https://chat.langchain.com/) and, while it's not perfect, I respect them for putting their mo
ney where their mouth is.  Why not OpenAI?

I’m wanting to apply result filtering for the retriever using value/s pas

Has anyone managed/ know how to use a placeholder approach (similar to langchains prompts ) which allows a valu

Open to any other filtering methods people have 
used!

NOTE: using the hybrid search type restricted the filter approach in as_retriever() method, but the hybrid perfor

```
I am working on my capstone project, where I developed a contract summarizer and a QA bot using the Llama 3 model and a 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. My dataset consists of contracts from 12 categories (e.g., shipping agreeme
nts, IP agreements), each with 5 PDFs. I need guidance on the following aspects of my journal article:

1. **Method Sele
ction**: Should I continue using the RAG approach, or are there alternative methods I should explore?
2. **Comparative A
nalysis**: To enhance the content of my paper, should I include a comparison of different methods, models, or approaches
? If so, what could I compare?
3. **Evaluation Without Ground Truth**: Since I don't have ground truth data, how can I e
ffectively evaluate my system? Should I use RAG-as-a-Service (RAGas) to generate a test set, or should I employ large la
nguage models (LLMs) as judges?
4. **Enhancing the Journal Article**: What additional components or methods can I incorp
orate to strengthen my paper and make it more comprehensive?
5. **Dataset and Ground Truth Suggestions**: Can you recomm
end other datasets that include ground truth for tasks like mine, or provide advice on how to generate ground truth data
 for evaluation?

I just want to know if my approach is correct. I have done enough research but my model keeps giving me whatever questio

1. Load the pdf document into langchain.
PDF is in format - q:
 and a:

2. Use 'sentence-transformer/all-MiniLM-L6-v2'  for embedding and chroma as vector store

3. Use 'meta-llama/Ll

4. Generate a pipeline and a prompt like 'Answer only from document. If not just say i do
n't know. Don't answer outside of document knowledge'

5. Finally use langchain to get top documents, pass the question 
and top docs as context to my llm and get response.

As said, the response is either repetirive or same as my question. 
Where am i going wrong?

```
Dear Developers,

I have created this repository to support your projects. This is not a product but a template that wil
l **ease your workflow**.

Here's the background:

While working on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project, I fo
und that no existing chat UI template offered all the features I needed. In response, I decided to build my own, incorpo
rating those missing functionalities.

Chatbot UI: [https://convo-ui.vercel.app](https://convo-ui.vercel.app)

Repositor
y: [https://github.com/RaghaRao314159/Convo-UI](https://github.com/RaghaRao314159/Convo-UI)

**Key features included in 
both ConvoUI and TurboGPT:**

1. **Multiple Chats/Conversations Support:** While Gradio is great, it only supports a sin
gle active conversation at a time. My template addresses this by storing multiple chats locally (via localStorage) and l
inking them to authentication keys.
2. **Authentication:** The template integrates authentication using OpenAI API keys 
for security and access control.
3. **Dark and Light Mode:** This feature can adapt to system settings or be manually to
ggled in the UI, providing flexibility in appearance.

**New features that I added:**

1. **Markdown Table Parsing and D
isplay:** Many existing chatbot UI templates struggle with cleanly rendering markdown tables, including TurboGPT. My ver
sion resolves this, ensuring tables display as neatly as they do in OpenAI's UI.
2. **Custom Backend Model Integration:*
* Most chatbot UIs lack the ability to interact with custom backend models, as these typically require different object 
classes for communication compared to standard API calls. My template includes examples for calling backend models using
 Flask and Langserve. You can test this by selecting a backend model. Click to visit the [Backend Repo](https://github.c
om/RaghaRao314159/Convo-UI_backend).
3. **Streaming Chatbot Outputs:** While streaming outputs is straightforward with f
oundation models, it becomes complex when dealing with backend servers. After extensive testing, I successfully implemen
ted streaming capabilities for backend models in this template. Unfortunately, pythonanywhere voids this and my backend 
is currently on pythonanywhere. I will move it to another server in due time.



***I hope this template helps you accel
erate the development of your full-stack applications.***

-------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------

**More resources on building chatbots**

I have thoroughly explored various approaches to 
building a fully custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM chatbot, and the results of my work can be found in my 
[RAG repository](https://github.com/RaghaRao314159/AuditBot_backend). Unlike many other online resources, this repositor
y offers a complete full-stack solution for developing a RAG chatbot.

**For Frontend Developers:**

I have included mul
tiple UI options, from simple mockups to production-grade interfaces, along with the necessary code to integrate the fro
ntend with the backend. The chat interface is a React application, similar to this one, utilizing LangServe. You can fin
d the frontend code in the [AuditBot repository](https://github.com/RaghaRao314159/AuditBot_frontend).

**For Machine Le
arning Engineers:**

I have conducted extensive experiments to improve the RAG framework, covering techniques such as Hy
DE, recursive retrieval, and others. Additionally, the repository provides implementations of frameworks like Langchain 
and LlamaIndex. It also includes setups for data stores, examples of prompt engineering with GuardRails, and much more. 
 
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
**Feedback**

Do let
 me know if you would like to see other additional features would be useful in a chatbot UI.

I have a background in time-series analysis and I work for a small company (read: startup) that works on GenAI. As part 
of that, my manager has asked me to produce ASAP a proof-of-concept implementation of an AI agent on large document reco
gnition ASAP - specifically, we have a meeting with a client wanting a PoC of an AI agent that you can ask questions to 
about a corpus of text that the client uploads.

Specifically, my manager has asked me to look into performing OCR on a 
large document (~200 pages) and uploading it into a Chroma vector store, and implementing a question-answer system with 
an AI agent that performs semantic understanding for the client to use. I'm going to be burning the midnight oil for the
 next few days so I'd like some advice on how to get started. Are there any tutorials or resources that I can deal with?

I've tried the following code on two separate machines and it does not seem to run. However, If I load the model directl
y into ```node-llama-cpp```(which langchainjs depends on) it works fine. I'm thinking something is fundamentally broken 
within Langchain for Javascript.

let llamaPath = '../project/data/llm-models/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B-Q4_K_M.gguf'

const question = 'Where do Llamas
 come from?';


if (fs.existsSync(llamaPath)) {
  console.log(`Model found at ${llamaPath}`);

  const model = new Llama
Cpp({ modelPath: llamaPath});

  console.log(`You: ${question}`);
  const response = await model.invoke(question);
  con
sole.log(`AI : ${response}`);
} else {
  console.error(`Model not found at ${llamaPath}`);
}
```

Hey everyone!



I'm working on an agentic app where:



- Queries related to table data should be handled by a SQL agen
t.

- For other queries, it should switch to a normal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using a local vectorstore.




I'm using the LangGraph framework to create conditional edges, allowing dynamic routing based on user query types. Anyo
ne have tips on structuring the conditions and integrating both vectorstores and SQL agents seamlessly?

Hello,

I am working with a custom OpenAI deployment in Azure. I am able to connect with openAI libraries and retrieve d
ata properly, but when trying with langchain, response generated are mostly gibberish.

for example:  
a simple hello wo
rld, is printing all this:
```
llm.invoke('hello world!')

' this is a test';\\nconsole.log(s);\\nvar l = s.split(' ');\
\nconsole.log(l);\\n\`\`\`\\n#### 2. 代码测试\\n\\n直接在控制台运行即可，结果如下：\\n\\n!\[数组\](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload\_ima

Hello Community,
I am looking to build out micro-saas out of RAG by combining both Software Engineering and AI principle
s. I have actually build out the version 1 of backend, with following features.

Features:
- SSO login
- Permission base
d access control on data and quering
- Support for multiple data connectors like drive, dropbox, confluence, s3, gcp, et
c
- Incremental indexing
- Plug and play components for different parsers, dataloaders, retrievers, query mechanisms, et
c
- Single Gateway for your open and closed source models, embeddings, rerankers with rate limiting and token limiting.

- Audit Trails
- Open Telemetry for prompt logging, llm cost, vector db performance and gpu metrics

More features comin
g soon…

Most importantly everything is built asynchronous, without heavy libraries like langchain or llamaindex. I am l
ooking for community feedback to understand will these features be good for any business? If at all, is anyone intereste
d to collaborate either in help secure funding, frontend work, help me get connected with other folks, etc? 
Thank you!

```
I’m one of the cofounders of [Doctly.ai](http://doctly.ai/), and I want to share our story. Doctly wasn’t originally mea
nt to be a PDF-to-Markdown parser—we started by trying to feed complex PDFs into AI systems. One of the first natural st
eps in many AI workflows is converting PDFs to either markdown or JSON. However, after testing all the available solutio
ns (both proprietary and open-source), we realized none could handle the task without producing tons of errors, especial
ly with complex PDFs and scanned documents. So, we decided to tackle this problem ourselves and built Doctly. While our 
parser isn’t perfect, it far outpaces most others and excels at parsing text, tables, figures, and charts from PDFs with
 high precision.While no solution is perfect, Doctly is leagues ahead of the competition when it comes to precision. Our
 AI-driven parser excels at extracting text, tables, figures, and charts from even the most challenging PDFs. Doctly’s i
ntelligent routing automatically selects the ideal model for each page, whether it’s simple text or a complex multi-colu
mn layout, ensuring high accuracy with every document.  
With our API and Python SDK, it’s incredibly easy to integrate 
Doctly into your workflow. And as a thank-you for checking us out, we’re offering free credits so you can experience the
 difference for yourself. Head over to[ ](https://doctly.ai/)[Doctly.ai](http://doctly.ai/), sign up, and see how it can
 transform your document processing!

**API Documentation:** To get started with Doctly, you’ll first need to create an 
account on[ ](https://doctly.ai/)[Doctly.ai](http://doctly.ai/). Once you’ve signed up, you can generate an API key to s
tart using our SDK or API. If you’d like to explore the API without setting up a key right away, you can also log in wit
h your username and password to try it out directly. Just head to the[ Doctly API Docs](https://api.doctly.ai/docs), cli

all -  [ LLM Pipelines on Frontend for Full Stack? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1g6jv1b/llm_pipelines_on_frontend_for_full_stack/) , 2024-10-21-0913
```
I came to the LLM space from a data science background, so I've always had a belief that anything ML related is better d
one in python. Over the past few months I've been building full stack apps that all look something like this:

* vue.js 
frontend, hosted on vercel
* python flask backend, hosted separately on vercel serverless (same repo different deploymen
t, if that makes sens)
* The frontend gets some data from the user, makes a call to the backend to run some complex LLM 
pipeline that takes \~20 seconds, and displays the response.

The better I get at dealing with javascript and its unhing
ed ecosystem, the more I realize that I might not need the backend at all. Moreover, **I'd be able to display intermedia
te progress and steps while the user waits for the call to be completed**.

It feels like blasphemy, but I'm probably go
ing to start building out the LLM pipelines in javascript and calling the model APIs directly from the frontend. Managin
g the communication between the backend and frontend in a serverless environment has been a major pain in the ass and go
ing full js feels like the right move.

Has anyone gone through something similar? Anything tips or things to look out f
or would be greatly appreciated!

```
Hey!

Just like the title says, I've tested and published videos and posts about these frameworks. Today, I want to shar
e my **high-level view** about each framework and which could be the most suitable for your use case.

You can [find the
 \~8 min video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/2F-z9s4wgwk), but here's the gist of it:

**AutoGen**

AutoGen shines when i
t comes to autonomous code generation. Agents can self-correct, re-write, execute, and produce impressive code, especial
ly when it comes to solving programming challenges

**crewAI**

If you’re looking to get started quickly, CrewAI is prob
ably the easiest. Great documentation, tons of examples, and a solid community.

**LangGraph**

LangGraph, to me, offers
 more control and I feel that it's best suited for more complicated workflows, especially if you need Retrieval-Augmente
d Generation (RAG) or are juggling multiple tools and scenarios.

**OpenAI Swarm**

OpenAI just released Swarm a few day
s ago and I’m still testing it, but as they’ve said, it’s experimental. It's the simplest, cleanest, and most lightweigh
t of the bunch—but that also means it comes with the most limitations. It’s not ready for production use; it’s more for 
prototyping. Things could change quickly, though, since this space moves fast.

I hope you find this useful.

Cheers!

I am working on a RAG question and answer system consisting of 2 .py files. The first .py loads a PDF document, does tex
t chunking and embedding and saves it to disk using Faiss. The second .py file loads the locally stored vector index, do
es a similarity search, takes the user query and generates an answer using open source LLM. The two are run in sequence.


I noticed that reloading the stored embedding vectors is very time consuming. The similarity search has always been fa

So I built this tool that aut

MachineLearning -  [ [D] How are folks building conversational Retrieval Augmented Generation apps ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ftdby7/d_how_are_folks_building_conversational_retrieval/) , 2024-10-21-0913
```
I've read through various resources such as:  
- [https://vectorize.io/how-i-finally-got-agentic-rag-to-work-right/](htt
ps://vectorize.io/how-i-finally-got-agentic-rag-to-work-right/)  
- [https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/qa\_cha
t\_history/](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history/)  
- [https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph
/tutorials/rag/langgraph\_agentic\_rag/](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/rag/langgraph_agentic_rag/) 
 
- [https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module\_guides/deploying/chat\_engines/](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/
module_guides/deploying/chat_engines/)  
- [https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/ChatRAG-Bench](https://huggingface.co
/datasets/nvidia/ChatRAG-Bench) 

But these feel overly reductive, since they don't address complexities like:  
1) when
 to retrieve vs. just respond immediately to reduce latency  
2) rely on existing context previously retrieved in the co
nversation instead of retrieving again at the current turn  
3) partition LLM context between retrieved information and 
past conversation history.

I'm sure some teams already have good systems for this, would appreciate pointers!

MachineLearning -  [ Built a web agent which call fill Google forms based on the user details [P] ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fozud5/built_a_web_agent_which_call_fill_google_forms/) , 2024-10-21-0913
```
GitHub repo : [https://github.com/shaRk-033/web-agent](https://github.com/shaRk-033/web-agent)

Tried to solve it using 
two approaches:

# 1: Basic Scraping and Filling

This is the straightforward approach. The agent scrapes the form’s HTM
L and uses fixed XPaths to find and fill in the required fields.

* It pulls the form’s HTML, locates the fields with se
t XPaths, and inputs the answers. It’s a direct and simple method.
* If the form changes or an element isn’t where it’s 
expected, the process can fail and may need manual adjustments.

[basic approach](https://preview.redd.it/5e8g4a1k4xqd1.

2. Using LangChain Agents and tool call
ing

* LangChain Agent**:** The agent handles everything by using the LLM’s reasoning to decide what to do next, includi
ng generating those tricky XPaths.
* Error Handling**:** If something goes wrong (like an element not found), the agent 
tries again with better XPaths until it gets the job done.

Any recommendations to improve this w
ould be welcome. Also, if anyone has ideas on building similar web agents to automate other tasks, it would be great to 
hear them. :)
