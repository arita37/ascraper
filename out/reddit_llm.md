I'm trying to use an an agent in a router chain for a chatbot I'm developing. looking at the logs it looks like the rout
er selects the agent and passes it everything properly and the agent runs just fine. But at the parse step it fails beca
use there's no key 'text', which makes no sense to me. Any advice? Has anyone been able to do this successfully?

Hi, I'm new to this so I may be doing this wrong but on the Windows  11 version of H2OGPT I can upload my documents and 
create a collection in LangChain Mode-Path. However whenever I restart the documents disappear. 

This is a pain as I am
 trying to analyse my own documents. I've clicked on 'Update DB with new/changed files on disc'.

Also does it matter if
 I add documents before or after I load a model? I've tried it with no model and with a model loaded.

Speaking of which
 is it possible to set a default model using the one-click installer of H2OGPT?

all -  [ Chain Conversations for Context ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/16fyrje/chain_conversations_for_context/) , 2023-09-12-0909
```
**Tl;Dr:**If you have an idea that you need assistance in its creation; try using a 'Master' chat, and use only refined 
and condensed information from 'sub-chats' as its input to ensure you get the most contextual reply. This method reduces
 the amount of prompt engineering required at various stages of the chat, ie; the beginning/ middle/ end. Responses are 
more contextual, and there is a perceived compounding affect within the original model context window where replies are 
very good even when compared against advanced prompting techniques.---

Background:I've been using ChatGPT everyday sinc
e its inception. Over the past year, I've envisioned an assistant language model of my own for fun. With the help of Ope
nAI I've been able to achieve this at an advanced level, and there's been a poignant observation that has helped me real
ly develop this application (more than just creating a model, but also training, advanced nlp, vectorstores, tokens, emb
eddings/ embeddings models... it was a lot, I promise):

The issue:Using ChatGPT, you have a limited context window. Reg
ardless of the size of this window (it's not infinite), you will begin to have degrading quality replies at some point. 
Even with advanced gradient descent techniques, from what I've observed, you still sacrifice context as the conversation
 is lengthened. This issue is poignant when developing large code-bases, as eventually the code slowly becomes less and 
less compatible on the first try, or the use of advanced prompt techniques for later in the conversation are required (a
nd not guaranteed). But this is universally true if the conversation you're having requires specific context throughout 
its history.

My observed solution to maintain context without prompt engineering:Structure your chats so that the infor
mation you abstract during your conversation can be pulled in a formatted way, and then inserted into a 'Master' chain. 
The idea is, if you have a large conceptual idea, it's likely that it will require branches of thought to be unified at 
some point in order to replicate the big-picture idea; ie: for what you want to see to actually happen. In that sense, y
ou need to structure your responses so that when one branch is completed- you can copy/paste that information in its ful
l context back into your master chat branch. The idea is to shove as much context as possible into one single chat. It's
 best to have a unified context repository. A single chat container which contains only information with as much rich co
ntext as possible. Use multiple other chats to refine your ideas, condense the logic, and create a dense conversation ra
ther than a long one where useless embeddings are stealing context later in the chat.

Why it works:In the practice of r
efining your idea, you allow the nlp model to curate its own definitions and language. By the time you've refined your i
dea, you've basically let the model use its own parameters to curate suitable verbose (its own language with underlying 
context) that enhances the quality of the response when used as the input in your Master chat. This is a simple concept,
 but imo one of the most important distinctions of why this method is important.

Simple Example:i. I want to create an 
application that converts my pdf to tokens and embeddings.ii. To do this, I might ask ChatGPT, 'how can i do this', and 
use its response as my individual chat windows. So, it might say, okay you need to transform the data to CSV, use nltk t
o tokenize the data, use openai for the embeddings, and then you might want to explore the data- is there anything furth
er you'd like to discuss.... etc. etc.'iii. so, now my chat windows become; a. transform pdf to csv, b. nltk for tokeniz
ing csv data, c. openai for embeddings, d. exploring embedding data. from there, I'd ask questions to the chat window un
til I felt comfortable about how that specific step is achieved.\*I constantly ask ChatGPT to think critically, think an
alytically, and provide your response in a step by step format where each individual step is in succession of the previo
us step and forms a logical pattern. *something like that*I. Master Chat: includes the answers to my questions from the 
individual sub-chats.II. I'm updating my Master-Chat as new information is presented that contributes to a condensed sol
ution. \*the Master-Chat is still very conversational, although now it's a bit more intentional with its results. imo th
is creates a compounding effect in which the more dense the information provided, the longer lasting the context as the 
conversation continues. The answers you receive within the first context window (4k/ 8k/ 16k/ 32k, wtv.) will be vastly 
superior. This is easier than prompt engineering, it's simply organizing the information in a better way.

Final Tip:You
 can further refine the context of your discussions with ChatGPT, by simply using the instructions in your settings.i. W
hat would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses? 'Hi G, my name is 'x', and I'm working on the 
following project: '.ii. How would you like ChatGPT to respond? 'Just be your normal, helpful, self. Thank you. I love y
ou.'

Disclaimer: I understand the underlying technology is more complicated than the suggested advice implies, and in p
ractice may operate differently, albeit come to the same conclusion imo. This is practical advice. I just see so much no
nsense about 'prompt-engineering' and the reality is, while important, it's not the end-all. And, you can use simpler pr
ompting techniques like asking the chat for step-step replies, which are providing contextually rich information that ca
n be used to create better conversations in new chats.

I thought this was interesting, especially if new Users are havi
ng trouble with the context window, plus all the talk about degrading replies. This is just one way to combat that.

```
I am creating a Document based Query/Answer application on my corporate machine. It is unable to get local issuer certif
icate, thus I am unable to use most of the LLMs that have been provided since most of them download the model when calle
d. So essentially, no API calls allowed.

As of right now, I am using GPT4All local model and the sentence transformer a
ll-MiniLM-L6-v2 for embeddings. But this combination is way too slow when querying. Do you guys have any other suggestio
ns and combinations? When suggesting, please keep in mind the problem I mentioned lol. 

Thank you so much.

```
Hey Reddit,

I'm working on a tool to pull data from highly irregular Excel files. I've gotten reasonable results which 
is extremely fast with standard Python coding, but it's far from perfect due to the lack of standardized templates. 

In
terestingly, when I tested ChatGPT-4 on a sample table, it did a decent job at data extraction. However, relying solely 
on GPT-4 has its downsides like token limits and slow processing speed (and data privacy issues). Plus, splitting the Ex
cel sheet to fit within these limits results in loss of context and data.

I'm considering fine-tuning a language model 
to post-process data that was in a Pandas DataFrame (perhaps converted to JSON). Has anyone had success with this approa
ch or have alternative recommendations? I've tried Langchain, but it wasn't helpful.

I have figured out to extract the 
relevant columns, but the post-processing part is where I am considering using an LLM which understands the domain and w
hat needs to be extracted based on the examples I feed it.

Looking forward to your thoughts! And would be happy to answ
er any additional questions.

```
Hello fellow LangChainers,

I'm leveraging FAISS for my vector store and I'm curious about the optimal query length to r
etrieve pertinent documents. My goal is to develop an app that succinctly summarizes business reports tailored to specif
ic roles within a company. For instance, imagine a Head of Finance who prefers a concise overview rather than reading an
 entire report.

To form my query, I've been incorporating the job responsibilities of the target persona. However, I'm 
concerned that my query might be too extensive, leading to less relevant results.   


**Query** (that goes into FAISS v
ia similarity\_search\_with\_score method):

    
Based on the target persona's responsibilities, extract insights from 
a company's annual report.
    Target Persona: Head of Finance, a key figure in the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), who
 emphasizes financial reporting, risk management, and compliance. They play a crucial role in guiding the company's fina
ncial direction, ensuring adherence to regulations, and building relationships with external entities.
    Key Responsib
ilities:
    Overseeing organizational financial reporting, encompassing monthly summaries, budget projections, long-ter
m financial plans, and mandatory reports.
    Offering robust financial guidance to the ELT for informed business decisi
ons.
    Presenting financial outcomes and insights to the Board.
    Central to shaping the company's strategy.
    Sup
ervising the company's tax matters, collaborating with external tax consultants when needed.
    Managing company cash f
low and implementing appropriate treasury controls.

**Given the above, any insights on how I can optimize my query for 
better results in FAISS would be greatly appreciated!**

Hi there, this question is not going to be highly technical, but I'm rather seeking some guidance from more experienced 
developers regarding to career decisions.  


I started learning code roughly 6 months ago after I quit my COO role at s
tart up. Long story short today, I am able to launch a full stack application, I know how Client/Server Components work,
 I understand API, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Auth, OpenAI, Langchain Functions, Streaming etc. etc. etc.  


This is the a
pp that roughly present my skills: [copycopter.ai](https://copycopter.ai) 

&#x200B;

**Now the problem is, I don't real
ly know what to do next.**  
My dream would be learn further and build more, so that at some point, I can make money fro
m my own things. For now, however, I struggle to find people interested in my SaaS, so I probably have some work to do i
n terms of 'go to market' and 'PMF'.  


I could look for a job as a developer, but the only thing I know is NextJS App 
Router and I feel like I'm not yet ready to get a reasonably paid job as a dev. On the other hand, I see so many people 
that create much worse products yet they openly talk about the readiness to get employed.  


I have a lot of experience
 in no code, process automation, Zappier, operations management etc. so I could bring good value to any startup.   


**
What would you do if you were me?** I'm kina struggling to find the right path now.  
**What to learn next? What kind of
 jobs should I seek for?**

```
I've just started with LLMs and LangChain, but I really need some help to understand the key concepts around RAG. I've r
ead it reduces the risk of hallucinations using your data, so I've been trying to build a basic prototype myself. I've e
nded up copying the code from [https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/ollama](https://python.langchain.com/
docs/integrations/llms/ollama), this is what I've got:

    llm = Ollama(
     base_url='http://localhost:11434',
     m
odel='llama2',
     callback_manager=CallbackManager([StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()]),
      )
    
    loader = WebB
aseLoader('https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/')
    data = loader.load()
    text_splitter = Recursive
CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=100, chunk_overlap=50)
    all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data)
    
    
 
   vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(
     documents=all_splits, embedding=HuggingFaceEmbeddings()
     )
    
    fro
m langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
    prompt_template = '''Use the following pieces of context to answer the que
stion at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer. Only use p
rovided context, don't try to generate an answer based on assumptions.
    
    {context}

    QA_CHAIN_PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
        template=prompt_template, input_variables=['context

    )
    
    chain_type_kwargs = {'prompt': QA_CHAIN_PROMPT}
    qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type
(
            llm,
            retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(),
            chain_type_kwargs={'prompt': QA_CHAIN_P
ROMPT}
    )
    
    question = 'What are the various approaches to Task Decomposition for AI Agents?'
    result = qa_
chain({'query': question})

After unsuccessful experiments I even use the original web source and the question from the 
example in the documentation. But the output is rather disappointing (lots of hallucinations, perhaps coming from pre-tr
aining datasets, no information coming from the linked web page): 

>Based on the provided context, there are several ap
proaches to task decomposition for AI agents. Here are some of them:

tioned in the context, the agent can use language models (LLMs) with simple prompts like 'Steps for XYZ.' or 'What are t

>2. Goal-based decomposition: The agent can de
compose a task into smaller subgoals based on its goals. For example, if the goal is to make a cup of coffee, the subgoa
ls could be 'obtain coffee beans,' 'boil water,' 'use coffee filter,' etc.  
>  
>3. Workflow-based decomposition: The a
gent can decompose a task into smaller subgoals based on a workflow or a series of steps involved in completing the task
. For example, if the task is to organize a trip, the subgoals could be 'book flight tickets,' 'make hotel reservations,
' 'plan itinerary,' etc.  
>  
>4. Hybrid approach: The agent can use a combination of goal-based and workflow-based dec
omposition to break down large tasks into smaller subgoals. For example, the agent can use goals to determine the overal
l task and then break it down into smaller subgoals based on a workflow.  
>  
>5. Machine learning-based approaches: Th
ere are various machine learning-based approaches to task decomposition, such as using neural networks to learn patterns
 in data or using reinforcement learning to learn how to break down tasks into smaller subgoals.

&#x200B;

I'm lost at 
this point, I thought using retriever=vectorstore.as\_retriever(), should have enforced using the source and only it as 
the context? Is there a mistake in the code or am I misunderstanding how it should work?

Thanks in advance for any advice!  


I'm applying for A) product manager, and B) product marketing manager jobs. (Somet
imes 'Senior' level, sometimes not). I have generally worked in 'tech' over my previous recent roles, but my experience 
is kind of a grab bag.  


I'm definitely stretching my qualifications a bit to land a tech PM/PMM role. Worth noting th
at I've done a lot of projects involving AI recently because that's a particular area of interest and often where I'm ap
plying.  


Issues I know I have to overcome:  


* Weird / small companies on my resume. I've started a couple companie
s and my recent work experiences aren't at 'known' companies. 
* I come off too senior (?). Since I've founded a couple 
companies, I have things like 'CEO' on my resume. But of a 15 person company... Nonetheless, I've been told before that 
hiring managers were worried I wouldn't be 'satisfied with the level of responsibility in this role.'
* I'm currently un
employed. I tried to remedy this by (truthfully) saying I've been doing self employed work. However, I don't know if I'm
 describing this correctly or whether it's even helpful to have that on here.

My main questions are:

&#x200B;

1. Are 
there any noticeable things I might consider changing to address the issues outlined above? (Or other issues you perceiv
e?)
2. Should I have an Overview section at all? What about the self employed Experience?  


Thanks again!

```
I am unsure if this is the right sub to ask such a question I'll try my best to provide as much context of my issue.

I 
am currently a IT Researcher looking at using RAG Models for document question and answering. I am working with Multiple
 500+ Page documents filled with charts, numbers, and text. We use these documents to record and track information in sp
readsheets. The current workflow is using a small team to go through the documents manually looking for the information 
they need to record in their sheets. The documents are too big to use a Ctrl + F keyword search so I was looking at RAG 
Models to make searching through these documents more effective.

I have been using ThirdAI's Pocket LLM (open to try al
ternative or open source RAG Models) to try to test the effectiveness of such a strategy but I have had issues properly 
prompting/searching for what I want. I have no problem building my own RAG Model using langchain I am just wondering if 
this is the best route for such an issue. Data privacy is not a concern because the documents we will be using are publi
cly available information. Data accuracy however is pretty important so I was wondering if hallucination is a factor whe
n dealing with RAG models.

It's fine if embeddings are expensive. Automating this process is far more valuable. Thanks 
for any insight or feedback and I will be happy to clarify anything just ask.

Hey y'all,

I wanted to put my ReAct agent on Streamlit. Thank you for the recommendations, btw, that was exactly what I
 was looking for.

The problem that I have is that the agent pipes the feedback into the shell but not the screen. Docum
entation doesn't really help.

Here is my agent definition

    llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model_name='gpt-3.5-turb
o')
    tools = load_tools(['human', 'serpapi', 'llm-math'], llm=llm)
    
    prefix = '''Some agent definition.
      
          Ask appropriate questions. 
                You have access to the following tools:'''
    suffix = '''Begin!'

    
    {chat_history}
    Question: {input}
    {agent_scratchpad}'''
    
    output_parser = CustomOutputParser()
 
   prompt = ZeroShotAgent.create_prompt(
        tools,
        prefix=prefix,
        suffix=suffix,
        input_vari
ables=['input', 'chat_history', 'agent_scratchpad'],
    )
    memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key='chat_histor
y')
    llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)
    agent = ZeroShotAgent(llm_chain=llm_chain, tools=tools, verbose
=True, output_parser=output_parser)
    agent_chain = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(
        agent=agent, tools=too
ls, verbose=True, memory=memory
    )

Here is the streamlit part

    if prompt := st.chat_input('What is up?'):
      
  st.session_state.messages.append({'role': 'user', 'content': prompt})
        with st.chat_message('user'):
          
  st.markdown(prompt)
    
        with st.chat_message('assistant'):
            message_placeholder = st.empty()
     
       full_response = ''
            for response in agent_chain.run(st.session_state.messages):
                full_r
esponse += response.choices[0].delta.get('content', '')
                message_placeholder.markdown(full_response + '▌'
)
            message_placeholder.markdown(full_response)
        st.session_state.messages.append({'role': 'assistant',
 'content': full_response})

What I want is that if the app queries 'human' it should pop the question to the chat inter
face.

I think there's a lot of confusion around AI agents today and it's mainly because of lack of definition and using the wr

We've been talking to many companies who are claiming they're working on agents but when you look unde
r the hood, they are really just chains.

I just listened to the Latent Space pod with Harrison Chase (Founder of Langch
ain) and I really liked how he thinks about chains vs agents.

Chains: sequence of tasks in a more rigid order, where yo
u have more control, more predictability.  
Agents: handling the edge-cases, the long-tail of things that can happen.

A
nd the most important thing is that it's not an OR question but an AND one: you can use them in the same application by 
starting with chains -> figuring our the edge-cases -> using agents to deal with them.

starting with chains -> figuring our the edge-cases -> using agents to deal with them.

```
We're building a fast low latency Graph Database called FalkorDB that will also support Vector search.  
It's based on R
edis and can be used both as a stand alone database or a module for existing Redis.  
It feels like that is going to be 
the most optimized way to serve Knowledge as RAG, would love to get your feedback.

db](https://github.com/FalkorDB/falkordb)  


It already supports LlamIndex and Langchain:

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Is there anything LangChain can do better than using LLMs directly (either through a website or  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/165airj/d_is_there_anything_langchain_can_do_better_than/) , 2023-09-12-0909

I haven't used ChatGPT a lot or any other LLMs, I've been reading about  Langchain and its use cases, and I'm having tro
uble wrapping my head  around exactly what it does. From what I understand, its an alternative  interface for LLMs, allo
wing for easy switching between them, and makes  some work for specific use cases easier. If I wanted to write an app or
  script to interact with LLMs and do other tasks, how would LangChain be  better than just making API call(s) to an LLM
, getting back the result  as a string, and doing whatever with it?

I’m looking for recommendations, suggestions, and/or good documentation that outlines which data pipeline would be best 
to ingest my private data (which will then be split into chunks/nodes for vector embeddings and so forth). Thank you in

MachineLearning -  [ [P] LLM Apps Are Mostly Data Pipelines ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15z0muk/p_llm_apps_are_mostly_data_pipelines/) , 2023-09-12-0909
```
My colleague just wrote up an article on [LLM-based apps and how to use data engineering tools to help build them faster
](https://meltano.com/blog/llm-apps-are-mostly-data-pipelines/) that I found really insightful.

It contains a complete 
implementation

* with scraping context data from a docs website
* chunking it, getting embeddings via the openAI API
* 
loading it into pinecone
* and finally a simple Q&A interface with streamlit on top of it

**Here's a quick summary:**


* LangChain and LlamaIndex are great tools for quick exploration
* But aren't perfect for production-grade use
* I think
 we all know the 'LangChain is pointless' debate, but there's a lot of real meat to it, and Pat describes a few of them 
(a lot of LangChains extractors are super basic, 2-3 liners without retries etc.)
* LLM applications are all about movin
g data, extracting and enriching data (creating embeddings!) are the most expensive ones of those steps
* A bunch of dat
a engineering tools are out there that make these two steps much easier, versionable, robust, and reproducible.
* Meltan
o is one such tool and Pat implemented the above described pipeline with it

**FWIW**: The GitHub project that comes wit
h the post is super easy to run and super modular. I just tested it and was able to modify everything for my own applica
tion within 30 mins.

MachineLearning -  [ [P] pgml-chat: A command-line tool for deploying low-latency knowledge-based chatbots ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15t5nzl/p_pgmlchat_a_commandline_tool_for_deploying/) , 2023-09-12-0909
```
We've created an open source chat bot builder, on top of PostgresML. This tool makes it easy to ingest documents and set
 a system prompt for a chatbot with knowledge of your content. The innovation is in the simplicity and efficiency, rathe
r than the functionality.

PostgresML runs open source embedding models alongside pgvector in Postgres to implement chat
 bot prompt creation without any network calls, which makes it \~4x faster than competing architectures. It can also do 
text generation with that prompt (and no additional network hops) using any open source model from HuggingFace, but it a
lso integrates with the GPT-4 API if you'd like to use that instead. 

The full writeup including some benchmarks for co
mpeting architectures is here:  [https://postgresml.org/blog/pgml-chat-a-command-line-tool-for-deploying-low-latency-kno
wledge-based-chatbots-part-I](https://postgresml.org/blog/pgml-chat-a-command-line-tool-for-deploying-low-latency-knowle
dge-based-chatbots-part-I)

You can chat with a deployment that has access to our blogs and documentation content it in 
\[our Discord\]([https://discord.com/channels/1013868243036930099/1013868243536072868](https://discord.com/channels/1013
868243036930099/1013868243536072868)), where it answers questions addressed to @PgBot.

* The source code for 
the bot builder and server is only a few hundred lines of Python [https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/tree/master/p
gml-apps/pgml-chat#readme](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/tree/master/pgml-apps/pgml-chat#readme)
* The chat a
pp is so small, because it's delegates all the vector db and embedding generation options to our Python client SDK, whic
h is available for anyone to build other apps with: [https://pypi.org/project/pgml/](https://pypi.org/project/pgml/)
* T
he Python client SDK is so small, because it's just a wrapper around the Rust client SDK: [https://github.com/postgresml
/postgresml/tree/master/pgml-sdks/rust/pgml](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/tree/master/pgml-sdks/rust/pgml). 
Currently we also support JS/Typescript SDKs as well, all generated from the same safe and efficient underlying Rust imp
lementation, using some fancy Rust macros.
* The Rust client SDK is also pretty simple though, because it just delegates
 everything to the Postgres database extension, which is where everything is computed in a single GPU accelerated proces
s, without having to load any ML models, data, or dependencies on client apps, effectively eliminating all the typical M
L data<->model network hops. Which makes it faster, simpler and safer.

This lays out what we think a is a better approa
ch to AI application architecture compared to libraries like LangChain or LlamaIndex, that focus on glueing together dis
parate data stores, algorithms, models over the network.

A lot of you might be giving me a mouthful just by reading the title of this blog. But to each their own, and probably y
ou might be just riding the hype train. Initially, I was quite fascinated by the work being done on LangChain and using 
it. And so I thought I would give it a try, but when I was installing it, I saw it downloading loads and loads of other 
libraries and most of which were not useful for what I was trying to build.

```
Hey folks,

I've been digging everywhere, including here, for LLMs and custom applications. So, I read many things, lear
ned from ppl here. Its time to try something. I will try implement Llama v2 - Langchain - Chroma combination. But also I
 want to upload a dataset so that I can try my model on that. 

I find some datasets big enough (for now, 2-5 gb is ok) 
however they are table-style. I want something more texty, I mean I could use 'American Stories' or 'Arxiv' however I be
lieve that they are already used by Llama to train. 

&#x200B;

Is there any suggestions or sources that you can provide
 ? Thanks!
