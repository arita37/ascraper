Many youtube videos demonstrate RAG. Here are two examples:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jENqvjpkwmw](https://www.y
outube.com/watch?v=jENqvjpkwmw)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lig9c7OkxTI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lig9c7Okx
TI)

These tutorials typically show the following process: Custom data (e.g. PDFs converted to text) is loaded using Lan
gchain. The texts are split into chunks, often with overlaps. Embeddings are generated using the nomic-embed-text model.
 These embeddings are stored as a vector database in ChromaDB. The system retrieves relevant information from the vector
 database based on the user's query.

These demonstrations usually run in the Python interpreter or Jupyter notebooks. M
y question: Is it possible to combine this process with Ollama and OpenWebUI? Specifically, I'd like to create the vecto
r database once and update it regularly (e.g. weekly) with new data. I want to use this vector database by default with 
every prompt in Ollama/OpenWebUI. Is such a setup feasible? If so, how could it be implemented? I envision creating the 
vector database manually, then showing Ollama where it's located. After that, Ollama would automatically use this vector
 database for every prompt.

I understand that in Ollama/OpenWebUI, one can click on the Documents button and select fil
es. However, my scenario involves a large number of diverse files, with new ones being added weekly. Therefore, it would
 be more efficient to have a vector database that can be continuously updated.

1. Monitor a GitHub repository for new PRs  
2. Perform a code review on e

3. Post a summary of the review to a Slack channel

**Comparison**

* **AutoGen vs LangChain**: AutoGen excels 
in multi-agent conversations, while LangChain offers a broader toolkit for LLM applications. AutoGen required less boile
rplate for complex agent interactions in my projects.
* **AutoGen vs CrewAI**: AutoGen allows for more flexible, dynamic
 agent interactions. CrewAI is better suited for projects with predefined roles and structured workflows.
* **AutoGen vs
 LlamaIndex**: AutoGen focuses on agent interactions, while LlamaIndex specializes in data ingestion and retrieval. They
 can complement each other well in data-heavy projects.
* **AutoGen vs OpenAI library**: AutoGen provides a higher-level
 abstraction for multi-agent systems, simplifying the process compared to directly using theopenai library

```
Was writing some code that wanted to print the model string for a model without having a specific model.
Unfortunately, 
`BaseChatModel` does not have a `model` property.
Tried the set of alternatives used in my code at present, `Union[ChatO
penAI, ChatLiteLLM, ChatAnthropic]` and `ChatOpenAI` has no `model` property.
This kind of thing hurts langchain's abili
ty to paper over the differences between LLMs, which is its key strength.

I suggest a refactoring that promotes `model`
 up to the `BaseChatModel` and does something about `model` vs. `model_name` to make the latter both clearer in terms of
 its meaning (or simply an alias to the former, as it is in `ChatAnthropic` (see below). The following in `ChatLiteLLM` 
is not at all helpful:

    model_name: Optional[str] = None
    '''Model name to use.'''

As opposed to model name not 
to use?

`ChatAnthropic`:

    model: str = Field(alias='model_name')

It's ok if `model_name` is just and alias for bac
kwards compatibility, but on `ChatLiteLLM` the fact that it's `Optional` means that it might not be defined, which foils
 that purpose.

This seems like something that should be very easy to do, but I'm stu

I suppose I can just smash together the system prompt string and the Prompt string and then make a single temp
late, but it seems wrong that we have these classes that can't be composed.  Seems like adding a `Message` to a `PromptT

I already developed a saas for serving agentic RAG to multiple custom

However, I'm developing a new application for agentic document analysis an

For the first project, I really wanted to learn a framework th
at was 'broadly' used, but now I want the agent to 'just work' and follow the steps in the process, and 'normal' if/else
 chains coupled with 'clever' prompting seem to work without getting into any of the intricacies of Langchain/LangGraph.


So, what do you think are the REAL advantages of using LangGraph?

Hello, Im developing a OpenAi + langchain application.

I've noticed that response quality is much worse when I deploy t

Things like returning links dont work cor
rectly on the cloud and the answers give more errors in general.

Example of 1 simple question.

Question: Do you have M
eta Lava gloves?

Local (Correct Result): I recommend the Lava Meta gloves for $750. You can find them at this link: [ht
tps://gloves.com/shop/meta/lava-meta-flat/](https://gloves.com/shop/meta/lava-meta-flat/).

AWS US (wrong URL): The Meta
 Lava gloves are priced at $750. You can find them at this link: gloves.com/producto/meta-lava

GCP Chile (wrong URL): T
he Meta Lava gloves are priced at $750. You can find them at this link

Its not an issue with determination since respon
ses on local and cloud are very consistent. Im pretty sure everything else is exactly the same like temperature, api key
s, etc. I thought it could be an issue with jurisdiction but its the same no mater the cloud provider or region.

```
The most important thing to build great RAG system is 'building great RAG evaluation dataset'.

Why?

Like all other ML 
systems out there, there are no silver bullet in the RAG field.  Some techinques can be great on some documents, but it 
can be terrible on the other dataset.

[Experiment on the different dataset \(done by me\)](https://preview.redd.it/4igy
mtmlmg9d1.png?width=2964&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5801d1e3b401bceafe8fca97048f91d4f313cf3)

The performance of BM25 was g
reat on the financial document, but it was terrible at the college rulebook document. It is one of the example that RAG 
performance can be very different when the document is different.

So, how to find the great RAG module for **your docum
ent**?

Of course, start making great RAG evaluation dataset. 

I think the great RAG dataset must be realistic. It is a
lways better to gather real user's question. If you can't try to mock their question.   
Plus, it have to be precise. Wr
ong ground truth answer or wrong retrieval ground truth is bad for the result.  
And, do not believe LLM. LLM, even gpt-
4o or claude-3 opus, is quite dumb to make 'natural and realistic' question from the given passages. 

You don't have to
 make thousands of questions. A hundred questions will be enough.

After making great RAG evaluation dataset, the 90% of
 your work is done. You can use AutoML tools like [AutoRAG](https://github.com/Marker-Inc-Korea/AutoRAG/) to optimize RA
G using your dataset. You can get high performance RAG in a few hours. For do that, you have to make great RAG evaluatio
n dataset with much more time.

Actually, I am the builder of AutoRAG and there is an youtube video that I explain about
 AutoRAG. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2WR9p1yS7Y) to watch that.

```
New to local LLMs, so apologies in advance if this question doesn't quite make sense.  
Trying to migrate a very simple 
python app that analyzes spreadsheets to a local LLM  - works fine with:

* ChatOpenAI imported from langchain\_openai
*
 create\_pandas\_dataframe\_agent imported from langchain\_experimental.agents.agent\_toolkits

But when I use llama-cpp
-python to reference llama.cpp, all hell breaks loose.

* Is llama-cpp-python not ready for prime time?
* Is there a bet
ter alternative to access a local LLM that works with create\_pandas\_dataframe\_agent?

thx in advance!

```
I'm curious about how I might go about creating the chatgpt experience, which combines chat and the ability to write and
 execute python code. 

I know I could do this with yne Assistants API. And I know I could do this with Langchain. 

How
 could I do it with vanilla agents? Like if I used Open Interpreter as the code part, I don't know how to combine it wit
h chat abilities so that the agent 'knows' to chat if it needs to chat and to use code if it needs to code (e.g. Create 
a chart from data). 

Could a vanilla agent setup be used in such a way as a backend for a chat application?

Hi,

I am using the mixtral 8x7b instruct model where function calling generally is not possible as of my knowledge. But
 I built a Langgraph pipeline where I am using the Mixtral 8x7b model and for classifying a user question the model shou
ld return boolean values (True or False).

  
Is Mixtral capable of this? When I tested it out, it sometimes worked but 
often times it did not. I am using the model with the Groq Api and it could well be that the error is on the api

My company has a large library of 200ish page documents that we frequently create for project proposals. Creating these 
documents is very laborious and so is searching for information in them. I was advised to turn those documents into vect
or embeddings, load those embeddings into embeddings index or db, then do Retrieval Augmented Generation over those docu
ments using langchain.

I am curious if this process is possible to do entirely locally because of the sensitive nature 
of the documents and if so what tools to use? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Hi all,

Soo, i have been working on a a projectcalled [GenAI Job Fit](https://github.com/DAVEinside/GenAI_Job_Fit). It'
s an AI-driven system designed to enhance job applications by providing tailored recommendations based on individual pro
files.

I'm relatively new to LangChain and LangGraph, and I've incorporated them into this project. I would greatly app
reciate it if you could check out the repository and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Your insights
 on how I can better implement LangChain/LangGraph, or any other aspect of the project, would be incredibly valuable. I'
m eager to learn and make this project as robust as possible.

Thank you in advance for your time and feedback!

```
[https://github.com/piEsposito/tiny-ai-client](https://github.com/piEsposito/tiny-ai-client)

The motivation for buildin
g tiny-ai-client comes from a frustration with Langchain, that became bloated, hard to use and poorly documented - and t
akes inspiraton from [simpleaichat](https://github.com/minimaxir/simpleaichat/tree/main), but adds support to vision, to
ols and more LLM providers aside from OpenAI (Gemini, Anthropic - with Groq and Mistral on the pipeline.)

I'm building 
this to to continue what simpleaichat started and not to ride on hype, raise money or whatever, but to help people do 2 
things: build AI apps as easily as possible and switching LLMs without needing to use Langchain.

This is a minimally vi
able version of the package, with support to vision, tools and async calls. There are a lot of improvements to be done, 
but even at its current state, tiny-ai-client has generally improved my interactions with LLMs and has been used in prod
uction with success.

Let me know what you think: there are still a few bugs that may need fixing, but all the examples 
work and are easy to be be adapted to your use case.
