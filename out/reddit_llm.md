```
When a user uploads a doc, it chunks, embeds, then persists it. This currently takes 25 seconds with multithreading on 6
 cores for me. The chunk size is small (250), so there's a lot to process. I need this to be faster, and I need to add s
upport for concurrent file uploads.

Here's my current setup:

embeddings: openai small embedding model (batch embed)

c
hunking: langchain recursive text chunker (250 chunk size)

persistence: Mongodb vector store (batch persist)   
  
I se
e several companies online seemingly able to upload & embed my same 200 page document in 6 seconds (chatgpt), and in par
allel so i'm wondering if i'm missing something that everyone else is using. What tools libraries/tools do you guys use 
to have fast chunking, embedding, & persistence?

My current idea is to achieve fast parallel uploads via a separate AWS
 lambda invocation per upload, and have a high amount of cores per lambda so we can achieve paralell processing of chunk
s in the lambda. Thoughts/advice?

all -  [ Introducing Cascade of Semantically Integrated Layers (CaSIL): An Absurdly Over-Engineered Thought/R ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gi102k/introducing_cascade_of_semantically_integrated/) , 2024-11-03-0914
```
So here’s a fun one. Imagine layering so much semantic analysis onto a single question that it practically gets therapy.
 That’s CaSIL – Cascade of Semantically Integrated Layers. It’s a ridiculous (but actually effective) pure Python algori
thm designed to take any user input, break it down across multiple layers, and rebuild it into a nuanced response that e
ven makes sense to a human.

I have been interested in and experimenting with all the reasoning/agent approaches lately 
which got me thinking of how I could add my 2 cents of ideas, mainly around the concept of layers that waterfall into ea
ch other and the extracted relationships of the input.

The whole thing operates without any agent frameworks like LangC
hain or CrewAI—just straight-up Python and math. And the best part? CaSIL can handle any LLM, transforming it from a “ye
s/no” bot to something that digs deep, makes connections, and understands broader context.

How it works (briefly):

1. 
Initial Understanding: Extract basic concepts from the input.


2. Relationship Analysis: Find and connect related conce
pts (because why not build a tiny knowledge graph along the way).


3. Context Integration: Add historical and contextua
l knowledge to give that extra layer of depth.


4. Response Synthesis: Put it all together into a response that doesn’t
 feel like a Google result from 2004.


The crazy part? It actually works. Check out the pure algo implementation with t
he repo. No fancy dependencies,, and it’s easy to integrate with whatever LLM you’re using.

https://github.com/severian
42/Cascade-of-Semantically-Integrated-Layers


EDIT FOR CLARITY!!! 

Sorry everyone, I posted this and then fell asleep 
after a long week of work. I'll clarify some things from the comments here.

1. What is this? What are you claiming?: Th
is is just an experiment that actually worked and is interesting to use. I by no means am saying I have the 'secret sauc
e' or rivals o1. My algorithm is just a really interesting way of having LLM s 'think' through stuff in a non-traditiona
l way. Benchmarks so far have been hit or miss

2. Does it work? Is the code crap?: it does work! And yes, the code is u
gly. I created this in 2 days with the help of Claude while working my day job.
 

3. No paper? Fake paper?: There is no
 official paper but there is the random one in the repo. What is that? Well, part of my new workflow I was testing that 
helped start this codebase. Part of this project was to eventually showcase how I built an agent based workflow that all
ows me to take an idea, have a semi-decent/random 'research' paper written by those agents. I then take that and run it 
into another agent team that translates it into a starting code base for me to see if I can actually get working. This o
ne did.


4. Examples?: There is an example in the repo but I will try and put together some more definitive and useful.
 For now, take a look at the repo and give it a shot. Easy set up for the most part. Will make a UI also for those non c
oders 


Sorry if it seemed like I was trying to make great claims. Not at all, just showing some interesting new algori
thms for LLM inference

Hello everyone, I'm pretty new to langchain & langraph assuming that I want to build pizza ordering bot which would talk
 to the customers, sample bellow: 

**Bot** : Hi, how can I help you ?  
**Human**: I would like to buy a pepperoni  
**
Bot:** Sure something else ?   
**Human:** I would like to ask is diavola spicy ?  
**Bot:** Yes, the diavola is spicy  
?   
**Human**: Okay, I would like one diavola as well with some extra basil .  
**Bot :** <conclude the order and confi
rm it> 

I'm trying to achieve something similar in a more complex context, but the problem I face cannot keep a consist
ent context, e.g. It could add diavola with details but remove pepperoni, or keep diavola without extra details. 

  
I 
would like to ask if someone faced something similar, how do you handle this problem, maybe there is some useful tools w
hich, I'm not aware of ? 

Thanks

```
Hi,

I am using [ChatMistralAI](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/mistralai/) and [FastAPI](https://fa
stapi.tiangolo.com/) with the Python client and I am scratching my head on how to enable streaming successfully with Mis
tral Large. I am battling a lot of 422 and trying to find out what the issue is in the request I am sending. Since ChatM
istralAI should act as a wrapper and it abstracts away the details of constructing requests directly to the API, making 
it easier to use without needing to build raw HTTP requests. Therefore, my first attempt was this:

`from fastapi import
 FastAPI, HTTPException`

`from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse`

`from langchain.chat_models import ChatMist
ral`

`from pydantic import BaseModel`

`app = FastAPI()`

`class Question(BaseModel):`

`text: str`

`temperature: floa
t = 0.7`

`max_new_tokens: int = 100`

`\@app.post('/code-generation') # corrected @ symbol`

`async def code_generation
(question: Question):`

`mistral_api_key = 'YOUR_MISTRAL_API_KEY'`

`# Initialize ChatMistral with streaming enabled`

`
chat_mistral = ChatMistral(`

`api_key=mistral_api_key,`

`model='mistral-large', # specify the model variant`

`tempera
ture=question.temperature,`

`max_tokens=question.max_new_tokens`

`)`

`async def stream_response():`

`try:`

`async f
or token in chat_mistral.chat_stream(messages=question.text):`

`yield token['choices'][0]['delta']['content']`

`except
 Exception as e:`

`raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))`

`return StreamingResponse(stream_response(), m
edia_type='text/plain')`

However, I don't seem to get it right as I am banging my head with 422 errors that I cannot cl
early debug. I took a different approach, but still with no joy and using directly the `'https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/
completions' endpoint, as follows:`

`from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException`

`from fastapi.responses import Stream
ingResponse`

`import requests`

`import json`

`app = FastAPI()`

`mistral_api_key = 'YOUR_MISTRAL_API_KEY'`

u/app`.po
st('/code-generation')`

`async def code_generation(question: Question):`

`headers = {`

`'Authorization': f'Bearer {mi
stral_api_key}',`

`'Content-Type': 'application/json',`

`'Accept': 'application/json',`

`}`

`payload = {`

`'model':
 'mistral-large', # whatever model ID`

`'temperature': question.temperature,`

`'max_tokens': question.max_new_tokens,`


`'stream': True,`

`'messages': question.text`

`}`

`def mistral_endpoint(headers, payload):`

`try:`

`response = re
quests.post(`

`'https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/completions',`

`headers=headers,`

`json=payload,`

`stream=True`

`)`


`response.raise_for_status() # Raises an error for non-200 responses`

`for line in response.iter_lines():`

`if line a
nd line != b'data: [DONE]':`

`json_data = json.loads(line.decode('utf-8').replace('data: ', ''))`

`yield json_data['ch
oices'][0]['delta']['content']`

`except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:`

`raise HTTPException(status_code=5
00, detail=f'Error communicating with Mistral API: {e}')`

`return StreamingResponse(mistral_endpoint(headers, payload),
 media_type='text/plain')`

What is the correct way to enable streaming for a Mistral Large model? Do you directly use t
he `chat/completions` endpoint? What is exactly the payload I need to construct? What am I missing?

Thanks

```
**Has anyone else been frustated writing and debugging langchain code?** There are so many classes and abstractions that
 don't seem to add much value. As a result, what really happens behind the curtains feel quite opaque. For me having low
-level control is very important. 

So I just published this open-source framework [**GenSphere**](https://github.com/oc
topus2023-inc/gensphere)**.** You build LLM applications with yaml files, that define an execution graph. Nodes can be e
ither LLM API calls, regular function executions or other graphs themselves. Because you can nest graphs easily, buildin
g complex applications is not an issue, but at the same time you don't lose control. 

There is also this Hub that you c
an push and pull projects from, so it becomes easy to share what you build and leverage from the community.

Its all ope
n-source. Would love to get your thoughts. Pls reach out or join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/DZFWMXJv) if yo

```
Has anyone experimented with creating a planner agent that dynamically creates graphs to carry out complex tasks?  
I've
 built an agentic framework from scratch where each agents each hold specific personas and sets of tools and collaborate
 in a centralized conversation with the user.  
Each message received by an agent triggers an sort of 'internal monologu
e' which implements the ReAct framework.

But I've noticed that without clear directions, planning, and tasks assignment
s, the agent team really struggles to carry out complex tasks.

So I was thinking: it'd be great to implement a sort of 
plan-execute pattern with a planning agent. Ideally it would even create a LangGraph Graph.  
Models would even be train
ed on planning, kind of like how o1-preview has been trained on chain of thoughts.

Any thoughts? Anyone has experimente
d with this?  
Cheers!

```
I know this is langchain subreddit but thought to discuss here as most agent developers are there..

I have been playing
 with autogen for few hours to understand.
I immediately felt two needs,
Suppose there are two agents, writer and review
er. 
The termination condition is when reviewer gives it rating of 8 or more.
My need is execution of certain functions 
when this terminal condition is met, currently what i found is only way is custom implementation.
Second, 
For human in 
the loop, I don't want my user to enter prompt via terminal, I need it to be through WhatsApp message or some slack inte
gration. How do I do this?

Suggestions are welcomed. Or any other framework with these features..

all -  [ Integrating External REST API LLM Calls with LangGraph ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1ghc5pg/integrating_external_rest_api_llm_calls_with/) , 2024-11-03-0914
```

I'm working on implementing an agent system using LangGraph, but with a twist - my LLM calls need to go through a REST 
API service instead of using direct LLM integrations.

- Using LangGraph for agent orchestration
- Need to make LLM call
s via REST API endpoints
- Looking to build a custom agent that works with this architecture

1. Is it possible to integ
rate external REST API calls for LLM interactions within the LangGraph framework?
2. Are there any examples or best prac
tices for creating custom agents that use HTTP requests instead of direct LLM integrations?
3. What would be the recomme
nded approach to handle asynchronous REST API calls in this context?

## Technical Details Needed
- Best way to wrap RES
T API calls within LangGraph's expected interfaces
- How to handle authentication and session management
- Proper error 
handling and retry mechanisms
- State management considerations

Any guidance, examples, or pointers to relevant documen
tation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

all -  [ Fuzzy matching medical terminology using AI ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ghb3ei/fuzzy_matching_medical_terminology_using_ai/) , 2024-11-03-0914
```
Have a txt file with 2 columns, description and corresponding code. Need help intelligently matching user inputted free-
form text to the description, and returning the corresponding code.



Background:

I am building a medical pricing webs
ite. The user inputs free form text (à la Google) describing the condition and receives pricing at local hospitals.

Med
ical billing is a labyrinth, separated into inpatient and outpatient services and diagnosis codes. A diagnosis code (ICD
10) will usually translate into an inpatient code (DRG), but not always. Other times, ICD10 codes will translate to the 
wrong DRG code. 

I have been using a forward searching approach, searching first for the ICD10 code and translating it 
to a DRG. As an example, a search for 'heart transplant' yields the ICD10 code Z94.1 which corresponds to DRGs 314-316 (
'Other Circulatory System Diagnoses'). In fact, DRGs 001 and 002 ('Heart Transplant') are more correct, but do not have 
a corresponding ICD10 code. 

[CMS.gov](http://CMS.gov) has appendices that list exactly which ICD10 corresponds with wh
ich DRG as well as DRG numbers and descriptions. Not all DRGs have a corresponding ICD10 code, so **I will have to match
 the user-inputted free form text to DRGs directly.**



Things I have explored:

String matching using Jaccard Distance
/ Levenshtein Distance/ Jaro-Winkler: not the best since most laypeople will not know the exact medical terminology ('sn
oring' symptom vs 'sleep apnea' medical term)

Zero-shot approach with Gemini and OpenAI. Both AIs will hallucinate and 
return the wrong DRGs. 

* Fine tuning: OpenAI, Gemini, and Llama3.2 both require a question and answer dataset, best if
 50 examples per classification (DRG code). This is... not easy and probably not going to be very accurate. Hard to gues
s what a user might input in free form text.
* Corpus of documents for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): LangChain V
ectara, Gemini, Vertex AI for RAG: This is a promising option but examples on the [Vectara](https://python.langchain.com
/v0.1/docs/integrations/providers/vectara/vectara_summary/) site show that this approach is better for summarizing, or r
etrieving relevant 'chunks', than strict regurgitation.
* Vertex AI for tabular data: similar challenges with providing 
examples for fine tuning
* QLoRA/ LoRA: probably much more technically oriented and more than I need, also increased har
dware requirements.

Giving OpenAI/ Gemini a complete list of all the DRG descriptions with each prompt, asking the AI t
o match with the appropriate entry. This would use a large number of tokens ($) for every prompt. Is there a way to keep
 this in memory? Is that what the Corpus is? If I provide a text file as a document in the Corpus, is the AI smart enoug
h to match the user input to the DRG description in the file and return the corresponding DRG code in the file in a diff
erent column?

```
Basically the title. I am experimenting the \`with\_structured\_output\` and I find that the llm uses the variable name 
to know what to populate. 

`phrases_with_dumb: list[str]`

I thought the pydantic's Field description would affect the 
behavior too, but seems like it's not affecting how the model generates the data. 

`phrases: list[str] = Field(descript
ion='list of phrases with the word dumb')`

So should I assume that Field description is not used when the model generat
es the data?

I am a software engineer with 5+ years of experience and decent experience with LangChain. Over the past week, I am buil
ding a stock analyst agent on LangGraph, and the experience has been terrible.

The documentation and tutorials make me 
feel dumb, even simple tasks seem unnecessarily difficult, which has left me frustrated. I’ve decided not to proceed wit
h LangGraph for the time being,I just can’t imagine using it to build 10-20 more nodes.

Is there an alternative on the 
market today that any of you are using? Ideally, something in async Python.

all -  [ Is this possible? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1ggqtad/is_this_possible/) , 2024-11-03-0914
```
I have a JSON dataset of the format:
[
{
key1: val1,
key2: val2,
key3: val3,
...
}
{
key1: val1,
key2: val2,
key3: val3

...
}
...
]

There is data in one key which relates to another one.

Is it possible to build a RAG chatbot, in such a wa
y that it accepts dynamic inputs and gives answers based on the key.

[1] For instance, let's say key1 is dog and key2 i
s cat, the rag chatbot should detect from the chat input if it contains cat or dog and should return  the value based on
 the key. If the chat message contains anything related to dog in it, it should return the answer from the dog key else 
if the message has anything related to catch in it, it should return from the cat key.

[2] The RAG model should also ge
nerate outcome based on the following scenario: let's say if the value4 and value5 depends on what is given in value3.


[3]Another case is, value5 and value6 are numbers. The chatbot RAG should make sure it provides information in such a wa
y that if the user mentions any number and the number is in between value5 and value6, it should return the output from 
value4 or value5 based on the logic in point [1]


Could you guys please let me know if this is possible, cause i couldn
't find any example over the internet.

Is there a good certification to do specifically for GenAI on AWS? I'm more interested in leveraging GenAI tools and not
 on the usual route of ML sagemaker models etc.

If not, what other certifications do you recommend tailored for GenAI? 
I'm right now working with OpenAI and want to go deeper into aspects of finetuning, perhaps may langchain etc. 

Sorry, 
just posting a long question, but my intent is to get a certification while also working on my startup idea. Right now, 
I'm mostly doing prompt engineering and some AWS plumbing and hence finding ways of expanding my horizons.

all -  [ Jupyter not honoring Conda environments? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/JupyterNotebooks/comments/1ggmaty/jupyter_not_honoring_conda_environments/) , 2024-11-03-0914
```
Hi all!

I've been using jupyter on an off for a while, but I need to start using it a lot more regularly, and I need to
 integrate with conda virtual environments.

Working on a new ubuntu 24.04 install, I installed Anaconda, then created a
 new virtual environment and installed jupyter:

    conda create -n jupyter python=3.12
    conda activate jupyter
    
pip install jupyterlab
    jupyter lab
    ... 

So far so good, everything running as expected. So I then create anothe
r conda environment for a new project and register it with jupyter via ipykernel.

    conda create -n rag-llama3.2 pyth
on=3.11
    conda activate rag-llama3.2
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=rag-llama3.2

The ipykernel part w
as completely new to me, I was following a medium post: [https://medium.com/@nrk25693/how-to-add-your-conda-environment-
to-your-jupyter-notebook-in-just-4-steps-abeab8b8d084](https://medium.com/@nrk25693/how-to-add-your-conda-environment-to
-your-jupyter-notebook-in-just-4-steps-abeab8b8d084)

So I now have jupyter running in its own conda env, and a new env 
to use for my project. This is where things get very strange. I jump in to the jupyter console, create a new notebook, a
nd select the newly registered kernel from the dropdown, all seems fine. I start installing a few packages and writing a
 little code:

    ! pip install langchain-nomic
    ! pip install -qU langchain-ollama
    ! pip list | grep langchain

    langchain-core            0.3.14
    langchain-nomic           0.1.3
    langchain-ollama          0.2.0

Packages i
nstalled, so I begin with an import:

    # LLM using local Ollama
    
    ### LLM
    from langchain_ollama import Cha
tOllama
    
    local_llm = 'llama3.2:3b-instruct-fp16'

So the modules are installed, but I can't import them. At this point I
 started hunting around and found a few commands to help identify the problem:

    !jupyter kernelspec list --json

      }
    }
    
    !which -a python
    /home/gjws/anaconda3/envs/jupyter/b
in/python

So to my untrained eyes, jupyter is seeing both the jupyter conda environment and the rag-llama3.2 environmen
t and getting confused.

Now I don't know where to go.

Have I done something fundamentally wrong?

Should I NOT be runn
ing jupyter in its own venv and just install it globally?

Have I screwed up the ipykernel steps somewhere?

Any help wo
uld be much appreciated. I've been at this for hours and have hit a brick wall :(

Thanks for taking the time to read al
l this!!!

I prefer the short one, because I pu

Any opinions?

```
Hey devs!

A few months ago, I was searching everywhere for a voice chatbot framework to use with Flutter, especially af
ter discovering that Langchain had been ported to Flutter. My goal was to create a **mindful self-compassion assistant f
or kids**, but I couldn’t find any ready-made solution for the setup I had in mind. So, I decided to build my own and th
en to open source it, this is a story behind **FlutterVoiceFriend**!

**FlutterVoiceFriend is far from perfect, but I be
lieve it can help others get started on their voice chatbot journey.**

👉 [GitHub Repo: FlutterVoiceFriend](https://gith
ub.com/jbpassot/flutter_voice_friend/)

# What is FlutterVoiceFriend?

It’s an open-source Flutter app framework that co
mbines **Langchain, OpenAI for TTS/NLP**, and multiple Speech-to-Text (STT) options (including Deepgram for online and o
ffline STT) to create **interactive, voice-driven chatbots**.

# Why it Might Be Helpful 🚀:

Whether you’re working on a
 virtual assistant, educational companion, or a voice-driven game, FlutterVoiceFriend gives you a flexible starting poin
t to create voice-based applications that are **fully customizable** and cross-platform.

# Key Features:

* **Voice-to-
Voice Conversations**: Speak with the bot and get natural voice responses!
* **Multiple Speech Recognition Options**: Bo
th on-device and cloud STT, making it versatile for different environments and device capabilities.
* **Natural Language
 Processing**: Langchain + OpenAI models for creating more natural, nuanced dialogues.
* **Customizable TTS**: Set up di
fferent voices and languages to give your chatbot a unique “personality.”
* **Built with Flutter**: Compatible across iO
S, Android, and Web platforms from a single codebase.

# The App That Started It All:

Here’s the app I originally built
 using this framework – [The Friend In Me](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-friend-in-me/id6605936938), a mindfulness c
ompanion for kids.

# Looking for Contributors!

If you’re interested in building out features, writing tests, optimizin
g for different use cases, or just want to contribute ideas, I’d love for you to get involved. Whether you’re a Flutter 
guru or just excited to work with voice/chatbot tech, let’s make this better together!

# Happy coding! 😊

```
Hey everyone!

I’m exploring options for a production-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setup to generate JSON 
data from documents. My goal is to get **accurate, commercial-ready outputs** as quickly as possible. I’m open to models
, as long as the results are reliable and production-suited. After some research and help from GPT, I’ve narrowed down t
o a few options and would appreciate insights or any advice based on experience.

# Current Options Considered GPT table

https://preview.redd.it/azd7m59yg3yd1.png?width=899&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dd00c476aceeef1ddd56aa7ba0a3709c9bcf54a

Key
 Priorities:

* **Accuracy and production-readiness** for JSON outputs.
* **Commercial use** licensing and support.
* **
Ease of scaling and deployment** for enterprise production (though I’m flexible on initial setup time if results are sol
id).
* I could pay

AWS Bedrock seem like the best path for this, or would something else better fit my needs? Does anyo
ne have experience with Bedrock in a production RAG workflow, or should I be looking deeper into SageMaker or an open-so
urce alternative?

It seems that Haystack would be nice for production, customization and then putting it on the cloud b
ut with a bit more time investment.

Hi All,

Been dabbing at Ollama to create a custom RAG hosted in local server (for security reasons). Now the client wan
ts a Chain of Thought (COT) capability as well. Basically the client wants basic numerical functionality. For e.g. 'I am
 doing 80 mph on I 80. What is the average speed here and how much slower or faster I am'.

The data has details about a
vg speed of I80. example 90 mph. So the RAG application should say 'I am 10mph slower than average speed.'

Are there an
y COT capable Local LLMs? If not any idea how to solve the above problem?
