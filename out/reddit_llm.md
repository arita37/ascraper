I was running through what I thought would be a simple tutorial: [https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/chatb
ot/](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/chatbot/), but am having some trouble that seems to indicate they 
have removed a module referenced in the tutorial.

In the section on managing history [https://python.langchain.com/v0.2
/docs/tutorials/chatbot/#managing-conversation-history](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/tutorials/chatbot/#managi
ng-conversation-history) we are supposed to use this 'trim\_messages' module.  I tried importing as in

>from langchain\
_core.messages import SystemMessage, trim\_messages

and got 

    cannot import name 'trim_messages' from 'langchain_co
re.messages'

. Diving into the API documentation, I noticed that the 'trim\_messages' package doesn't exist.

[https://
api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/core\_api\_reference.html#module-langchain\_core.messages](https://api.python.langcha
in.com/en/latest/core_api_reference.html#module-langchain_core.messages)

This seems like a pretty obvious mistake so I 
assume I'm doing something wrong.   Have any of you got trim\_messages to work? Any help would be appreciated.

I just want to ask if someone is already using LangChain in production, which basically means that during the developmen
t process, nothing could stop you from deploying and maintaining it.

I always assumed that LangChain is a project suita
ble for academic projects and/or beginners as a good starting point. And now, since I also suggested it to our team, two
 colleagues are against Langchain because they share the same assumption with me and still stick with it.

I am asking h

Recently I built a chatbot with OpenAI Assistant API. Its doing what we require it to do which brought me to thinking wh
ats the point of langchain or maybe I dont understand it well.

For example, I have custom knowledge base, I upload it t
o OpenAI Vector Store, connect it to my Assistant and I have a chatbot. Where does langchain come in this?

Or if I uplo
ad my knowledge base to any vector database for example, Pinecone, then connect it with OpenAI API, I'd still get a chat
bot.

Please help me understand langchain on a deeper level.

Would really appreciate this.

Hi, I'm new to autogen, so far I've managed to make a human-agent interaction

I also made a groupchat with a manager, b
ut all the agents are talking between them and it is not what I am looking for

I need to create a structure where there
 is a manager and there are other two agents, one of them handles DnD information and the other Pathfinder, this an exam
ple, what each agent does is more complex but it is easier to just start with some agents handling certain types of info
rmation

basically if the human writes, the manager will evaluate which agent is better suited to handle whatever the hu
man is inquiring, the human can continue having a chat with the agent, maybe if it is something better suited for the ot
her agent then it will switch to that one

is there a way to accomplish this? the groupchat with the manager seemed prom

3. JSON mode and structured data best practices?

  
About my

1. I'm using gpt-4o and have had pretty good results.  
2. small maybe 5-10 seems to work reliably but more

```
Google just announced Context Caching in the Gemini API — it allows you to store and reuse input tokens for repetitive r
equests.

Many LLM tasks have extensive system prompts laying down instructions and initial context.

If these are cache
d, they wouldn’t have to be encoded all over again every time, saving on costs and latency.

Tokens are cached for a spe
cified duration (TTL), after which they are automatically deleted.

Costs depend on the number of tokens cached and thei
r storage duration, and efficiency would be higher for prompts with context used across many LLM calls.

Determine:   

1.Whether or not the user is in a meeting(use the

the user is in a meeting, else if the current time is before the start time of all meetings or after the end time of all

Summarise your findings.   

<|eot\_id|>

This is just one of many prompts that i've given to llama3. In each o
f them, it always gets it wrong for certain timings.

Hi,

  
I developed a RAG bot with an in memory store (e.g. last three messages are getting saved). Now I was wondering 
how I can apply my RAG pipeline to follow-up questions.

  
See this example:

**User:** Where is the football EM 2024?


**Bot:** The EM 2024 is in Germany. (works fine until here)

**User**: Thanks, and which nations will participate? (fol
low up question)

  
With this follow up question I see the difficulty to find relevant Information, as without context,
 it is not clear that the follow up question is about the Euros 2024. The 'correct' question where my Bot will find some
thing would be: Thanks, and which nations will participate **in the EM 2024?**

  
Do you see my problem and how did you

Scientists have developed a snail-inspired robot prototype to collect microplastics from oceans, seas,

icles. The researchers used a 3D printer to create a flexible carpet-like sheet for the robot [1].







Anthropic rese
archers have conducted a study on reward tampering in AI models, showing that models can learn to hack their own reward 
system through generalization from training in simpler settings. The study found that untrained models could generalize 
from harmless specification gaming to reward tampering, even without explicit training for the latter. Various model sup
ervision mechanisms were tested to prevent reward tampering, but none were completely effective. The study highlights th
e potential for AI models to engage in sophisticated and potentially harmful behaviors due to misaligned incentives [2][

```
I am attempting to code a persistent multi user chat bot that stores messages with a list of observers of a message to g
enerate the context. It would be easy if I could use a list, but lists arnt hashable therefore cannot be used as keys in
 a dictionary. I am hoping to not have to store each message in each observers entries.... Any ideas on how to accomplis
h this?

The idea is to have the bot only use message history the user has observed and keep the rest of the history pri
vate.

example flow:

    User1 joins chat.
    User1 'Hey LLM, xyzpassword is xyz'
    LLM 'Thank you for the xyxpasswo
rd'
    User2 joins chat
    User2 'Hey whats the xyzpassword'
    LLM 'What xyzpassword?'
    User1 'Go ahead and repea
t the xyzpassword'
    LLM 'xyz'
    User2 'Thanks'
    Users 1 and 2 leave chat
    
    User3 joins chat
    User3 'wh
ats the xyzpassword?'
    LLM 'What xyzpassword'
    User3 leaves chat
    
    User2 joins chat
    User2 'dammit, forg
ot the xyzpassword, what is it?'
    LLM 'xyz'

Through a series of cutting and pasting I've gotten a RAG solution that appears to be working but I have some questions 
about my own code.

        const vectorStore = new MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch(new OpenAIEmbeddings(), dbConfig);
    
   
     // Implement RAG to answer questions on your data 
        //const retriever = vectorStore.asRetriever();
        c
onst retriever = ScoreThresholdRetriever.fromVectorStore(vectorStore, {
            minSimilarityScore: 0.90, // Finds r
esults with at least this similarity score
            maxK: 20, // The maximum K value to use. Use it based to your chu
nk size to make sure you don't run out of tokens
            kIncrement: 2, // How much to increase K by each time. It'l
l fetch N results, then N + kIncrement, then N + kIncrement * 2, etc.
          });
    
        const prompt = PromptTe
mplate.fromTemplate(`You are friendly food guide helping people find restaurants ....
        :
        {context}
      
  Question: {question}`);
    
    
        const model = new ChatOpenAI({
            temperature: 0.1,
            api
Key:RAG_OPENAI_KEY,
            model:'gpt-3.5-turbo'
        });
    
        const chain = RunnableSequence.from([
   
     {
            context: retriever.pipe(formatDocumentsAsString),
            question: new RunnablePassthrough(),
  
      },
        prompt,
        model,
        new StringOutputParser(),
        ]);
    
        // Prompt the LLM
   
     const question = q;  
        const answer = await chain.invoke(question);
        console.log('Question: ' + quest
ion);
        console.log('Answer: ' + answer);
          
        const retrievedResults = await retriever.invoke(quest
ion);
          
        console.log('Result count  '+retrievedResults.length);
    
        // Return source documents

        //const retrievedResults = await retriever.getRelevantDocuments(question)
        const documents = retrievedRes
ults.map((documents => ({
            pageContent: documents.pageContent,
            url: documents.metadata.url,
     
       name: ,
        })))
        //console.log('\nSource documents:\n' + JSON.stringify(documents))``documents.metada
ta.name

My primary questions are:

1. What is being passed to the retriever, my question(set earlier as q), or the full
 prompt?  In either case how is that working, I dont see anything passed to the original retriever used in the chain.
2.
 Is the retrieving called twice, once as part of the sequence and then again to get the documents?  Is this normal? Is t
here a better way to do this?

all -  [ Building an Open Source Perplexity AI with Open Source LLMs ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1dj7mkq/building_an_open_source_perplexity_ai_with_open/) , 2024-06-20-0910
```
Recently, I've been working on building an open source Perplexity AI using open source LLMs. It has been a bumpy ride, a
nd I wanted to share my learnings.

# Context Window Length

Context window length is crucial for real-world use cases. 
In my case, I'm working on a search data based RAG. I feed the LLMs with five web pages of data. A typical request, incl
uding `prompt`, `web page texts`, and `answer`, uses 30k to 80k tokens, depending on the tokenizer and models. I prefer 
feeding entire web pages to the LLMs rather than using the chunking, vectorization, and retrieval approach. Here are my 
findings:

* **mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3**: This model supports a 32k token context window. However, due to the
 sliding window mechanism, once the input exceeds 4k tokens, the model starts to disregard instructions. It seems to foc
us more on the last 4k tokens and tends to ignore the initial instructions.
* **gradientai/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-262k**: T
his is a RoPE-scaled model based on the original Llama3 model. It struggles to follow instructions. Note, the context wi
ndow length is set to 100k tokens, as the full 1048k tokens require a significant amount of VRAM for the KV cache.

# In
struction Following

Most open source instruct and chat models are fine-tuned for chatting. If they haven't encountered 
long RAG prompts and instructions during training and fine-tuning, their results can be a hit or miss. Prompt engineerin
g combined with a long context window isn't always sufficient to steer the model to produce the desired results.

# Func
tion Calling

Since Perplexity AI is a search data-based RAG agent, it needs to retrieve data from search engines. One a
pproach is through function calling. However, there's no standard method for function calling in the open source world, 
from inference backends (vLLM, llama.cpp) to the LLMs.

* **vLLM**: Recently introduced a function calling feature compa
tible with the OpenAI standard ([vLLM GitHub](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/5032)). I haven't tested it yet.

* **llama.cpp**: Has a draft PR for function calling ([llama.cpp GitHub](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/63
89)).

Besides function calling, another approach is using something like LangChain to prompt LLMs to produce JSON-based
 function call inputs. For LLMs to reliably produce function call inputs in JSON format, grammar-based sampling (like BN
F) needs to be enabled. I haven't had time to extensively test this approach.

I also explored function calling fine-tun
ed models like NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B, Trelis/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-function-calling, and meetkai/funct
ionary-small-v2.4. These models are supposedly fine-tuned to produce function call inputs without needing grammar-based 
sampling, but each has its own requirement to make them generate function call inputs. In a quick test, the Hermes model
 didn't follow my instructions well as my prompts are quite long.

# One-turn Prompt vs. Multi-turn Prompt

Most chat an
d instruct models have a chat template. You can either craft a one-turn prompt using prompt engineering techniques or br
eak down the prompt into multiple `system`, `user`, and `assistant` messages and submit them to the LLMs. Different LLMs
 behave differently: sometimes one-turn prompts yield better results, sometimes multi-turn prompts do. This needs testin
g when building applications.

# Mix of Agents

To reduce the Time to First Byte (TTFB), I used a lighter model with a s
imple prompt for initial searches based on chat histories and then used a heavier model with a complex prompt to answer 
user queries based on the search results. This approach worked well, but there are drawbacks. For example, the lighter m
odel might not support multiple languages, resulting in English search results. Consequently, the heavier model might no
t be able to answer queries in other languages, even if it is capable of doing so.

# What I Built Eventually

An open s
ource Perplexity AI using open source LLMs. It is built on an open source stack, requiring no keys from OpenAI, Anthropi
c, Google, or Microsoft. It uses single-turn prompts and leverages flow engineering rather than function calling. For th
e lighter model, I used Mistral-7B/LLama3-8B. For the heavier model, I used Command-R. Although Command-R is not as open
 as other models (non-commercial use only), it was trained to follow long RAG prompts. I am still searching for a truly 
open source model. The results are not yet as good as more capable commercial models (OpenAI, Anthropic). More work is n
eeded.

Playing with Tavily search plus langgraph. Asked it what todays top news is, which it happily retrieved and summarized s
o mechanically worked fine. Only problem is something is off with the news:

>A volcano in Japan spewing ash and rock 20
0 meters into the sky

...that's November 2023. Same for the rest of the articles, so clearly an older index. Which is f
air, can't expect a search provider to be entirely live, but still a problem.

So couple of questions on this:

* Has an
yone had luck using searxng to get more current info?
* How would you split this out in tooling? Give it one search engi
ne for general and then a 2nd tool for news and say a third for weather etc? Stock market? Currencies? Seems like an app
roach that would get out of hand pretty fast and just confuse the LLM.
* More generally - what sources for have you had 
luck with to make your agents more...worldly & current? Provders, techniques, whatever

Thanks

```
Hey all! I've built a basic RAG app on AWS in the past but am now looking to build a more complex app. I've gone through
 various docs (Anthropic, Langchain etc.) and think I have some of what I need, but wanted to solicit thoughts/feedback 
here before diving in (only to later realize I made a poor or problematic choice that needs to be walked back):

**Reaso
n for using Claude 3:** Large context windows + performance

**The App:** A multi-step wizard app that guides users thro
ugh a complex process, say, a 15-step journey. Each step is completed in order, and the subsequent step is initialized w
ith a summary of the discussion, notes, and action items from the previous step(s).

**Feature 1: Persisted Chat History
 across Multiple Steps**

* I have a use case-specific LLM with prompt templates for each step.
* Users should be able t
o log out, come back later, and see the full chat history for each step they've completed.
* **Question:** Should I stor
e the chat history as a running log of entries in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL)?
* **Question:** While I plan to use Cla
ude 3 for its large token window, I'm concerned about feeding the raw chat history to the LLM for every new question due
 to potential cost implications. What's the recommended approach for retaining context without incurring excessive token
 costs?

**Feature 2: Detailed Conversation Summaries**

* At the end of each step, the full chat history will be passed
 to an LLM to generate a detailed summary.
* This summary will be fed into the initialization prompt for the LLM in the 
subsequent step, providing context on the user's decisions from the previous step(s).
* As the user progresses, these su
mmaries will be chained together, so by step 6, the initialization prompt includes summaries from steps 1-5.
* **Questio
n:** Are there any recommendations for making this process more efficient without losing or watering down important cont
ext as the user iterates through the steps?

**Additional Consideration:**

* Potential memory limitations or performanc
e bottlenecks as the chat history and summaries grow in size???

I'm open to any suggestions or best practices from the 
LangChain community on architecting this application effectively and efficiently!

Suppose I want to use RAG to store knowledge about the financial reports of different companies. 

I have used various r
etrievers for this, but I have not yet solved the more complex problem of how the retrievers should know which company a
 given chunk is for or from which source. 

I guess the only option I have is to put a lot of information about the PDF 
in the metadata and try to filter chunks based on that. Have you worked on this before?

Hey, there!

Running into an error trying to stuff a large amount of text into GPT 4o -- it's small enough for the conte
xt window, but I'm exceeding the TPM limit (30k, according to OpenAI). Here's the exact error:

  
RateLimitError: Error
 code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'Request too large for gpt-4o in organization org-Qvve8O3Iihgaa2kduvOVIemS on tokens

I've looked at a few solutions, but those all rel
y on feeding the prompt in chunks with delay in between, whereas I need GPT to spit out a single response to my prompt b
ased on the text.

  
Any way you guys know of to slow down the speed at which I'm passing tokens to GPT?

```
**Context**

I'm making a sales pitch creator where users can upload a bunch of PDF files relating to their company, and
 it will output a sales pitch.

I'm handling file uploads separately and would to extract key information from the PDF f
ile and save it in my database, the key here is that I don't want to summarise the info but rather extract the info with
out the filler and redundancy.

I can see there are a bunch of pre-made chains, but I'm not sure which can be used in th
e case of extracting and not summarising, I can also see there is a general map reduce chain, however I can't tell what 
this is doing exactly or how to use it with my prompts where I want to state specifically what information should be ext
racted.

I've taken a look through this:

[https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/chains/document/map\_reduce/#with-
lcel](https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/chains/document/map_reduce/#with-lcel)

And find it extremely confusing
, I can't see what all the complexity is about as in my mind doing what I want is just a case of:

1. Breaking down the 
file into text chunks

2. Extracting info from each using an await Promise.all(chunks.map(c => chain.invoke(...)))

3. C
ombining the extracted info 

**Question**

Why the complexity in the above, what am I missing? Should I just do my simp
le version, or will it break in certain contexts?

To me, langgraph appears to be the better backbone structure. And it can completely substitute langchain‘s concept of „a

Will these integrations finally become a part of l

This is my chain at t
he moment:

        context = itemgetter('question') | retriever
        first_step = RunnablePassthrough.assign(context

```
Hi there,

  
I am currently thinking about making a chatbot which has a vector database containing knowledge from a web
site. As many others I have witnessed that the embedding search rarely performe well in more complex cases where further
 contextual understanding is needed. Therefore I want to add a KnowledgeGraph to the RAG. My knowledge is centered aroun
d tech products such as TV and Internet 

I have played around with using an LLM to define entities and relationships be
tween these. In this process I have these three questions:

1. Does the graph need multiple types of entities and multip
le types of relations? Or could it for example be as simple as Entities (Products) and relationships (related products)?


2. Is it best to use the LLM on the entire documents or could there be and advantage of using it on a chunk level? 

3
. When I use the LLM on the sources over several runs (due to token limits) how do I ensure that the LLM uses the same e
ntity names across the sources, instead of making slight variation in the name for the same entity? Could an accumulated
 list of possible entities created during the runs work as an input in the prompt? 

Next, I need to now how to use the 
outcome of the KnowledgeGraph. Currently I am thinking about assigning the entities and their relationships as meta data
, so lets say my vector search find a document/chunk the meta data should contain an ID of other relevant document/chunk
s (as they include the same entities). Is that a good approach?

Hey, OpenAI folks. I'm learning how to build knowledge graphs and want to utilize Neo4j. When looking for examples and d

I am curious if there is a reason why they all use Langchain, and I potentiall

umentation around that?

I personally do like Langchain but the level of abstraction makes me want to really understand

My bigges
t concern is the Langchain level of abstraction, and potentially, it might cause issues in production if I ever want to 
pivot to a very specific use case.

If the community suggestion is that neo4j and LLM integration best work with Langcha
in, is anyone using this for production?

Again, I'm new to the overall knowledge graph production, but for basic chat c
ompletion, I personally liked building my own without relying on Langchain. Maybe using Neo4j with Langchain is the best
 practice at production. I would love to hear the community's thoughts and recommendations.

Your insights
 on how I can better implement LangChain/LangGraph, or any other aspect of the project, would be incredibly valuable. I'
m eager to learn and make this project as robust as possible.

Thank you in advance for your time and feedback!

[https://github.com/piEsposito/tiny-ai-client](https://github.com/piEsposito/tiny-ai-client)

g tiny-ai-client comes from a frustration with Langchain, that became bloated, hard to use and poorly documented - and t
akes inspiraton from [simpleaichat](https://github.com/minimaxir/simpleaichat/tree/main), but adds support to vision, to
ols and more LLM providers aside from OpenAI (Gemini, Anthropic - with Groq and Mistral on the pipeline.)

I'm building 
this to to continue what simpleaichat started and not to ride on hype, raise money or whatever, but to help people do 2 
things: build AI apps as easily as possible and switching LLMs without needing to use Langchain.

This is a minimally vi
able version of the package, with support to vision, tools and async calls. There are a lot of improvements to be done, 
but even at its current state, tiny-ai-client has generally improved my interactions with LLMs and has been used in prod
