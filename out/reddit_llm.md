Hi everyone,

I'm stuck deciding the infrastructure for my production RAG chat.I am trying to decide between using a Fas
tapi server in python, or try to create everything in the Nextjs project with Typescript.

My thoughts so far:

1. There
 is no ready-made Hybrid-search for Supabase in Python (but there is in JS)
2. The more advanced RAG features seem to be
 released in the Python version of Langchain first. like Cohere Reranking, Hyde, Query-expansion etc.
3. I already have 
the setup for the RAG in langserve, but I'm struggling working out how to keep a good chat history integrated against th
e nextjs frontend and the langserve server.
4. I'm leaning towards Supabase pgvector as my vector storage, since I feel 
it's more cost-effective and safe in terms of control (the RAG chat will include that the user can upload files, and mix
 a lot of different businesses on the same index in Pinecone doesn't seem like the best approach, maybe I'm wrong?)

&#x
200B;

Would appriciate some feedback so I can make the decision and move forwards.

```
So , I'm a beginner in LLMs. I'm working on creating a chatbot that can mimic a person based on his information (the dat
a contains info like his likes , dislikes and relationships and others)

I tried creating a synthetic data using gpt wit
h query response pairs and finetuned using autotrain which didn't work out.

Now , I tried using langchain and gave a te
xt file with the person data and then also a  prompt template asked it to roleplay the person using the context in the d
ata. This works but it reverts back to question like 'what do u think about ai' , where it says as a ai language model ,
 it can't answer it.

I used WizardLM Llama model. I think issues with context window can come as well if the data is bi
g. 

How can I work on this idea? Is there any ways to improve upon the langchain idea or should I have used a different
 approach altogether?

 This is my first post on this subreddit, so hello everyone! ;)

I'm currently working on a locally hosted chatbot for a
n HR division to assist with their daily tasks. I'm using LLaMA 2, RAG, and LangChain as orchestrator. However, I'm faci
ng a challenge due to my limited experience in dealing with a large number of text documents—specifically, how to effect
ively store and organize them and then integrate them into a vector database. Simply storing data on physical disks does
n't provide me with the necessary version control for my data (and maybe analytics?). Moreover, I'm keen on implementing
 version control for the vector database itself. Do any of you have tips on how commercial projects typically structure 
such initiatives and what tools they employ?

Thank you all in advance!

I'm following the langchain example [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/#adding-source
s) that is used to cite sources. It works great when the answer actually comes from the context.  But a simple query suc
h as 'hello' will answer with 'Hello!' with sources. So even irrelevant sources are returned.  Is there anyway to modify
 the LCEL provided by langchain to not return sources if it doesn't find an answer from them?

I've also tried **Retriev
alQAWithSourcesChain** and it works better when returning sources, but it's not returning any metadata - only the link. 
Additionally, the quality of the results vs LCEL (human evaluation) seems to fall short. The only way I know change the 
quality of the results is to use custom PromptTemplates, but still not sure how to get the metadata.

So I'm playing around with the agent framework Autogen and I'm trying to create agents by providing it cust
om tools to use. These custom tools are defined in the langchain framework. Furthermore, I am using open source LLM mode
ls like Mistral, LLAMA, Mixtral etc.

In my experience, I have been unable to get the Autogen+LocalLLM framework to iden
tify the right tools to use given the prompt. However it does a fantastic job with the GPT model. 

Please note that my 
goal is for the agent to mandatorily use the tools provided and not come up with its own code. And the agent should figu
re out the right tool to use. 

I have been very explicit with my prompting, despite which I am unable to get this to wo
rk.

Any thoughts and suggestions? Please let me know ! Please share your experiences as well. Cheers !

Hello everyone.

We are still getting to grips with langchain, but we were able to get a phind-34B llm outputting the pr
efix using prompt tempate, works very well with tools. Problem is that we want to finetune a llama-2 70B using qlora to 
a 4bit, and for the life of us, we cannot get the llm to output the prefix in its responses , for example, we can't get 
it to respond as AI;  so the output parser picks it up. We tried all kinds of stuff in the prompt template like 'ALWAYS 
respond as AI: for example 'AI: (your response here)' which seems to work really well with the phind 34b (TheBloke awq v
ersion). 

Can anyone give us a hint of how to get langchain ConversationChatAgent (for conversation and tool usage) to 
work with a llama-2 based llm? We've been at it for 4 days, and no luck. 

Thanks in advance.

 and straightforward.

But when I run this setup in as Celery worker, I observe that it **loads the tool and initializes

```
I tried to make a coding assistant some time ago. It should read my repo and point out and suggest code quality improvem
ents, suggest alternate design patterns, point out where complexity is getting out of hand, or even suggest alternate va
riable names.

However, I noticed that when I ask a question like the included 'What is the class hierarchy', or even so
mething specific about a specific struct or a file, the database does NOT include that struct or file in the context sen
t to the model! Chroma was terrible, but there was an online vector store (was it Activeloop's Deeplake?) that was much 
better at retrieving code chunks related to my question. Now, of course, the code doesn't run anymore (maybe I didn't pi
n some libraries in requirements.txt) so I can't show you the Documents the db loaded, but trust me they were terrible.


A few questions:
1. is Chroma really bad and I should use another vector db or do I have to tune it to get it to work? 
After all it's just a database storing numbers... maybe I have to try something other than 'mmr'?
2. Is there a better w
ay of getting context to the model? Right now the best I've found is https://cursor.sh/ but I want something that just r
eads my repo once I make a git commit and suggests any blind spots or points of improvement.
3. Just looking at my code 
real quick - any avenues I could improve context for the model?  Are embeddings better than simply including the code in
 the context? Perhaps embeddings take up less context space?

-tool-for-rapidly-generating-synthetic-fine-tuning-datasets/](https://blog.langchain.dev/introducing-tuna-a-tool-for-rap
idly-generating-synthetic-fine-tuning-datasets/)

From what I understand, Tuna generates question-answer pairs for each 
individual section of text, rather than creating complex cross-topic question-answer pairs that encompass the entire doc
ument. There is the 'Multi chunk' feature where it can take up to 5 chunks maximum, but still not taking into account an
ywhere near the entire document or multiple documents.

My point is that research, e.g.: the LIMA paper, suggests that t
he model will perform best and converge more quickly when provided with complex, high-quality question-answer data. Howe
ver, is it possible that the model could converge just as well with less intricate data, provided that there is a suffic
ient amount of it?

I see that Andrew Gao developed this, I will try reach out directly to him.

I ingested a bunch of documents into a postgres table, where 1 column is a vector embedding (pgvector extension) and the
 rest of them are a bunch of metadata and 1 column of the original text.  


I want to use this as a retrieval source in
 a RAG application. I'm finding it hard to use Langchain's [pgvector](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vec
torstores/pgvector) feature - since I didn't create the table itself using langchain.  


Does anyone have examples or p
ointers to using a separately generated vector table with langchain's pgvector feature? Or is using a custom retriever m
y only path forward?

I have a project that requires to extract data from complex word documents.

Each document is composed of a few tables (
10 to 30). In each tables I might have :

* Text
* Mathematical equations
* Images (mostly math graphs).

My initial goa
l is to be able to process the text and equations, I'll leave the images for latter.

So far I haven't been able to retr
ieve the equations in the table. I have tried the following methods:

* langchain + docx2txt : 1 huge blob of text, not 
exploitable at all.
* lagnchain + unstructured in classical mode : same.
* langchain + unstructured + elements : I got a
 list of tables, which is nice, however in both the tables\[1\]\['kwargs'\]\['metadata'\]\['text\_as\_html'\] and tables
\[1\]\['kwargs'\]\['page\_content'\] the equations aren't shown.
* pandoc docs -> html : both the equations and images a
re represented as html **{=html}** and no content is shown.

Hi, beloved sub!

I have tried to find any ready-to-go simple examples of local model response evaluation with GPT4 but 
have seen only complicated implementations with heavy libraries like langchaing, etc. 

[Here](https://colab.research.go
ogle.com/drive/1sfxCoW2tJd6IJ_psSumGWzNwqEbtbu-4?usp=sharing), I implemented a simple Python LLM answers scoring Colab w
ith GPT4 API and OpenAI functions. You can adapt it to process multiple responses from the local LLM, which could be use
ful for comparing different models. 

It is a reliable approach that I first encountered in the paper '[TinyStories](htt
ps://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759)' (where a tiny 2.5 **million** parameters model solves a Creative Writing task), and base
d on their approach, I made a new version that our team uses for Creative Writing task evaluation at [littlestory.io](ht
tps://littlestory.io) (kids bedtime stories generation, we have scored like that thousands of stories already).

All sco
res will be given in the valid JSON format. 

**How to use colab:**

1) Specify your text language and past text that yo
u want to score;

2) Specify your API key;

3) Update agent if needed; our mainly focuses on kids' safety and creative w
riting;

4) Batch process answers of your local LLM and save responses.

That's it. It's quite simple

My current plan is to use OpenAI as the primary language learning model, focusing on affordability. I am considering i

I'm also looking into open-source embedding models to pair with t

Does anyone have reco

This is probably a really easy answer. Don’t laugh - I’m still learning.

I’m using on offline model with RAG. The data 
is stored in a Chroma DB. It’s doing its job, answering questions on the data it’s been training on (pdf books on data e
ngineering, governance and strategy). I’ve named it ‘Eva’. But how do I get it to respond to that? If I ask it for its n
ame, how do I get it to call itself Eva?

Right now the question gets passed into langchain RetrievalQA with chain_type=
‘stuff’. 

Do I need to feed it a md file into the Database to ‘tell it about itself’, or do I pass additional context i
nto the RetrievalQA process on every query?

When working with LLMs, I frequently experience *token agony*.

[Error: This model's maximum context length is 4097 but 
you are trying to push in all of War and Peace, you imbecile](https://preview.redd.it/nldj0qva4s4c1.png?width=1348&forma
t=png&auto=webp&s=b16af79d83f329db1b77b32ed621f0138d7cc04d)

Perhaps you've experienced it too! The issue is particularl
y pronounced with retrieval augmented pipelines, since you have potentially quite a large set of documents which you cou
ld perhaps include in the prompt if only you knew how big it could be.

I got tired of hacking around this headache, so 
I wrote `flex-prompt` to address it. I wish I didn't have to. Perhaps someone can point me to a better solution! But I c
ouldn't find one, so alas, here it is.

`flex-prompt` provides a basic layout and component model to help you describe h
ow you want the pieces of your prompt to grow and shrink and a token-aware renderer which renders your prompt to fit you
r model's window.

[Github](https://github.com/queerviolet/flex-prompt), [Intro to flex prompt colab](https://colab.rese
arch.google.com/github/queerviolet/flex-prompt/blob/main/doc/intro_to_flex_prompt.ipynb)

# Quick examples

You can just
 `render(Flex(...))`, and flex prompt will fit the prompt into the context window, and tell you how many tokens are left
 over for the response:

    from flex_prompt import render, Flex, Expect
    rendered = render(
        Flex([
        
  'Given the text, answer the question.',
          '--Text--',
          WAR_AND_PEACE,
          '--End Text--',
     
     'Question: What's the title of this text?',
          'Answer:', Expect()
        ], join='\n'),
        model='tex
t-davinci-002')
    
    # rendered.output is the string to send to the model
    # rendered.max_response_tokens is how 
many tokens you can
    #   request in response without exceeding the model's context window
    print(rendered.output, 
rendered.max_response_tokens)

More typically, you'll want to define a prompt which takes parameters. To do this, you ca
n create a class (probably a dataclass) which derives `Flexed`:

    from flex_prompt import Flexed, Expect
    from dat
aclasses import dataclass
    
    @dataclass
    class Ask(Flexed):
      text: str
      question: str
      answer: s
tr | Expect = Expect()
      instruct: str = 'Given a text, answer the question.'
    
      flex_join = '\n' # yielded 
items will be joined by newlines
      def content(self, _ctx):
        if self.instruct:
          yield 'Given the tex
t, answer the question.'
          yield ''
        yield '-- Begin Text --'
        # note: we're using `Flex` here jus
t to attach a flex_weight
        # to the text, telling the renderer we'd like more space for the
        # text than a
nything else.
        yield Flex([self.text], flex_weight=2)
        yield '-- End Text --'
        yield 'Question: ', 
self.question
        yield 'Answer: ', self.answer

The renderer works much as you might expect. You can \`yield\` anyt
hing which you can pass to the top-level render function, including other components, creating a whole tree.

Note that 
the component above can be used to render both the actual prompt and examples. Examples simply have an `answer`. This is
 useful for experimenting with different ways of structuring a prompt while ensuring that all the examples we present to
 the LLM are in the same format.

# LangChain and Haystack Integrations

Flex prompt doesn't really care how you execute
 your prompt. For convenience, `render(model=)` does accept both LangChain and Haystack models:

    ask_tolstoy = Ask(t
ext=WAR_AND_PEACE, question='Who wrote this?')
    
    # Using LangChain
    from langchain.llms import OpenAI
    lc_l
lm = OpenAI()
    rendering = render(ask_tolstoy, model=lc_llm)
    print(lc_llm(rendering.output, max_tokens=rendering.
max_response_tokens))
    
    
    # Using Haystack
    from haystack.nodes import PromptModel
    
    hs_llm = Prompt
Model(model_name_or_path='text-davinci-002', api_key=os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'])
    rendering = render(ask_tolstoy, m
odel=hs_llm)
    print(hs_llm.invoke(rendering.output, max_tokens=rendering.max_response_tokens))
    

# Is it worth it
?

As models grow larger and larger context windows, I've asked myself whether this is worth it. Won't context sizes eve
ntually big enough to put in everything we might want without worry?

One response: 'everything I might want' is a very,
 very big set, plausibly bigger than any window size we're going to see soon.

Another: being able to do this kind of to
ken accounting is useful even if we don't completely fill context windows. For example, we might be able to augment our 
prompt with examples, documents, and tips. How much space should we allocate to each? The answer might well be model-dep
endent. How do we figure it out?

Flex prompt's output, a `Rendering` object, actually holds the entire component tree. 
You can look through the object to see how many tokens were allocated to each child. This is currently very manual, but 
it does provide the bedrock infrastructure to e.g. run tests to discover the optimal balance of augmented data for a giv
en prompt and model.

Additionally, the right admixture (and for that matter, the right *phrasing*) may well be model-de
pendent. Flex prompt currently provides only very limited model-specific rendering (you can look at [`ctx.target`](https
://ctx.target), but it doesn't tell you much), but there's no reason that can't be significantly improved. At the extrem
e limit is prompt *erasure*, where we fine-tune a model to require no or minimal instructions/examples for a given set o
f prompts. Flex prompt can enable transitions like this with no changes to the pipelines themselves: you'd still use the
 same prompt components, they'd just render differently if the target is a fine-tuned model vs. a generic one.

# Status
 & Future Work

Flex prompt is very much in early development. I would love to hear if and how people find it useful, an
d would love input and contributions!

Some things I'd like to tackle in the future:

* **Rendering message lists.** Fle
x prompt currently only renders strings, though it's set up to be able to render any type of output. Message histories b
asically grow without bound, so supporting this seems like a no-brainer.
* **Pagination**. If your rendering overflows (
as above, where we're trying to stuff *the entirety of war and peace* into a prompt), flex prompt will clip the offendin
g pieces to fit. But there's currently no way to get 'the next page'. But the `Rendering` actually retains enough inform
ation to do this! It would be great to be able to call `render(...).pages()` to get the sequence of prompts as we 'scrol
l' whatever has overflowed. This is medium-hanging fruit—a little tricky because we do have to descend the tree of rende
rings to find the exact one(s) which overflowed and then update only those.
* **Token accounting.** As mentioned above, 
you can currently grovel around in `Rendering` and look at the pieces of the prompt. This would be more useful if it wer
e a little easier, e.g. if you could use `rendering[Examples]` to find all the parts rendered by the `Examples` componen
t, or `rendering['advice']` to find all the parts which are tagged (somehow) as 'advice'. The use case here is prompt op
timization: discovering the optimal number or percentage of tokens to allot to each thing we might want to drop into the
 prompt.
* **More integrations.** Currently, flex prompt only supports OpenAI models. You can register your own target f
inders, but it would be great to have more support out of the box. This is mostly a matter of digging around and finding
 the tokenizers and window sizes for common models, and then writing the appropriate target finders. Contributions very 
welcome!
* **Model tuning.** As mentioned above, the rendering context could provide a mechanism for fetching model-spec
ific parameters. The basic idea is that `ctx[param]` will evaluate `param` against the context, and then we can define s
ome parameter types which load their model-specific values from *gestures vaguely* somewhere.

Language models have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), yet they grapple with limitations that impede the
ir full potential. Enter LangChain, a pioneering framework that transcends these constraints, fostering innovative langu
age-based applications. To comprehend LangChain’s significance, we must first grasp the limitations plaguing large langu
age models (LLMs).
