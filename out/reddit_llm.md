```
Over the past year of building AI-enabled SaaS applications, I kept hitting the same wall. Going from a Jupyter notebook
 full of AI RAG techniques to something usable in my app was a nightmare. I'm sure if anyone here has taking a look at l
lama-index or langchain cookbook sections you might understand what I'm talking about.  
  
I came to the conclusion tha
t this is the problem:  
\- Notebooks are great for testing ideas, but they’re not meant for building applications aroun
d them.  
\- I had to manually dissect notebooks, build a proof-of-concept API server, integrate it into my app, and pra
y it worked.  
\- The feedback loop was \*painfully\* long—and most of the time, I canned the project because it didn’t 
quite fit.  
  
This frustration comes from a gap in roles:  
1. Data Scientists/AI Devs want notebooks to experiment wi
th methods and techniques—but it's not their main focus to also create an API for other applications to use.  
2. App De
velopers just want simple APIs to test and integrate quickly to see if it actually enhances their app.

This is where Ki
tchenAI comes in. A tool that bridges this gap by transforming your AI Jupyter notebooks into production-ready API serve
r in minutes.  
  
But why??  
\- Shorter Development Cycles  
Test, iterate, and deploy AI techniques faster and cut th
e feedback loop in half.  
\- Vendor and Framework Agnostic  
Use the libraries you’re comfortable with, no lock-ins.  

\- Plugin Architecture  
Extend functionality with plugins for evaluation frameworks, observability, prompt management, 
and more.  
\- Open Source and Local-First  
Built on trusted technologies like Django, so you stay in control—no 3rd-pa
rty dependencies required.  
\- Docker-Ready  
Share your API server as a lightweight container for easy collaboration. 
 
  
We’ve released KitchenAI as an Apache-licensed open-source tool, so anyone can use it. Up next is a managed cloud v
ersion with deeper integrations, metrics, analytics, and workflows for teams with more complex needs. One short term goa
l is to go straight from colab to a KitchenAI cloud hosted API so development can be absolutely seamless.

```
I like to build a recommendation system with RAG and wanted to hear others thoughts. I want to give recommendations base
d on multiple quizzes students take. For example, students would take 2-3 tests and based on those results, recommend qu
estions that they need to solve to improve their skills.

Here my data would be the following. For each test: testId, qu
estion number, choice selected(A,B,C,D), O/X (correct/incorrect) and category that the question belongs to.

My thinking
 is: I would feed these data into a vectorstore. Now when student has take 3 tests, I would feed this and based on those
 3 tests, I will do some kind of similiarity search and recommend questions that other students got wrong/correct and ge
t those test+question number out.

Would something like this be possible with RAG?

Background: I have been working as a GenAI Engineer from mid of 2023 and basically this is what I have started my career
 with. I knew python and then as things came out I was doing development and learning the frameworks like Langchain, Lan
gGraph, Streamlit, Chainli, LlamaIndex, Haystack and what not.. I know a bit about Azure as we did deployments on azure.



After 1.5 year of experience in this domain, I think this is something that should not be your only skill. I want to 
learn something that will complement GenAI. I have exploring few options like DevOps, WebDevelopment ( the path is too l
ong, HTML, CSS, Javascript and goes the list goes on). What do you think I should learn/focus so that in some time I’ll 
standout from the crowd?

```
Hello everyone, how are you?  
For some time now, I've been self-studying the development of an AI for customer support 
services.

One challenge I've been facing—and it seems to be a common issue—is the humanization of the AI. But let's put
 that aside for now.

My current idea is: is using LangChain + RAG a good approach to keep moving forward?

I'm organizi
ng all the company's information, such as departments, types of service, when the AI should transfer to another departme
nt, and its behaviors, into a markdown file. However, I feel that its performance isn't as good compared to another AI I
’ve implemented purely in Node.js, with all the context embedded directly in the prompt.

If you have any ideas on how I
 can proceed or what I should study, I’d appreciate it. Also, if there’s something I need to change in my mindset regard
ing the current LangChain + RAG project, feel free to share.

Edit: Forgot to share more info.  
I'm using LANGCHAIN+RAG
+Multiquery.

The user says something, which is then rephrased into 5 different variations. Based on these variations, s
imilarity is searched, and a response is returned accordingly.

I have the following agent workflow to do a calculation:

`# Graph`

`from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph, START
`

`from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode`



`# Define a new graph`

`workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)`



`# Define
 the nodes we will cycle between`

`workflow.add_node('agent', agent)  # agent`

`retrieve = ToolNode([retriever_tool])`


`workflow.add_node('retrieve', retrieve)  # retrieval`

`workflow.add_node('rewrite', rewrite)  # Re-writing the quest
ion`

`workflow.add_node(`

`'generate', generate`

`)  # Generating a response after we know the documents are relevant
`

`# Call agent node to decide to retrieve or not`

`workflow.add_edge(START, 'agent')`



`# Decide whether to retriev
e`

`workflow.add_conditional_edges(`

`'agent',`

`# Assess agent decision`

`tools_condition,`

`{`

`grade_documents,

`workflow.add_edge('generate', END)`

`workflow.add_edge('rewrite', 'agent')`



`# Compile`

`graph = workflow.
compile()`

  
And here is the flow diagram:

=43e6c3bcae27e18267e1b931e7ee39c99310b03e

For example, the user question would be, 'What is the cost of books?', and th
e agent will do a search in the vector DB for the total cost of books and return a response.

I have the same type of ca
lculation to be done for 3 different things (say, calculate cost of books, cost of pens and cost of blackboards, and to 
find the total cost incurred we just sum these 3 up). I want to be able to repeat/replicate the retrieve-rewrite-generat
e part of the workflow for the 3 calculations, connect them to the main agent node, and then combine the 3 generate node
s into a 'totalCost' node to reach the \_end\_ node. How do I do that?  


The user question would be, 'What is the tota
l cost of this classroom', and I want the agent to break it down into 3 questions: 'What is the cost of books?', 'What i
s the cost of pens?' and 'What is the cost of blackboards?', and then do the vector DB querying for each of these questi
ons, get responses for each of these queries, sum them all up and give the final response.

```
# CONTEXT
I'm a noob building an app that analyses financial transactions to find out what was the max/min/avg balance e
very month/year. Because my users have accounts in multiple countries/languages that aren't covered by Plaid, I can't re
ly on Plaid -- I have to analyze account statement PDFs.

Extracting financial transactions like ||||||| 2021-04-28 | 45
2.10 | credit ||||||| _almost_ works. The model will hallucinate most times and create some transactions that don't exis
t. It's always just one or two transactions where it fails.

I've now read about Prompt Chaining, and thought it might b
e a good idea to have the model check its own output. Perhaps say 'given this list of transactions, can you check they'r
e all present in this account statement' or even way more granular do it for every single transaction for getting it 100
% right 'is this one transaction present in this page of the account statement', _transaction by transaction_, and have 
it correct itself.

# QUESTIONS:
1) is using the model to self-correct a good idea?

2) how could this be achieved? 

3)
 should I use the regular api for chaining outputs, or langchain or something? I still don't understand the benefits of 
these tools

# More context:
- I started trying this by using Docling to OCR the PDF, then feeding the markdown to the L
LM (both in its entirety and in hierarchical chunks). It wasn't accurate, it wouldn't extract transactions alright
- I t
hen moved on to Llama vision, which seems to be yielding much better results in terms of extracting transactions. but st
ill makes some mistakes
- My next step before doing what I've described above is to improve my prompt and play around wi
th temperature and top_p, etc, which I have not played with so far!

all -  [ Event-Driven Patterns for AI Agents ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1ha8mrc/eventdriven_patterns_for_ai_agents/) , 2024-12-10-0914
```
I've been diving deep into multi-agent systems lately, and one pattern keeps emerging: high latency from sequential tool
 execution is a major bottleneck. I wanted to share some thoughts on this and hear from others working on similar proble
ms. This is somewhat of a langgraph question, but also a more general architecture of agent interaction question.

# The
 Context Problem

For context, I'm building [potpie.ai](https://potpie.ai/), where we create knowledge graphs from codeb
ases and provide tools for agents to interact with them. I'm currently integrating langgraph along with crewai in our ag
ents. One common scenario we face an agent needs to gather context using multiple tools - For example, in order to get t
he complete context required to answer a user’s query about the codebase, an agent could call:

* A keyword index query 
tool
* A knowledge graph vector similarity search tool
* A code embedding similarity search tool.

Each tool requires th
e same inputs but gets called sequentially, adding significant latency.

# Current Solutions and Their Limits

Yes, you 
can parallelize this with something like LangGraph. But this feels rigid. Adding a new tool means manually updating the 
DAG. Plus it then gets tied to the exact defined flow and cannot be dynamically invoked. I was thinking there has to be 
a more flexible way. Let me know if my understanding is wrong. 

# Thinking Event-Driven

I've been pondering the idea o
f event-driven tool calling, by having tool consumer groups that all subscribe to the same topic.

    # Publisher patte
rn for tool groups
    @tool
    def gather_context(project_id, query):
        context_request = {
            'project
_id': project_id,
            'query': query
        }
        publish('context_gathering', context_request)
        
  
  
    @subscribe('context_gathering')
    async def keyword_search(message):
        return await process_keywords(mess
age)
    
    @subscribe('context_gathering')
    async def docstring_search(message):
        return await process_docs
trings(message)

This could extend beyond just tools - bidirectional communication between agents in a crew, each reacti
ng to events from others. A context gatherer could immediately signal a reranking agent when new context arrives, while 
a verification agent monitors the whole flow.

There are many possible benefits of this approach:

# Scalability

* Hori
zontal scaling - just add more tool executors
* Load balancing happens automatically across tool instances
* Resource ut
ilization improves through async processing

# Flexibility

* Plug and play - New tools can subscribe to existing topics
 without code changes
* Tools can be versioned and run in parallel
* Easy to add monitoring, retries, and error handling
 utilising the queues

# Reliability

* Built-in message persistence and replay
* Better error recovery through dedicate
d error channels

# Implementation Considerations

From the LLM, it’s still basically a function name that is being retu
rned in the response, but now with the added considerations of :

* How do we standardize tool request/response formats?
 Should we? 
* Should we think about priority queuing? 
* How do we handle tool timeouts and retries
* Need to think abo
ut message ordering and consistency across queue
* Are agents going to be polling for response?

I'm curious if others h
ave tackled this:

* Does tooling like this already exist?
* I know Autogen's new architecture is around event-driven ag
ent communication, but what about tool calling specifically?
* How do you handle tool dependencies in complex workflows?

* What patterns have you found for sharing context between tools?

The more I think about it, the more an event-driven 
framework makes sense for complex agent systems. The potential for better scalability and flexibility seems worth the ad
ded complexity of message passing and event handling. But I'd love to hear thoughts from others building in this space. 
Am I missing existing solutions? Are there better patterns?

Let me know what you think - especially interested in heari
ng from folks who've dealt with similar challenges in production systems.

t this error message saying that in the temp dir there is no model like the one i wish using (from the FlashranReranker)

```
Hi everyone,

Over the past couple of months, I've started using LangChain, but I feel like I'm missing two important co
nceptual foundations that are core to this framework. I've watched tons of tutorials, but I still can't quite grasp what
's happening under the hood.

# The Chains

In my mind, I understand that the output of the first element becomes the in
put for the second element, similar to how pipes work in Linux. The logic makes sense, and when I see examples, they are
 clear. However, I still can't come up with my own chains.

For example:  
`chain = llm | some_prompt_template`

I see t
hat the model specified in the `llm` variable will be used with the prompt defined in the second step. But what exactly 
does an LLM output? What does it look like?

# The invoke() Method

I've created a chain that is a `Runnable`, so I unde
rstand I need to invoke, call it . I interpret this as making the actual call to the LLM, with the chain being built bef
orehand. Is this understanding correct? I'm curious about what happens under the hood during invocation.

I hope I'm not
 the only one struggling to understand these concepts. If you're extensively using LangChain and these questions seem to
o obvious, please try to put yourself in the shoes of a newbie. :)

Thank you!

```
Hi everyone,

I’m a sales engineer working for a branch of an international company specializing in industrial equipment
. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering five years ago.

About six months ago, I came up with a business idea: an AI-pow
ered technical chatbot designed to provide engineers and technicians with real-time, supplier-specific answers and solut
ions for industrial equipment.

Since then, I’ve conducted market research and developed an MVP using OpenAI APIs and La
ngchain. The data powering the model is publicly available, but I’ve leveraged my industry knowledge to structure the da
ta and design the model’s architecture. While I won’t delve into technical details here, the key point is that the chatb
ot is functional and ready for demonstrations.

I’m now at the stage where I want to pitch this idea to my current compa
ny, which I believe could be a strategic partner but also a customer as this would help the internal sales teams to incr
ease their efficiency in the chaos of a multitasking environment. They have a well-established network of sales channels
 across the EU, which would be invaluable for scaling the product. My managing director can arrange a meeting with the c
ompany CEO, giving me an opportunity to present my idea to influential decision-makers.

Here’s where I’m seeking advice
:  
I’d like to maintain my current employee benefits while negotiating shared equity in this new venture. I bring indus
try expertise, mechanical and sales engineering experience, and coding skills (it’s important to emphasize that I person
ally developed the MVP).

What would you recommend I ask for in this situation, and how should I approach this discussio
n to maximize the chances of a successful partnership?

Cheers

```
Hello everyone,

I’m trying to learn how to approach the task of converting free-form English descriptions into valid Ja
vaScript functions. For example, I have a design document written in informal English that contains instructions like:


1. You receive two parameters. Add them together, divide the result by 2, and check if there is a remainder. If there is
 a remainder, print it; otherwise, print 'No remainder.'
2. You receive a structure containing keys. Search for the key 
named `'foo'` and print its value. If the key is not found, print `'Key not found.'`

And so on.

From such descriptions
, I need to create simple JavaScript functions. My goal is to figure out how to approach this problem using LangChain. I
’m using Azure AI and have a beginner-level understanding of LangChain.

Can anyone guide me on how to get started with 
this? Any advice or examples would be appreciated.

Thanks!

Hey Reddit! 👋

I’m looking for advice on the best way to learn LangChain and LangGraph from the beginning. I have some e
xperience with GenAI and Transformers and played around with Haystack last year, but now I want to start fresh and build
 a solid foundation in LangChain and LangGraph.

Here’s a bit about my background:

* Familiar with GenAI concepts and T
ransformer models.
* Used Haystack briefly for question-answering and document processing.
* Comfortable with Python and
 libraries like Hugging Face, but I wouldn’t call myself an expert.

My goals are:

1. To understand the core concepts a
nd architecture of LangChain and LangGraph.
2. To learn how to build end-to-end AI applications with these tools (e.g., 
chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation, etc.).
3. To get hands-on experience through tutorials, projects, or practice 
exercises.

If you’ve been on this learning path, I’d love to know:

* **What resources should I start with?** (docs, tu
torials, videos, courses, etc.)
* Are there any beginner-friendly project ideas to practice what I learn?
* Tips for com
bining LangChain with other tools like Vector DBs, OpenAI APIs, or custom data sources?

Thanks in advance for sharing y
our knowledge and recommendations! 🙏

```
Currently working on a PoC with multiple agents calling a database and one of these agents is a Text2SQL which can call 
3 tools:

* Tool1: find relevant tables pertaining to a users query (requires user's input)
* Tool2: calculate the cost 
of a generated sql query by the agent (requires sql query as input and outputs a number)
* Tool3: execute the sql query 
(requires cost and sql query as input)

  
I explicitly added in the descriptions of tools 2 and 3 that if Tool3 is call
ed then it needs the output of Tool2 in order to be called but it never ends up calling Tool2 despite calling Tool3. Not
 sure how I can go about sequentially programming tools or prompt engineering it to do so

        # Build graph
        builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
        builder.add_node('tool_cal
ling_llm', tool_calling_llm)
        builder.add_node('tools', ToolNode([multiply, add]))
        builder.add_edge(START
, 'tool_calling_llm')
        builder.add_conditional_edges(
            'tool_calling_llm',
            # If the latest
 message (result) from assistant is a tool call -> tools_condition routes to tools
            # If the latest message (
result) from assistant is a not a tool call -> tools_condition routes to END
            tools_condition,
        )
    
    builder.add_edge('tools', END)
        
        # Compile graph
        graph = builder.compile()

The above code ru
ns fine.

Now, I like to change the name of an edge... should be simple right? **I want to rename 'tools' to 'calc'.**


This code results in a weird error:

     # Build graph
        builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
        builder.add_
node('tool_calling_llm', tool_calling_llm)
        builder.add_node('calc', ToolNode([multiply, add])) # Changed name he
re!
        builder.add_edge(START, 'tool_calling_llm')
        builder.add_conditional_edges(
            'tool_calling
_llm',
            # If the latest message (result) from assistant is a tool call -> tools_condition routes to tools
   
         # If the latest message (result) from assistant is a not a tool call -> tools_condition routes to END
         
   tools_condition,
        )
        builder.add_edge('calc', END) # Changed name here!
        
        # Compile grap
h
        graph = builder.compile()

# The error on Studio and in the python notebook

    KeyError: 'branch:tool_callin
g_llm:tools_condition:tools'

all -  [ Fed up with LangGraph docs, I let Langgraph agents document it's entire codebase - It's 10x better! ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1h985k2/fed_up_with_langgraph_docs_i_let_langgraph_agents/) , 2024-12-10-0914
```
Like many of you, I got frustrated trying to decipher LangGraph's documentation. So I decided to fight fire with fire - 
I used LangGraph itself to build an AI documentation system that actually makes sense.  


What it Does:

* Auto-generat
es architecture diagrams from Langgraph's code
* Creates visual flowcharts of the entire codebase
* Documents API endpoi
nts clearly
* Syncs automatically with codebase updates

Why its Better:

* 80% less time spent on documentation
* Alway
s up-to-date with the codebase
* Full code references included
* Perfect for getting started with Langgraph

Would reall
y love feedback!

Hey everyone, I would like to intro
duce you my latest repo, that is a local conversational rag on your files, Be honest, you can use this as a rag on-premi
ses, cause it is build with docker, langchain, ollama, fastapi, hf All models download automatically, soon I'll add an a
bility to choose a model For now solution contains:

* Locally running Ollama (currently qwen-0.5b model hardcoded, soon
 you'll be able to choose a model from ollama registry)
* Local indexing (using sentence-transformer embedding model, yo
u can switch to other model, but only sentence-transformers applied, also will be changed soon)
* Qdrant container runni
ng on your machine
* Reranker running locally (BAAI/bge-reranker-base currently hardcoded, but i will also add an abilit
y to choose a reranker)
* Websocket based chat with saving history
* Simple chat UI written with React
* As a plus, you 
can use local rag with ChatGPT as a custom GPT, so you able to query your local data through official chatgpt web and ma
c os/ios app.
* You can deploy it as a RAG on-premises, all containers can work on CPU machines

Couple of ideas/problem
s:

* Model Context Protocol support
* Right now there is no incremental indexing or reindexing
* No selection for the m
odels (will be added soon)
* Different environment support (cuda, mps, custom npu's)

Welcome to contribute (watch, fork
, star) Thank you so much!
