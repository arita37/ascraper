He
llo all,  
As the title says, I'm failing to get to the interview stage of my applications. I graduated early (3 1/2 yea
rs) and I have been applying for remote and seattle based roles primarily on linkedin and google jobs. I will generally 
tailor the skills section of my resume depending on what a job is looking for. I am primarily looking at full stack, fro
nt end, back end, and python developer roles. I have a job offer from the internship that I took but that starts in 4-5 
months and is not in the locations I am looking for.

Potential problem points:

* Too busy
* Recruiters think I am inte
rnational/need visa
* Flawed application methods
* Busy Bolding

Hello everyone, 

&#x200B;

I want to build a RAG chatbot using case texts but I can't get good results in similarity se

When I think about the reasons for this, I suspect that repetitive sentences in legal texts are the problem. How
 can I overcome this problem? I have tried semantic chunking, parent document retrival, almost everything.

Hey,

I'm relatively new to Langchain and have primarily worked with chains and retrievers. Recently, I discovered agent
s and tools, and they seem quite powerful.

I've successfully set up an SQL agent following the documentation. Now, I'm 
interested in creating an agent that can browse both an SQL database and document-based sources.

I saw in the documenta
tion that it's possible to use multiple tools, like combining [Tavily and a retriever tool.](https://python.langchain.co
m/v0.2/docs/how_to/agent_executor/) 

I'd appreciate if someone could let me know where it's possible  to build such an 
agent and where to look for relevant resources? So far, it's been quite difficult to find anything that can point me in 
the right direction.

Thanks!

Hi everyone,

I'm new to LangChain, and currently learning LangGraph. This morning things are fine, I was trying to repl
icate the AgentExecutor using LangGraph as presented in their Youtube videos, and the agent (GPT 4.0) was able to use th
e web search tool (DuckDuckGo, btw) to search for information about weather, and return to me correct answer. 

However,
 in the evening of the same day, I could not do so anymore. The model refuse to give me real time data about weather. It
 got worse: when I specifically asked it to use function call to perform search about weather, but it even denying it fu
nction call capabilities.

Do anyone knows why this is the case? It is so frustrating!

I am creating a chatbot for my portfolio website. I am using Next.js, OpenAI API, Vercel AI SDK, Langchain and AstraDB.


As I hit request my route, LLM runs twice. The first run of LLM contains no context that I provided and the answer is j
ust simple with no information of mine. But the second run contains the context I provided from the AstraDb vector datab
ase and I get what I want.

For example: I write 'who are you', the first answer is 'I am a language model AI designed t
o assist with answering questions and engaging in conversation. How can I help you today?' and the second answer is 'I a
m Prakash Banjade.........'.

But on the frontend, I get the first answer which is not relevant.

In my RAG LLM I want to return the documents used to produce the answer. I don't want ALL the documents, but just the on
e or two that open ai used to produce the answer. 

Example

Question: what day is today?

Answer: today it's Saturday (doc2) 

With returning source documents, my context contains al
l three documents, but just doc2 have been used to answer the question. 

At the moment I'm asking open ai to put a sepa

```
So I have been busy with works these couple of weeks, what is the feedback for agents libs

Last time I checked there wa
s some promising projects but with some drawbacks (personal opinion)

- Langchain agents were complicated and over engin
eered

- crewAI and Autogen felt like vision tunneled on some goals and thus hard to extend to other use cases, plus bei
ng only tested against openAI's GPT4 I find it less reliable with local LLMs. (I am not even talking about the aggressiv
e tracing and telemetry)

I am using Langchain's SQL Agent to execute queries in natural language on my MS-SQL database. Here is my code:

`from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI`

`from langchai

`import os`



`db = SQLDatabase.from_uri('mssql+pyodbc:///?odbc_connect=DRIV

`model_name = 'gpt-4'`

`openai_api_key

`llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=model_name, temperature=0.0)`

`agent = create_sql_agen
t(llm, db=db, agent_type='openai-tools', verbose=True)`



`agent.invoke({`

`'input': 'How many article are there?'`

`
})`

  
When I run this, the agent starts hallucinating and tries to access a table named 'article,' which does not exis
t. The verbose parameter shows that it should retrieve all tables in the database, but it does not get the correct table
s. What could be the issue?

Additionally, I would like to provide metadata to explain the individual tables, but the 'm

list_runs(project_name='evaluators')`  the results contain all runs and I didnt find any correct metadata, e.g. the uniq

# Hello everyone!

My name is William, and I'm an Italian teenager passionate about computer science. I'm here to ask fo
r help developing my latest project, OpenLocalUI, a local LLM client. The project is based on Ollama and uses Flutter (D
art) for the UI and LangChain for LLM interaction (via a Python gRPC server).

But why work to yet another app to run LL
Ms on your PC, when there are already plenty of alternatives out there? Simple, **to do it better**! There is a somewhat
 paradoxical concept that expresses my goal:

>'Build open-source like closed-source.'

Most FOSS (Free and Open-Source 
Software) share the same issue; while offering powerful tools, the usage of those tools is often convoluted and hidden u
nder layers of poor UI and UX design, which is quite anachronistic! Nowadays, we have all the tools to build better expe
riences (and not just software) for users. It's time to refuse the idea that open-source software is a niche and work to
 help everyone embrace it.

Thanks for reading this far :)

So, did you get inspired? (I hope so!)

If the answer is yes
, take a look at the repository at this [link](https://github.com/WilliamKarolDiCioccio/open_local_ui). My collaborators
 and I will happily greet you on our team to help us build our vision.

```
I'm using Langchain with LLama.cpp-python because it I was the fastest solution I found out.

I notice an issue on Llama
.cpp github that stated that LLama.cpp-python is significantly slower than the original LLama.cpp, which I found to be t
rue, at least for the tests I ran.

I was wondering if there is any way to use only LLama.cpp with Langchain and not Lla
ma.cpp-python.

Hi,

I'm a newbie in the world of RAGs and LLMs but is it normal that the document retrieval takes 9-10 minutes?

I'm us
ing locally the llama3:8b model with ollama, Chroma es a vectorstore but these parts are quite fast compared to the invo

```
I don’t know you, but when I build an LLM app for a client LangChain is always more of a hassle to get started than just
 writing the ‘supporting’ code myself.

This counts for simple chains, but also for agents and function calling!

Anyone
 agree?
