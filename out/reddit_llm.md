```
Hello,



I am trying to create a workflow where the agents receive an API specification, make improvements on it and sa
ve it to a different file. I am using the example from LangChain on how to build hierarchical teams and I have created a
n 'API Enhancement Team' with two agents.

[https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/main/examples/multi\_agent/hi
erarchical\_agent\_teams.ipynb](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/main/examples/multi_agent/hierarchical_ag
ent_teams.ipynb)

One agent that will read a YAML file and provide suggestions on what needs to be improved. And one age
nt that will apply the changes to the specification and save the file.

I have created the following tools:

    @tool
 
   def read_api_spec_from_yaml(file_path: str) -> Dict:
        '''Reads an API specification from a YAML file.'''
     
   with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            api_spec = yaml.safe_load(file)
        print('Succe
ssfully read the API spec from the file.')
        return api_spec
    

    @tool
    def save_improved_spec(spec_data,
 filename, directory='Improved Specs'):
        '''
        Saves the improved API specification to a file in the specif
ied directory.
        If the file exists, it saves it with an incremented version suffix before the file extension.
   
 
        :param spec_data: The API specification data to save.
        :param filename: The base filename for the saved
 specification.
        :param directory: The directory where the file will be saved. Defaults to 'Improved Specs'.
    
    '''
        # Ensure the directory exists
        if not os.path.exists(directory):
            os.makedirs(director
y)
    
        # Split the filename to insert version suffix before the extension
        name, extension = os.path.spl
itext(filename)
    
        # Construct the base filepath without the extension
        base_filepath = os.path.join(di
rectory, name)
        filepath = base_filepath + extension  # Initial assumption: no version needed
    
        # Chec
k for existing files and increment version suffix if necessary
        version = 1
        while os.path.exists(filepath
):
            filepath = f'{base_filepath}_v{version}{extension}'
            version += 1
    
        # Write the spe
cification data to the file
        with open(filepath, 'w') as file:
            json.dump(spec_data, file, indent=4)
 
   
        print(f'Specification saved as {os.path.basename(filepath)} in '{directory}' directory.')
    

And I have d
efined the following agents:

    api_spec_expert = create_agent(
        llm,
        [read_api_spec_from_yaml], 
     
   api_spec_expert_prompt,
    )
    api_spec_expert_node = functools.partial(agent_node, agent=api_spec_expert, name='A
PI Spec Expert')
    
    api_improver = create_agent(
        llm,
        [save_improved_spec],
        api_improver_p
rompt
    )
    api_improver_node = functools.partial(agent_node, agent=api_improver, name='API Spec Improver')

The exp
ert is successfully reading the file and providing recommendations, but the improver is not using the tool and gives me 
very generic answers, like:

>Given the detailed list of enhancement suggestions for the OpenAI API specification, I wil
l now proceed to apply these enhancements to the specification document. This process involves updating the OpenAI API s
pecification (\`openai\_oas.yaml\`) according to the provided suggestions, ensuring that the documentation becomes more 
comprehensive, user-friendly, and helpful for developers.

Any advice, insights, or shared experiences with similar chal
lenges would be greatly appreciated. I'm eager to learn from the community and find a solution.



Thank you in advance.

all -  [ How to enable streaming in SagemakerEndpoint ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1bnlwrj/how_to_enable_streaming_in_sagemakerendpoint/) , 2024-03-26-0909
```
Hey everyone, 

I've got my LLM up and running using the Langchain SagemakerEndpoint class, and it's all good. However, 
because it's a RAG application, the response time isn't as snappy as I'd like. So, I started looking into ways to speed 
things up and came across the streaming feature.

Excited to try, I checked out the documentation and set the streaming 
parameter to True. But instead of speeding things up, my model got stuck in an infinite loop with no response.

Digging 
deeper, I took a look at the source code of the SagemakerEndpoint class to see what's causing the issue. Turns out, it's
 something to do with the Langchain method being used. Interestingly, when I bypass Langchain, everything works fine.

N
ow, I'm a bit perplexed. Any ideas on how to tackle this problem? Your help would be greatly appreciated!

Thought of 
sharing what I am cooking. Basically, I am building a open source LLM monitoring and evaluation suite. It works like thi
s:  
1. Install the SDK with 2 lines of code (npm i or pip install)  
2. The SDK will start shipping traces in Open tele
metry standard format to the UI  
3. See the metrics, traces and prompts in the UI(Attaching some screenshots below).  



I am mostly optimizing the features for 3 main metrics  
1. Usage - token/cost  
2. Accuracy - Manually evaluate trace
d prompt-response pairs from the UI and see the accuracy score  
3. Latency - speed of responses/time to first token  



Vendors supported for the first version:  
Langchain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI, Anthropic, Pinecone, ChromaDB  


I will open
source this project in about a week and share the repo here.

Please let me know what else you would like to see or what
 other challenges you face that can be solved through this project.

```
I'm trying to understand what are typical workflows for users/teams especially in production when working with datasets 
that are > 10+ GB.  
Specifically, I have at least three data sources that I want to create embeddings for. Unstructured
 data documents, multiple tables in data warehouses, and other semi-structured data from APIs.   
Here is what I am face
d with. Doing even medium-to-large scale data processing natively with LangChain is hard, just because python is slow fo
r such scale. Yes, I can use Ray but that creates a lot more modules to manage and it's already hard with LangChain code
-base.  
So in-general how are people doing ingestion in conjunction with LangChain ? This maybe a mistake on my part, b
ut I do not want to use LangChain for ingestion, it's not meant imo for that problem.  


Secondly, has anyone used Trac
es with LangSmith and can share experiences about it ?

What kind of flow is the evaluati
on carried out?   


I created an eval dataset using gpt4 and am curious about how this is used for evaluation.    
The 
questions and answers have already been created with eval llm.   
What flow is used to compare them?   
Does the retriev
er generate and answer questions again? Or something?   
I really don't understand, please explain

```
Hello everyone,

I'm currently developing a feature for natural language search queries. This feature enables users to p
ose questions to a knowledge base or retrieve structured/document data directly from a database. To facilitate this, I'v
e established two distinct endpoints:

1. /api/knowledgesearch for knowledge base queries.

2. /api/documentsearch for r
etrieving document data.

I'm seeking guidance on how to effectively route user queries from the search interface to the
 appropriate endpoint. Any suggestions on how to implement this would be greatly appreciated.

```
At vertex AI Prompt UI I am able to use longer  text (20k) token and get a response however when i am invoking the same 
model from my program I get the following error :-  


I am pretty sure its due to context length. What i am not clear o
n is why same text as context works fine at the Vertex AI UI but not through my program:

Hey guys, using Langchain, does anyone have any example Python scripts of a central agent coordinating multi agents (ie.
 this is a multi agent framework rather than a multi tool framework).

I have googled around for this but can't seem to 
find any.

Would really appreciate any help on this.

 try it! You can evaluate RAG module performances easily with AutoRAG.

## How I made it.

1. Crawl research articles wi
th 'Large Language Model' in title or abstract on Arxiv.
2. Select two months of articles in this year, which is around 
110 articles.
3. Use `Marker` OCR model for making it to markdown files.
4. Chunk markdown file using Langchain `Markdow
nHeaderTextSplitter` and `TokenTextSplitter`. And make it corpus data.
5. Randomly select 520 passages, and generate que
stions with custom pipeline using GPT-4.

Hope this can helps to evaluate RAG system. Thank you!

**# LLM loader overload**

There are many LLM loaders/engines, most of them rely on llama.cpp, but you don’t have to wor
ry about it for now. You can find many other “easy” options here, for example:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/com
ments/12s71wm/easy\_guide\_to\_run\_models\_on\_cpugpu\_for\_noobs\_like/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/
12s71wm/easy_guide_to_run_models_on_cpugpu_for_noobs_like/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1am0p48/revie
w\_of\_10\_ways\_to\_run\_llms\_locally/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1am0p48/review_of_10_ways_to_run_
llms_locally/) (great post!)

That last one makes an excellent point I will keep emphasizing through this post: “there i
s no single right answer \[which one\] you should pick. \[There are\] few aspects \[…\] between these tools, and you can
 decide which aspect you care about” and lists questions to consider helping you decide which one is right for you.

If 
you know how to set up a Python environment, clone git repository, get dependencies, compile yourself (or want to learn 
how to do those things), then these are the best to get started “developing something on your own”:

[https://github.com
/ggerganov/llama.cpp/](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/) (it does have a web GUI, see documentation)

[https://gi
thub.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/)

If you feel brave, like
 to tinker, and experiment, or don't like “double-click here” and “click next” technology, there are plenty of other opt
ions for you:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1847qt6/llm\_webui\_recommendations/](https://www.reddit.co
m/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1847qt6/llm_webui_recommendations/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/16eoozu/best\
_software\_webgui/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/16eoozu/best_software_webgui/)

But really, don’t go ov
erboard, for now, it is just a waste of time. If LM Studio, or GPT4All, or Jan, or Ollama works for you and does what yo
u want, I recommend stopping. But if you want to get to a more “advanced level”, you’ll need to learn how to run other o
ptions eventually. But don’t worry about it for now, I’ll tell you when. (C)

**# Loader/engine and quantization**

What
 are the differences between vLLM, llama.cpp, and others? Do you always have to use these frameworks? Are they used only
 to load the quantized model?

Let's start with an analogy: a JPG file by itself is not very useful. You need some softw
are to display its content and then different software to change (edit) it. MS Paint is perfectly fine for both, and the
re are 100s of other options. But you know, I’m not a computer-graphic-photo-editor-expert, just give me the best! Great
, here is Adobe Photoshop, $1000 please. Even if it were free, I bet 99% of users would be very unhappy with Photoshop. 
But you wanted the best, and here it is, so stop complaining!

LLM is just a big binary file which contains a particular
 type of neural network (Transformer) in a particular format (Torch, TensorFlow, …). So yes, you need some software that
 will load LLM and allow you to interact with it, just like you need a graphic viewer to see a JPG file, and another sof
tware to edit it (or software that does both).

But still, you ask, what is it about LLM + Torch + GPU that makes it so 
special? Recall matrix-matrix multiplication, or inversion, or factorization. Anything bigger than 3×3 is a pain in the 
ass to do manually, and it is only 18 (9×2) numbers! Now imagine you have to multiply (or invert, or factor) two matrice
s, say 1Mx1M. The “best” library to do that on a CPU is BLAS (+LAPACK for other matrix operations), but this is just for
 “normal” 2D matrices. Now generalize that to 3D, 4D, any-D matrices. It is completely doable in NumPy and SciPy (which 
themselves call BLAS+LAPACK), but Torch was developed specifically for that purpose (operating on multi-D arrays), and i
t turns out the GPU does it much better (faster) than the CPU. Neural networks (not only Transformer) need to do a lot o
f matrix-matrix and matrix-vector operations (in 3-,4-,5-D). So LLM + Torch + GPU is not necessary in theoretical sense,
 but it is necessary in practical sense to get results (trained LLM) in days-to-weeks instead of months-to-years. To see
 what it takes to train a new LLM from scratch, see “Creating Parameters” on this blog, it is not for the faint of heart
 (or poor):

[https://christophergs.com/blog/intro-to-large-language-models-llms](https://christophergs.com/blog/intro-t
o-large-language-models-llms)

Llama.cpp is great, and most software (all I listed earlier: LM Studio, Jan, GPT4All, Oll
ama) use that. I haven't used vLLM, but it is the same purpose: “Easy, fast, and cheap LLM serving for everyone” (quote 
from their webpage).

Llama.cpp can load the full model, but if you are “home user” (like me) this is irrelevant, see “R
equirements and inference speed” section. Yes, you can load 30-70B model into RAM (assuming enough RAM), and it will wor
k, but it will be too slow for practical use. If you really want to run a full model, it is much more efficient to rent 
a GPU from an AI cloud provider, there are other posts on how to do that and what are good practical options.

Quantizat
ion is another giant topic. “Running your first inference” section describes the easiest and fastest way to get started:
 CPU/RAM + GUI loader based on llama.cpp + GGUF. If you have to optimize for RAM/VRAM, start with 4bit. There is no poin
t discussing full/bigger models unless you have tons of VRAM (see “Requirements and inference speed” section). Even in t
hat case, if you are a beginner, you should start with something small, fast, and easy. Once you figure out how it works
, go for whatever your hardware can support. There are excellent posts with all the info you need to get started:

But don’t worry about it for now, I’ll tell you when. (D)

**# Deployment**

What is 
the best platform and best practices on the deployment phase? Do I need LLM available via API?

Looking for “best” if yo
u don’t even know what you are asking is a failing strategy. Photoshop is the best graphics software, yet I doubt most o
f us would use it even if it was free.

Yes, you’ll need LLM available via API. Llama.cpp does that, and loaders based o
n it should be able to do that, just double-check documentation. LM Studio and Jan can run an API server which you can a
ccess remotely (by “remotely” I mean through API call from the same or different computer on your home network), and bot
h have ready to use examples in Python.

At this point, you should go back to parts I marked (A), (B), (C), (D) and work
 to understand the rest. Search the web (see “Next steps” section), there are plenty of tutorials that show step-by-step
 instructions for different use cases.

**# Orchestrator**

LangChain seems to be the most popular, but is it the one to
 go for?

Sure, you can go for LangChain. But before you get to that, first you need to be able to run your interference
, and then run inference server, and then learn how to interact with that server via cURL, or Python, or Node.js (or som
ething like that), then program chatbot so that it maintains conversation continuity, at least within a single chat sess
ion. Memory and chat continuity is not automatic, LLM itself has no memory. Once you can do that, then start thinking ab
out “orchestrator”.

I find LangChain awkward and heavy for simple (conceptually) things. Somehow, it became very popula
r and propagated through many popular LLM projects. I don't know why. But there are plenty of alternatives. I like, and 
I used Microsoft’s AutoGen, it is great for an agent use case. Txtai looks great, I looked at their examples, they are c
lear, there are many positive posts here with follow up from developers, I would start with that. There is LamaIndex, La
ngroid (for agents), I haven’t used them, but I’m impressed by their documentation, tutorials, and practical examples. I
'm sure there are many more.

As this point, you should go back to parts I marked (A), (B), (C), (D) and work to underst
and the rest. Search the web (see “Next steps” section), there are plenty of tutorials that show step-by-step instructio
ns for different use cases. But first, you need to understand what you want the “orchestrator” to do, and then look for 
software that allows you to do that, not the other way around.

**# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**

Sounds cool,
 I want it!

I assume that by RAG you mean chunking, embedding, store in vector database, then compare with prompt, and 
add relevant chunks into the prompt as additional context. Until you are proficient in most of the above, then text embe
dding, then vector database, then prompt manipulation, then a chatbot (that has conversation memory), my advice is not t
o bother with your own implementation. There are plenty of options available to use:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLa
MA/comments/18jimix/help\_me\_choose\_need\_local\_rag\_options\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/18ji
mix/help_me_choose_need_local_rag_options_for/)

I used GPT4All and several others from the list, they all work perfectl
y fine, but some technical skills are needed, see “LLM loader overload” section.

At this point, you should go back to p
arts I marked (A), (B), (C), (D) and work to understand the rest. Search the web (see “Next steps” section), there are p
lenty of tutorials that show step-by-step instructions for different use cases. But first, you need to understand what y
ou want your “RAG” to do, and then look for software that allows you to do that, not the other way around.

all -  [ Efficiently Implementing Looping and Memory Storage for Disease Descriptions with LangChain ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1bmrp3x/efficiently_implementing_looping_and_memory/) , 2024-03-26-0909
```
I'm currently working on a project that involves creating a comprehensive knowledge base for various diseases and their 
corresponding treatments. For this, I've chosen to use LangChain (LangGraph).

My challenge involves processing a list o
f records, each associated with different diseases. The goal is to fetch the description of each disease from an externa
l API and then store this information in a way that can be efficiently reused. Specifically, I want to avoid making repe
ated API calls for diseases that have already been queried and instead, read their descriptions from a form of 'memory' 
or cache.

Given the unique capabilities of LangChain for managing knowledge and interacting with data, I'm looking for 
advice on how to best implement this logic. The ideal solution would involve:

1. Looping through a list of disease reco
rds.
2. Checking if the disease's description is already stored in memory (to prevent unnecessary API calls).
3. If not 
already stored, fetching the description from the API and then storing it in memory for future reference.
4. Ensuring th
at this process is efficient and aligns with the best practices for using LangChain and LangGraph.

Could anyone provide
 guidance or examples on how to implement this kind of caching mechanism within the LangChain framework? I'm particularl
y interested in how to use LangChain's features to manage state and memory efficiently, as well as any potential conside
rations for maintaining performance and scalability.

Thank you in advance for your insights and assistance!

```
I have an AI which creates summaries of a piece of text that is part of a larger body of text. As part of the output the
 AI provides its summarized section and tells me the location in the original document the summary pertains to (based on
 pg. num and line. num). 

Each line in the orig. doc has a page and line number and the AI prompt outlines this is prov
ided examples. Most of the time it gets the line number right in the output, however every now and then it will say the 
summary belongs to a section of text a couple of lines off from where it actually has summarized in the original text. I
ts never way off, just a little off every so often. Its really weird. 

Any thoughts on how to:

* Optimize? 
* Check?

MachineLearning -  [ [D] What Is Your LLM Tech Stack in Production? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1b4sdru/d_what_is_your_llm_tech_stack_in_production/) , 2024-03-26-0909
```
Curious what everybody is using to implement LLM powered apps for production usage and your experience with these toolin
gs and advice. 

This is what I am using for some RAG prototypes I have been building for users in finance and capital m
arkets.

**Pre-processing\ETL:**
Unstructured.io + Spark, Airflow

**Embedding model:**
Cohere Embed v3
Previously using
 OpenAI Ada but Cohere has significantly better retrieval recall and precision for my use case. Also exploring other ope
n weights embedding models

**Vector Database:**
Elasticsearch previously but now using Pinecone

**LLM:**
Gone through 
quite a few including hosted and self-hosted options. Went with gpt4 early during prototyping then switched to gpt3.5-tu
rbo for more manageable costs and eventually open weights models. 

Now using a fine-tuned Llama2 70B model self hosted 
with vLLM 

**LLM Framework:**
Started with Langchain initially but found it cumbersome to extend as the app became more
 complex. Tried implementing it in LlamaIndex at some point just to learn and found it just as bad. Went back to Langcha
in and now I am in the midst of replacing it with my own logic

What is everyone else using?

Edit: correct model Llama2
 70B

**Voyage AI** is the newest giant in the embedding, reranking, and search model game!

I am SUPER excited to publish our
 latest Weaviate podcast with Tengyu Ma, Co-Founder of Voyage AI and Assistant Professor at Stanford University!

We beg
an the podcast with a deep dive into everything embedding model training and contrastive learning theory. Tengyu deliver
ed a **masterclass** in everything from scaling laws to multi-vector representations, neural architectures, representati
on collapse, data augmentation, semantic similarity, and more! I am beyond impressed with Tengyu's extensive knowledge a
nd explanations of all these topics.

The next chapter dives into a case study Voyage AI did **fine-tuning an embedding 
model for the LangChain documentation.** This is an absolutely fascinating example of the role of continual fine-tuning 
with very new concepts (for example, very few people were talking about chaining together LLM calls 2 years ago), as wel
l as the data efficiency advances in fine-tuning.

We concluded by discussing ML systems challenges in serving an embedd
ings API. Particularly the challenge of detecting if a request is for batch or query inference and the optimizations tha
t go into either say \~100ms latency for a query embedding or maximizing throughput for batch embeddings.

I hope you fi
nd the podcast interesting, more than happy to discuss any of these topics with you or answer any questions about the co
ntent in the podcast! Thank you so much!
