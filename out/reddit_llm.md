```
I am happy to launch **Langtrace - an open source observability tool that collects and analyze traces in order to help y
ou improve your LLM apps**. Langtrace has two components:

* **SDK**: The SDK is a lightweight library that you can inst
all and import into your project to collect traces.
* **Langtrace Dashboard**: The dashboard is a web-based interface wh
ere you can view and analyze your traces.

Attaching a couple of GIFs for your preview.

For context, we started this pr
oject internally a while back to solve our own problems. We are currently looking for feedback on how to improve this pr
oduct and looking to boot strap a community around it. You can join our discord community using this link - [https://dis
cord.com/invite/EaSATwtr4t](https://discord.com/invite/EaSATwtr4t)

There are a couple of ways to use this product:

1. 
You can sign up using this link - [https://langtrace.ai/](https://langtrace.ai/) to the hosted version, generate an API 
key, install and initialize the SDK in your application with the API key to start sending traces.  

   1. **The SDK ins
tallation and initialization is just 2 lines of code.**
2. You can self host and use it within your own environment.

Yo
u can find more details in our docs - [https://docs.langtrace.ai/introduction](https://docs.langtrace.ai/introduction)


**Open Source and Open Telemetry**

Entire code including the SDK and the web application is open source. You can check 
it out from here - [https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/langtrace](https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/langtrace) .

The spans gen
erated by our SDKs adhere to **open telemetry standards (OTEL)** which means, you can continue to use your existing obse
rvability backend and consume these traces by installing our SDKs.

**Vendors supported**

We support OpenAI, Anthropic,
 Langchain, LlamaIndex, ChromaDB, PineconeDB. We will continue to add more in the coming weeks.

**Pricing (for the host
ed version)**

It's completely free to use at the moment. Since this is the first version, it is still rough around the 
edges and we are looking for feedback from the community to continue to improve and nail the experience. However, we may
 start to monetize the hosted version at some point at a reasonable cost. But, you can continue to use our open source v
ersion, self host and use it for free.

For more details, please do check out our launch blog post - [https://langtrace.
ai/blog/introducing-langtrace](https://langtrace.ai/blog/introducing-langtrace)

Thank you all for continuing to engage 
with me over the past few weeks. It has been super fun building this project and we look forward to hearing all your fee
dback on our Discord.

I am returning to LangChain after a few months to work on a new project, and since then, LCEL has been introduced. Is th
e old syntax being entirely depreciated? LCEL seems really hard to wrap my head around. Something as simple as a Convers

I am happy to fina
lly launch **Langtrace - an open source observability tool that collects and analyze traces in order to help you improve
 your LLM apps**. Langtrace has two components:

* **SDK**: The SDK is a lightweight library that you can install and im

* **Langtrace Dashboard**: The dashboard is a web-based interface where you ca

Attaching a couple of GIFs for your preview.

looking to boot strap a community around it.  You can join our discord community using this link - [https://discord.com/
invite/EaSATwtr4t](https://discord.com/invite/EaSATwtr4t) 

There are a couple of ways to use this product:

1. You can 
sign up using this link - [https://langtrace.ai/](https://langtrace.ai/) to the hosted version, generate an API key, ins
tall and initialize the SDK in your application with the API key to start sending traces.
   1. **The SDK installation a
nd initialization is just 2 lines of code.**
2. You can self host and use it within your own environment.

You can find 
more details in our docs - [https://docs.langtrace.ai/introduction](https://docs.langtrace.ai/introduction)

**Open Sour
ce and Open Telemetry**

Entire code including the SDK and the web application is open source. You can check it out from
 here - [https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/langtrace](https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/langtrace) .

The spans generated by o
ur SDKs adhere to **open telemetry standards (OTEL)** which means, you can continue to use your existing observability b
ackend and consume these traces by installing our SDKs.

**Vendors supported**

We support OpenAI, Anthropic, Langchain,
 LlamaIndex, ChromaDB, PineconeDB. We will continue to add more in the coming weeks.

**Pricing (for the hosted version)

It's completely free to use at the moment. Since this is the first version, it is still rough around the edges and w
e are looking for feedback from the community to continue to improve and nail the experience. However, we may start to m
onetize the hosted version at some point at a reasonable cost. But, you can continue to use our open source version, sel
f host and use it for free.

For more details, please do check out our launch blog post - [https://langtrace.ai/blog/int

```
Hey. We have worked on LLM apps that were integrated into existing workflows. So say, a customer support ticket arrives 
and my LLM chain kicks off to analyze the request, determine what to do next, and for example, write a response.

But we
 needed a way for users to check and approve these agent actions. We didn't find anything to help us with this, since mo
st things are built for chatbots.

So we started working on a human oversight tool that can be integrated into any custo
m LLM chain. Need human approval? Call our API and we'll call you back via webhook once there is a user decision.

Would be great to hear your thoughts 🙏

To learn more about prompting, I wanted to create some prompt templates in YAML. When looking for the docs, I come acros

Can somebody provide a resource on prompt

```
Hello there, I am brainstorming a project for a company that does digital marketing. They want to integrate llms into th
eir client relation processes, writing emails, proposals, documents. I think what I will be doing for them will be creat
ing a pipeline that creates separate text databases for each client, and then create a ChatGPT assistant that includes t
hese text documents in its knowledge base, such that employees can have conversations with this assistant and have it dr
aft things for them.  


My initial plan was just to use the openai api, and update per-client assistant knowledge bases
 daily. I understand there are more sophisticated approaches out there, but don't want to get too much into the weeds an
d try to keep it simple if possible. What is the easiest way to get RAG producing better writing than simple knowledge-b
ase driven chatGPT assistants per client?  


On a slightly different note, my experience lately is that Claude is super
ior for human-like writing, but i have never tried to create anything with their API, how does it compare to the OpenAI 
API for something like this?

I recently worked in a project that was heavy LLM related using openAI, but while doing that I realized that is  little 
literature about 'how to implement' or 'how it works' but a lot on papers and 'conceptual knowledge'.

An example with t
hat is that recently I was only able to understand how ReAct working in practice because of langchain implementation, li
ke if I returned an error in a function, ReAct was able to guess better the next function call. 

I'm looking for blogs,
 posts, ... people that maintain content that is more easily digestable, or some kind of refining list of papers that ar
e more 'practical oriented', do you have any recommendations?

```
**TLDR:** If you are a startup founder/know someone from tech hiring team, looking for a reliable and an *actually* hard
working moldable resource (I can commit to **at least 14 hours** daily, learn WHATEVER is required for your team and the
n join, sleep in office if required, work on war footing, take pay cuts for initial months or **work as intern** for ini
tial time while I am on NP)

**TLDR 2:** Stuck in WITCH company for 2.5 years now. And friends are becoming SDE1, SDE2, 
MTS etc. Getting sleepless nights and mental health's in total sham. I want to switch anyhow and get rid of this service
 based tag and come out of this suffocating vicious gloomy loop's dead-end, and actually build/develop something from sc
ratch.

&#x200B;

Hi fellow Redditors,

This is my first post on reddit. And perhaps my last hope/resort. The curse/tag 
of service based companies is so damn real.

No, I don't want sympathy, but I do want a chance to prove myself. And take
 some action.

Here's what's absolutely traumatizing me to the core. Will I end up rotting here in this same company til
l retirement? Can nothing be done now? Is is already too late? Have I hit the dead end?

I will be honest. I am familiar
 with many libraries and I am a jack of many, many, trades (read more to find out) but perhaps, not exactly master of on
e yet. And I think that has been THE biggest career mistake of mine so far.

&#x200B;

Firstly, my skill sets:

**Langua
ges:** C++ and Python (200+ on LeetCode, improvising on DP and recursion currently)

**Frameworks:** Flask, FastAPI, Dja
ngo (have used basic Flask at work, and completed reading the docs for all 3, read most asked interview questions, espec
ially ORMs views models in Django)

**AI/ML Familiarity:** Have used quite a few HF LLM APIs on inference using transfor
mers library, created APIs utilizing them. Occasionally, played around with langchain as well for prompt parameterizatio
n. Haven't fine tuned a model though.

**SQL:** Clear till joins and practicing more on LC.

**MongoDB:** Have set up a 
Cloud DB Atlas, used pymongo to connect and do CRUD in the DB.

**Docker, Git:** Have used both at work. Not Kubernetes 
tho.

&#x200B;

I have projects like django chat app, speech-to-text python script in resume. I also have have one simpl
e OCR app (3rd party api) (frontend streamlit, backend fastapi), containerized and hosted on GCP.

&#x200B;

Despite app
lying with referrals on LinkedIn, daily updating profiles on Naukri etc., tweaking CV according to JDs, cold mailing if 
possible, I haven't received any substantial offer yet. It's been \~5 months since I have been job-hunting. And I spend 
maybe 2-3 hours daily on Job Search.

&#x200B;

Is the market *really that bad?* Or because of my service based tag (90 
days notice period), companies are not even shortlisting the CV?

Say, If I learn a new tech stack (Cloud/Go/pySpark/Cyb
erSec), will no one hire me now even for fresher/entry level roles given my experience in WITCH?

&#x200B;

In my initia
l years, I thought since I have a good project, I will use it as a base to switch. However, actual meat of the dev work 
(whatever little was there) slowed down post POC phase, and after a while, only the mundane tasks remained. Now, roles w
ith 2+ YoE want experience in CI/CD, Redis caching, Kafka/RabbitMQ, Celery, ElasticSearch, AWS and what not. It's not li
ke I can't learn them but...

&#x200B;

I genuinely fear (and maybe feel overwhelmed) that by the time I catch up with t
hose things properly, I will have 3+ YoE and then the requirements will be even more stringent, and that way I will be p
erpetually left lagging behind.

I am ready to even take like 10-20% cut on my current CTC or offer to work for some wee
ks for free.

I am eager to put in the work even on weekdays, and absorb like sponge and hustle in the right direction, 
but I don't want to fill excel for the rest of my life and become like those folks whom I see at office. It freezes and 
scares me.

If you are into Backend Dev/Data or similar senior tech data roles, and have read so far, Thank You!!

&#x20
0B;

Do genuinely advice (or DM me if you can be kind enough to mentor me) on what can I do from here to make the most a
nd escape this cycle.

```
Hi, all!

I'm currently working with Langchain with a logic that will go through all PDFs with RetrievalQA asking a cert
ain query inside a loop (so n inferences every time).

The problem is, the bigger my retrieved chunks and prompt get, th
e more memory is allocated in my VRAM, and I only have 24GB available, and it oftens runs out with some of my testings.


Is there a way to prevent this amount of memory consumed through the loop? It seems to be that every retrieval call inc
rements more and more memory allocated. I've tried nesting my logic under torch.no\_grad() but no luck. I also have my P
YTORCH\_CUDA\_ALLOC\_CONF variable set to garbage\_collection\_threshold:0.6,max\_split\_size\_mb:128.

Thanks in advanc

I'm using a langchain script in order to make a similarity search of a query embedding in an embedding's MongoDb collect
ion but I want to pre filter the documents to search only in the documents that are $in an objectId array.

    // Get t
he list of embeddings _ids to preFilter
    const documentData =  await documentCollection.findOne(
      { '_id': docum
entId },
      { 'embededings': 1 }
    )
    const documentEmbeddingsId = documentData.embeddings
    
    
    
    //
 Embed query
    const query = 'What is this document about?'
    const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({
      modelN
ame:'XXX',
      openAIApiKey: 'XXX'
    })
    const embeddedQuery = await embeddings.embedQuery(query)
    
    
    

    // Similarity search
    const vectorStore = new MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch(embeddings, {
      collection,
      inde
xName: 'XXX',
      textKey: 'XXX', 
      embeddingKey: 'XXX', 
    });
    const preFilter = {
      preFilter: {
    
    _id: {
          $in: documentEmbeddingsId
        },
      },
    }
    const storingResponse = await vectorStore.s
imilaritySearchVectorWithScore(embeddedQuery,4,preFilter)
    

Running this code returns this error:

'Error: MongoServ
erError: Operand type is not supported for $vectorSearch: objectId'.

Is the error in the preFilter? Or is this type of 
filter not supported by mongodb? Any ideas on how I can make this search? The documentEmbeddings array has ObjectId type
. If I try to instead give a string array I get the following error: Error: MongoServerError: PlanExecutor error during

```
Hi,

I created a RAG app and now want to also use chat history in my application. All of my applications functionality i
s handled via a FastAPI backend, the frontend is in Streamlit. 

How can I now add chat history in my FastAPI RAG endpoi
nt? 

Is there a way to just save the chat history in a session? E.g. making a post endpoint where the history gets adde
d to the chain. Alternatively I have heard that Redis is a good choice but as for my understanding it is not open-source
 anymore. For me it would be important to have a open-source solution which is free and can run online.

&#x200B;

Thank
s in advance!

Hi all,
My document is a list of product code that matches a certain product name. Imagine there are 100 very similar ch
unks like this

Chunk1 :
Product code of ABC-123 = product A

Chunk2:
Product code of ABC-124 = product B

Chunk3:
Produ
ct code of ABC-125 = product C
…


Currently I transform the query ‘ABC-123’ into a question more similar to the chunk i
tself such as ´product code of ABC-XXX’. Then I 
use langchain default doc retriever for retrieving the chunk. But obvio
usly the embedding of the above chunk are extremely similar so the result is bad.

I then try using BM25 retriever but t
hen this retriever focus on the keyword ‘product code’ more instead of focusing on ´ABC-XXX’. Therefore, The result is e
ven worst with this BM25 retriever.

What are the idea or solution that can solve this problem? Thanks.

Is there an open-source project that can create high quality text from PDFs or Web Pages with little loss of quality?

I
 know there are a lot of projects that can do this but none that can handle everything like images, tables in those PDFs
 and Web Pages. For instance, we can use OCR/Image Captioning/Pix2Struct techniques to generate quality text and therefo
re embeddings from images. We can use similar techniques to convert tables to text and therefore embeddings.

Is there a
 framework that can do all of this out of the box? I know I'm asking for a lot here, but this seems like a problem that 
everyone who's doing RAG encounters everyday. I'm just wondering if there's anything out there before I spend time build
ing something myself.

What libraries or techniques do you use for generating quality embeddings?

Hello everyone,

I'm trying to integrate a LLM with Langchain, specifically using the create\_react\_agent function docu
mented here: [Langchain create\_react\_agent documentation](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/agents/langchain.
agents.react.agent.create_react_agent.html).

For this test, I am trying to work with the open-source FLAN model from Hu
gging Face, available at: [FLAN T5 XL on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xl/tree/main). My goal is t
o deploy this model as an endpoint in AWS SageMaker and then utilize it within Langchain by creating a react agent.

Wha
t steps should I follow to ensure that when I make a call to this SageMaker endpoint, it returns an LLM object that Lang
chain's create\_react\_agent function can utilize? Also, do not want to use SageMaker DLC images.

I'm unsure about the 
best practices for making the deployed model compatible as an LLM object for Langchain, especially in terms of the expec
ted response format and any necessary wrappers or adapters.

Can some one offer insights into:

1. The specific modifica
tions or configurations needed on the SageMaker side to ensure compatibility with Langchain.
2. How to properly format t
he SageMaker endpoint's response to be recognized as an LLM object by Langchain.
3. Any examples or templates that might
 be helpful for this process.  


If this is not possible with SageMaker, what are the other options that I can look int
o? 

Appreciate your help on this.

**Voyage AI** is the newest giant in the embedding, reranking, and search model game!

I am SUPER excited to publish our
 latest Weaviate podcast with Tengyu Ma, Co-Founder of Voyage AI and Assistant Professor at Stanford University!

We beg
an the podcast with a deep dive into everything embedding model training and contrastive learning theory. Tengyu deliver
ed a **masterclass** in everything from scaling laws to multi-vector representations, neural architectures, representati
on collapse, data augmentation, semantic similarity, and more! I am beyond impressed with Tengyu's extensive knowledge a
nd explanations of all these topics.

The next chapter dives into a case study Voyage AI did **fine-tuning an embedding 
model for the LangChain documentation.** This is an absolutely fascinating example of the role of continual fine-tuning 
with very new concepts (for example, very few people were talking about chaining together LLM calls 2 years ago), as wel
l as the data efficiency advances in fine-tuning.

We concluded by discussing ML systems challenges in serving an embedd
ings API. Particularly the challenge of detecting if a request is for batch or query inference and the optimizations tha
t go into either say \~100ms latency for a query embedding or maximizing throughput for batch embeddings.

I hope you fi
nd the podcast interesting, more than happy to discuss any of these topics with you or answer any questions about the co
ntent in the podcast! Thank you so much!
