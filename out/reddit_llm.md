```
I’ve recently gotten into AI agents, but I’m not sure where to start.

Some people say that frameworks like LangChain an
d LlamaIndex have too many abstractions and not great for production environments. I came across Pydantic AI, and it loo
ks interesting, but it’s new, so I’m not sure if it’s any good.

Others say frameworks are a waste of time and that the 
best way is to build everything from scratch.

What do you guys think I should do, and how can I learn this stuff?

Hi everyone, I'm new to Langchain and this is my first post here. I'm looking to write a script that compares informatio
n from a PDF file against data from a JSON file. The PDF is a one-page export from Adobe Illustrator, designed for produ
ct packaging, and the data is unstructured. I want to identify discrepancies between the two, including typos, differenc
es in values, upper/lower case differences, and spaces, and return coordinates of rectangles where are those erroros

Ca
n anyone recommend an approach for this task and share some tips and tricks? I'm just starting out with Langchain and wo
uld appreciate any guidance.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Greetings, I hope this space can help bring attention to an important issue. I kindly ask for your support in sharing th
is news: Francisco Angulo de Lafuente, known on Twitter as @**Francisco\_Ecofa**, won a hackathon organized by NVIDIA wi

This project introduces an innovative way to optimize neural network
s using light reflections and basic principles of quantum computing instead weigths. However, despite his outstanding ac

It’s crucial that this situation

Hi everyone,

I'm searching for a Python library that can help manage versioning and performance tracking of prompts loc
ally during development. Ideally, the system should:

* Run on localhost
* Save prompt metrics and versions in YAML or J
SON
* Provide a UI for creating and managing prompts
* Allow consuming the created prompts both through the UI and via c
ode

Does anyone know of an existing library that fits these requirements or have suggestions on how to implement this?

```
Hi all, some background: I'm a career switcher. Have an undergrad law degree from SOAS and an LLM from KCL (intellectual
 property law). 

Moved back to Singapore after graduating (not willingly, I couldn't get a training contract to qualify
 to practise English law, and this was when there was no graduate visa due to Theresa May reasons). I got qualled in Sin
gapore, practised commercial litigation for 3 years, realised I didn't like law very much, ditched it, learned to code, 


For some reason I did a data science bootcamp, then figured out I hated Jupyter notebooks, so I found a job as a data 
engineer. No idea how I convinced them that I could figure Scala out but 4 interviews later I got my current role as a S
cala Data Engineer and have been working in it for the last 9 months. 

I'm not exactly doing data engineering work per 
se, it's been all about building and maintaining a system for other data engineers to configure spark scala pipelines wi
th yaml/json and my code handles it (my fingers are still sore from the 300 pages of documentation). 

Recently, work fi
gured out I learned langchain when they weren't looking so they started getting me write python to throw AI into everyth
ing. I am having fun at work, but I'm looking ahead.

Separately, I do a bunch of random projects in my free time as wel
l, here's my personal GitHub:

https://github.com/Shredmetal

Here's where I'm at right now:

1. I want to move back to 
the UK, and honestly, while I can build a pile of stuff, my fundamentals in data structures and algorithms could use wor
k, like, a lot of work. I go play leetcode for fun when I'm not working on some project and pay for LC premium for edito
rials and explanations on how the solution works under the hood (python abstracts away a lot of stuff)

2. I suspect a l
ot of jobs are closed off to me because they see 'bootcamp' and go lol no.

3. I am considering a CS degree of some sort
. I'm not getting any younger, so a 3-year undergrad degree is out of the question.

4. Therefore, I'm wondering if a CS
 masters is the way forward, or if there are other computing degrees worth pursuing in order to actually seek employment
 in the UK.

Advice? Thanks!

```
Remember that simple AI chat template I shared earlier? Well, it just got a major upgrade! I'm excited to announce that 
we've added document chat capabilities (RAG) while keeping true to our core principle: keeping things simple and straigh
tforward.

What's New in v1.7.0:

# 🎉 Document Chat (RAG) Features:

https://preview.redd.it/g4aez3jjb79e1.png?width=255
4&format=png&auto=webp&s=f29ace8a181e210bbdd0766287c77556f4e002a2

* Chat with your documents using our simple RAG imple
mentation
* Upload PDFs and DOCX files with ease
* Smart document processing using LlamaCloud
* Vector storage with Pine
cone
* Interactive split-screen interface
* Click-to-navigate source references
* Contextual embeddings for improved rel
evancy

# 🚀 Core Features:

* Supabase Auth with SSR
* Multiple AI model support (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude AI Sonnet)
* Ef
ficient chat history with pagination
* Enhanced chat interface with streaming responses
* Document viewer with source hi
ghlighting

# 📑 Smart Document Processing Pipeline:

We've implemented a robust document processing flow that circumvent
s serverless function limitations:

1. Client directly uploads document to Supabase Storage
2. API route fetches the doc
ument from Supabase Storage and sends to LlamaCloud
3. Background polling checks LlamaCloud processing status every 10 s
econds
4. Once processing is complete, we:
   * Download processed markdown from LlamaCloud
   * Generate contextual emb
eddings
   * Store in Pinecone
   * Ready for semantic search and chat!

Why this approach? Serverless functions have a 
4.5MB payload limit, which can be restrictive for larger documents. By uploading directly to Supabase Storage first, we 
can handle documents of much larger size while maintaining a smooth user experience. However, there are still limits on 
how long a process can run. An example would be Cloudflare have a 100s cutoff timer. It is generally recommended to host
 your own server somewhere handle uploading using this.

auto=webp&s=abf6770a809b5f8baee8c3e81911fa096367cb83

Who It's For:

* Developers who need both chat and document QA cap
abilities
* Teams looking to build document-aware chatbots
* Anyone who wants to implement RAG without reaching for tool
s that overcomplicates everything ( I'm talking about you Langchain...)

The Goal: To provide a starting point for proje
cts that require authentication, AI chat, and document chat capabilities. It's completely free, as we don't believe in c
harging $299 for templates (looking at you, Shitfast).

Check out the project on GitHub: [https://github.com/ElectricCod
eGuy/SupabaseAuthWithSSR](https://github.com/ElectricCodeGuy/SupabaseAuthWithSSR)

Note: The project is functional and r
eady to use, but we're currently cleaning up the codebase and working on improving the documentation. If you'd like to c
ontribute, especially with the documentation or how-to guide in the README, feel free to jump in!

However
, I am not getting the expected output. This is the output I got:

`[]`

Instead of the expected output:

Does anyone know
 what might cause the model to not call the tool, resulting in an empty result.tool\_calls array?

Hello everyone, I'm reaching out for some help with two issues I'm experiencing with my AI models. As a novice user, ple
ase bear with me if my questions seem silly!

**Issue 1: Parsing Error with Llama 3.2**

I've noticed that when I use th
e Llama 3.2 model, I'm getting parsing errors. However, this issue doesn't seem to occur with the QWEN 2.5 coder. Can an
yone help me understand why this is happening?

**Issue 2: Colored Lines not Displaying**

I've noticed that the dotted 
lines connecting these models are not displaying in green color even after execution. Is there a setting or configuratio
n issue here? Any guidance on how to resolve this would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your help and 
patience!

ore* executing a tool call. This leads to multiple messages being sent for a single user query, which our current front-
end cannot handle.

For example:

* User: Detail for product A
* AI: let me search for you ... *<- this is the prelimina
ry/opening message I wanted to prevent*
* (AI executing tool)
* AI: Here is the detail for product A

**What I've Tried:
**

* I've tried adding instructions to the assistant prompt to refrain from sending any preliminary messages before too
l execution.
* I also added instruction to emphasize direct tool execution in the tool descriptions.

However, both of t
hese approaches not working as expected.

I want to ask are there any method in langgraph to prevent this? Thanks

all -  [ Diving into the Hype and Reality of AI Agent Frameworks - What Are People Saying? ](https://i.redd.it/35jmcq7f9t8e1.jpeg) , 2024-12-27-0913
```


I've been doing a deep dive into the burgeoning world of AI agent frameworks like Langchain, AutoGPT, and others, and 
wanted to share a summary of the user sentiment I've been picking up across the web, particularly here on Reddit and oth
er tech forums. It's a fascinating space, and the conversations are buzzing!

The Overall Vibe: A Mix of Excitement and 
Cautious Optimism

Generally, there's a strong sense of excitement and anticipation surrounding these frameworks. People
 are clearly intrigued by the potential of building truly autonomous AI agents that can reason, plan, and act in the rea
l world. The idea of AI handling complex tasks with minimal human intervention is definitely captivating.

The Good (Wha
t People Are Hyped About):

Automation Potential: This is the biggest draw. Users are excited about the possibilities of
 automating repetitive tasks, complex workflows, and even creative processes. Think coding assistants that go beyond sim
ple completions, personal research assistants, or even automated business processes.

Democratization of AI: Frameworks 
like Langchain, with their relatively accessible APIs and abstractions, are seen as tools that can empower developers (a
nd even technically savvy non-developers) to build sophisticated AI applications without needing a PhD in machine learni
ng.

Rapid Prototyping and Experimentation: These frameworks make it easier to quickly build and test out different agen
t architectures and workflows. The modular nature and pre-built components are a big plus for rapid iteration.

Novel Ap
plication Ideas: Discussions are brimming with creative ideas for how these agents could be used. From building personal
ized learning platforms to creating intelligent smart home ecosystems, the possibilities seem endless.

Integration with
 Powerful Models: The ability to easily integrate with powerful language models like GPT-3/4 and other specialized AI mo
dels is a major selling point. Users appreciate the ability to leverage state-of-the-art AI without having to train ever
ything from scratch.

Active Development and Community: Many frameworks have active and growing communities, which is a 
huge plus for troubleshooting, sharing ideas, and contributing to the development of the tools.

The Not-So-Good (Concer
ns and Skepticism):

Complexity and Learning Curve: While aiming for accessibility, many users find the frameworks compl
ex to get started with. Understanding the different components, chains, agents, and memory management can be challenging
, especially for beginners.

Debugging and Troubleshooting: When things go wrong, debugging these complex agent systems 
can be difficult. Understanding the flow of information and identifying the root cause of errors can be time-consuming.


Reliability and Consistency: A common concern is the reliability and consistency of these agents. Sometimes they work b
rilliantly, and other times they produce unexpected or nonsensical results. This unpredictability is a barrier for deplo
ying them in critical applications.

'Hallucinations' and Factuality: Because many of these frameworks rely on large lan
guage models, the issue of 'hallucinations' (generating incorrect or fabricated information) is a significant concern. U
sers are wary of relying on agents for tasks where factual accuracy is paramount.

Security Concerns: As these agents ga
in more autonomy and potentially access sensitive data or external tools, security becomes a major worry. Discussions ar
ound access control, sandboxing, and preventing malicious use are frequent.

Resource Intensive: Running complex agents 
can be computationally expensive, especially when interacting with powerful language models. Users are mindful of the co
st implications for development and deployment.

Ethical Considerations: The potential for misuse, bias, and unintended 
consequences with autonomous agents is a recurring theme in discussions. Users are grappling with the ethical implicatio
ns of deploying these powerful technologies.

The 'Demo vs. Reality' Gap: There's a feeling that some of the impressive 
demos don't always translate directly into real-world, robust applications. Bridging this gap is a key challenge.

The F
uture (Where People See This Going):

Despite the challenges, the overall sentiment is optimistic about the future of AI
 agent frameworks. Users believe that as the technology matures, these frameworks will become more reliable, easier to u
se, and capable of tackling increasingly complex problems. There's a sense of being on the cusp of a significant shift i
n how we interact with and leverage AI.

Key Takeaways from User Sentiment:

High potential, early stage: Everyone agree
s there's something powerful here, but it's still relatively early days.

Usability is key: Making these frameworks more
 accessible and easier to debug is crucial for wider adoption.

Focus on reliability and safety: Addressing the concerns
 around hallucinations, security, and ethical implications is paramount for building trust.

Practical applications are 
the goal: While the theoretical possibilities are exciting, users are eager to see more concrete examples of real-world 
value.

Complex multiple files rag
Hello, I'm working on a project related to build a streamlit chat application that allows use
rs ( project holders ) to boost their projects across different stages and help them prepare for presenting their projec
ts within a startup programm,  I have for this rag app , 40 pdfs ( 40 projects ) and a guide.pdf ( cookbook) , this guid
e shows the different stages and phases the project passes by and how to get financement and support from different enti
ties and banks, I used langchain + faiss + ollama + llama 3.2 + hugging face embedding for this project ( data is very p
rivate ) ! The app dosent work well since I want the assistant to follow the rules provided in the guide and consider th
e details of each project to guide the user since the user is a project owner while Leveraging the llama 3.2 capabilitie
s to suggest solution that matches the guide and stages and also to zoom on the corresponding project.
Thank you

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Minima: local conversational retrieval augmented generation project (Ollama, Langchain, FastAPI, ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1h1pudq/p_minima_local_conversational_retrieval_augmented/) , 2024-12-27-0913

Hey everyone, I would like to intro
duce you my latest repo, that is a local conversational rag on your files, Be honest, you can use this as a rag on-premi
ses, cause it is build with docker, langchain, ollama, fastapi, hf All models download automatically, soon I'll add an a
bility to choose a model For now solution contains:

* Locally running Ollama (currently qwen-0.5b model hardcoded, soon
 you'll be able to choose a model from ollama registry)
* Local indexing (using sentence-transformer embedding model, yo
u can switch to other model, but only sentence-transformers applied, also will be changed soon)
* Qdrant container runni
ng on your machine
* Reranker running locally (BAAI/bge-reranker-base currently hardcoded, but i will also add an abilit
y to choose a reranker)
* Websocket based chat with saving history
* Simple chat UI written with React
* As a plus, you 
can use local rag with ChatGPT as a custom GPT, so you able to query your local data through official chatgpt web and ma
c os/ios app.
* You can deploy it as a RAG on-premises, all containers can work on CPU machines

Couple of ideas/problem
s:

* Model Context Protocol support
* Right now there is no incremental indexing or reindexing
* No selection for the m
odels (will be added soon)
* Different environment support (cuda, mps, custom npu's)

Welcome to contribute (watch, fork
, star) Thank you so much!
