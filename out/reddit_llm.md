To
 answer some questions:

* Have not applied at all, so I do not know the current strength of the resume. When I do apply
, I want my resume to be as strong as possible. If I apply to Microsoft now for example, then I wouldn't be able to appl
y with a stronger resume later on (I think at least?)
* I do need work authorization to work in the US, but I do not nee
d sponsorship (can work on TN visa)
* My university is a target school for Amazon and Microsoft where I live, but I'm sp
ecifically seeking for US jobs (my girlfriend works in the US)
* My target is big tech preferably of course, and I do ha
ve connections with people and recruiters in US (and Canadian) offices of several FAANGs. However, I would really like t
o be able to make the resume strong enough that I do not need a referral, even though I will of course ask
* Not a diver
sity hire (neurodivergent yes (autism + ADHD), but gender and race no)
* My bullet points are accurate, but I am aware t
hey may seem not believable. I am considering dumbing them down intentionally to make them more believable. But I believ
e I would be able to explain any of them during an interview (e.g. 60% performance increase was because I was optimizing
 the work of a first-year intern who left prior to me joining). However, I am scared that the bullet points are so unbel
ievable that I wouldn't even be given the chance to explain myself
* The reason why I have technologies listed in bullet
 points or projects but not in technical skills is because I did use them in the job/project, but I wouldn't consider my
self strong enough to talk about the intricacies of that technology during an interview (e.g. Golang, Rust, Django which
 are mentioned in bullet points or projecs, but not in technical skills)
* I put it on there but the internship dates th
at started before university was during high school
* While doing all of the internships, I've been taking classes part-
time online. So half of my credits are from my university and the other half are from other universities. I didn't put t
his on there of course, but that is why my expected graduation date is still in 2025 despite interning since the start o
f 2023
* The reason why the project under the name 'Personal project' has so many technologies is because the backend co
nsists of a fork of a Ruby on Rails app which I had to modify, communicating with a Golang GraphQL API I am making, Fire
base is only for auth. gRPC is used to communicate between the Rails app and Golang app. GraphQL is used between the Rea

```
Hi, I'm a software developer with 5 years of experience. The languages and technologies that I have used at work are Per
l and Oracle SQL at backend, React.js and Typescript for front-end with most of the work at backend. I did not care abou
t the tech stack at first as the job was paying me well. However, now I'm stuck at applying to other companies and start
ed to upskill myself. 

I'm interested in Machine learning recently and completed ML, DL and AI courses in Udemy. I have
 also started learning about Gen AI using Langchain.

Colleagues at office are suggesting to do AWS certifications if pl
anning to stay in the same domain and PG or MS in Machine Learning to get into AI/ML domain.

On going through sites lik
e quora and reddit, many have suggested to improve the skills instead of spending lakhs on getting a degree or certifica
tion.
Can anyone suggest me how to improve my ML/AI skills and get a job in this domain? Is PG/MS needed?

Potentially dumb question lol. Basically when I run my RAG, it takes a long time to process all the documents that it wi
ll then retrieve. Is there a way to just save off the model after it is done reading the documents so that when you run 
it again, it can skip that step? Similar to how a fine-tuned model would work? It doesn't really make sense in my head, 
but I haven't been able to find a concrete answer to this so I want to be sure.

```
My question might be a bit basic, but I’m new to all of this and eager to learn.

I have a basic setup where I initializ
e an LLM using vLLM with Langchain RAG and the Llama model (specifically, llama2-13b-chat-hf). Here’s what I do:

* I de
fine a system prompt and an instruction f
* I create an `llm_chain`
* I then run the chain with `llm_chain.run(text)` , 
which works for a single input.

I have build an app with FastAPI. Previously I used asyncio method to handle multiple r
equest to llm, but with each new request it become slower in response. So I decide to use vLLM method, but I got a probl
em now how to provide parallel or concurrent requests to vLLM when I have dealing with dozen or more users. Is there a w
ay to call `run` in parallel for several inputs and receive valid results for each input?

```
Hi!

I'm working on a RAG system for my company where we can use it to search through our internal wiki page.  
My syste
m is nearly in a releasable state and finds the correct information 90% of the times, and I'm happy about it, but I'm co
nstantly thinking, can I make it better?

I've made a custom scraper for our wiki, we're using an older version of Media
Wiki.  
The scraper I've made is basically extracting all sections out into its own 'document' and then sending it into 
qdrant vector database.  
That means that in the vector database, it doesn't have a full wiki page but rather a cut up v
ersion to make it easier for the search query to hit something right. But I feel like this is kinda wrong?

Whenever you
 send in your query to the backend, it'll then search for the 10 documents matching and then reranking with BAAI/bge-rer
anker-large. Then the context is being sent to Llama3:8b with your question in mind.  
This means that Llama3 will never
 get a fully contextual article, since the vectors are only smaller sections from the full page.

What could be done do 
make this better in the end? The one thing I see as an issue here, is that it will never know anything about the rest of
 the full page, but if it has the full page, it feels like Llama3 get overwhelmed by the data and then craps out.

We ha
ve  \~258 articles and that's resulting in about 1488 points in qdrant.

Hey everyone,

I'm an MBBS medical doctor in the UK interested in transitioning into private equity down the line. I'm f
lexible with moving countries in the future.

Currently I'm completing my training, however, have dedicated 20 hours a w
eek to exploring this space.  
Relevant knowledge: 

- Cert: Advanced Valuation and Strategy - M&A, Private Equity, and 
VC.

---> easy to learn: Did Mathematics Extension 2 in schooling (Stats, Vectors, Matrices, Diff + Integration, Perms &
 Combs etc.) However need more weekly practice with DCF to solidify the knowledge to make it second nature.

- Good skil
ls with MS Office \~ Excel scripts needs solidification.

- Know Langchain, RAG, Python and familiar with open source LL
M works.

Familiar with crunchbase but don't have enough capital to fund it for longer unless justified.

Does anyone kn
ow where I can find remote, part time experiences or even mentors in private equity?

Really keen on learning and will w
ork for it.

```
Hi guys,

Are you also facing issues when using Ollama with Pydantic? It seems that the response from the LLM is often n
ot put in the output format as requested by Pydantic. Hence, the subsequent code in our program throws an error.

In our
 tests, we used Codestral-22B and the following function to call the LLM inference. We also tested the same with the API
 from Mistral, and this works. **So it seems there is a problem in the interface between Ollama and Pydantic.**



Do yo
u have good experience with Ollama and Pydantic? Do you know how we can solve this?

Many thanks for your help!

Pseudo 
code (not functional, just to show which functions we call)

    from langchain_experimental.llms.ollama_functions impor
t OllamaFunctions
    
    llm = OllamaFunctions(base_url=Config.HOST_LLM, temperature=0, model='codestral:latest', form
at='json')
    
    llm = llm.with_structured_output(MyPydanticOutputClass)
    
    llm.invoke({...}) # pass data requi
red by the LLM to perform inference 

---- 

We are using Pydantic through the call **with\_structured\_output:**

**llm
.with\_structured\_output(MyPydanticOutputClass)**

So, sometimes there are some fields of the Pydantic object that are 
not parsed, so the output of the LLM is incomplete, for example:

***Got: 3 validation errors for CodeGenerationOutput**
*

***dev\_mode***

***field required (type=value\_error.missing)***

***rtos***

***field required (type=value\_error.m
issing)***

***is\_func\_empty***

And sometimes producing a more general error:

***raise ValueError(***  
***ValueErro
r: Failed to parse a response from codestral-latest output: {}***

Langchain async for document loader and character splitter

Should I use Async or not? 

I am building a Fast api RAG 
app that uses LLMs to generate responses using langchain but I am confused if it needs async. 

The user flow goes somet
hing like this:
1. User provides a link/ links to a text/pdf document in the form of a url.  
2. Langchain document load
ers are used to load text or pdf from the remote public url.
3. Character splitter is used to split and chunk the docume
nts which is saved into a vector db. 
4. Langchain chain library is used to invoke LLMs via the asynchronous ainvoke(). 


My question is whether the document loading step via langchain and character splitting text via langchain  would need 
to be made async? Langchain doesn’t support async for the libraries I am using. Would I need to implement them myself? I
f so, what are some options to implement?

Hi,

  
I set up Mixtral 8x22B on Azure AI/Machine Learning and now want to use it with Langchain. I have difficulties w
ith the format I am getting, e.g. a ChatOpenAI response looks like this:

    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
  
  llmm = ChatOpenAI()
    llmm.invoke('Hallo')

  
`AIMessage(content='Hallo! Wie kann ich Ihnen helfen?', response_meta
data={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 8, 'prompt_tokens': 8, 'total_tokens': 16}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 's
ystem_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='r')`

This is how it looks when I am loading M
ixtral 8x22B with AzureMLChatOnlineEndpoint:

    from langchain_community.chat_models.azureml_endpoint import AzureMLCh
atOnlineEndpoint
    
    from langchain_community.chat_models.azureml_endpoint import (
        AzureMLEndpointApiType,

        CustomOpenAIChatContentFormatter,
    )
    from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
    
    chat = Az
ureMLChatOnlineEndpoint(
        endpoint_url='...',
        endpoint_api_type=AzureMLEndpointApiType.dedicated,
       
 endpoint_api_key='...',
        content_formatter=CustomOpenAIChatContentFormatter(),
    )
    
    chat.invoke('Hallo
')

  
`BaseMessage(content='Hallo, ich bin ein deutscher Sprachassistent. Was kann ich für', type='assistant', id='run-
23')`



So with the Mixtral model the output seems to be truncated and also the format is different (BaseMessage vs. AI
Message). How can I change this to make it work just like an ChatOpenAI model?

  
In my application I want to easily sw
itch between these two models.

Hi there,

I am currently working on building a chatbot for internal use in my company. I have developed a relatively c

sed about how to actually 'activate' a graph in the RAG flow.

So far, I have found different approaches based on extrac
ting entities and relationships from chunks to generate community summaries of the related entities. This process occurs
 in the offline stage. At least, that is what I have tried to do. I am wondering how to activate this correctly. Current
ly, I match entities from the input with summaries as the flow runs, but I have the impression that others use the graph
 aspect differently, possibly using a function to inject relevant context into the LLM.

Can you help me understand this
 better?

I'm trying to build reusable chains and I'm having issues trying to set it up so it takes the output of the previous cha
in as one of the template format arguments.

In this example, I have a chain that generates a title based on a topic and
 a chain that translates the title into a different language. The topic and the language I want to provide them when I i
nvoke the final chain.

If my 2nd chain only has one single input for the template (because I hardcode the language), ev
erything works perfectly:

    # Title Chain
    title_template = PromptTemplate.from_template('Generate a title for a b
log post about the following topic: {topic}')
    generate_title = title_template | llm | StrOutputParser()
    
    # T
ranslate Chain
    translate_template = PromptTemplate.from_template('Translate the following text to spanish: {text}')

    translate_chain = translate_template | llm | StrOutputParser()
    
    # Combine and run
    combined_chain = gener
ate_title | translate_chain
    result = combined_chain.invoke({'topic': 'The benefits of exercise'})

But if I want to 
be able to provide the language when I invoke the final chain then, I dont know how to pass the output to the template d
ictionary. See the 'HOW\_TO\_PASS\_OUTPUT\_OF\_PREVIOUS\_CHAIN' in the code

    # Title Chain
    title_template = Prom
ptTemplate.from_template('Generate a title for a blog post about the following topic: {topic}')
    generate_title = tit
le_template | llm | StrOutputParser()
    
    # Translate Chain
    translate_template = PromptTemplate.from_template('
Translate the following text to {language}: {text}')
    translate_chain = {'language': itemgetter('language'), 'text': 
HOW_TO_PASS_OUTPUT_OF_PREVIOUS_CHAIN?} | translate_template | llm | StrOutputParser()
    
    # Combine and run
    com
bined_chain = generate_title | translate_chain
    result = combined_chain.invoke({'topic': 'The benefits of exercise', 
'language': 'Spanish'})

  
I also tried to use a lambda function but the itemgetter doesn't seem to work:

    translat
e_chain = (
        lambda text: {'language': itemgetter('language'), 'text': text}
        | translate_template
       
 | llm
        | StrOutputParser()
    )

  
If anyone knows the answer I would be much appreciated.

Word cl
ouds, vector databases, reducemap like in langchain, etc., etc.

Any other ideas of how to approach this?

My goal is to
 create a summary of each book then vectorize that and create a semantic search engine for my books. Maybe I could make 
an online version if it's good enough.

EDIT: Using gemini-1.5-flash seems good enough, however using pro,

What I'm doing is summarizing the book in chapters, sending them to 1.5-flash which is free. Then
 for the next chapter sending the previous summary + the chapter, and so on. This yields a consistent result with good m

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Seeking Feedback on My GenAI Job Fit Project - New to LangChain/LangGraph ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1dgns9p/p_seeking_feedback_on_my_genai_job_fit_project/) , 2024-07-06-0910

Hi all,

Soo, i have been working on a a projectcalled [GenAI Job Fit](https://github.com/DAVEinside/GenAI_Job_Fit). It'
s an AI-driven system designed to enhance job applications by providing tailored recommendations based on individual pro
files.

I'm relatively new to LangChain and LangGraph, and I've incorporated them into this project. I would greatly app
reciate it if you could check out the repository and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Your insights
 on how I can better implement LangChain/LangGraph, or any other aspect of the project, would be incredibly valuable. I'
m eager to learn and make this project as robust as possible.

Thank you in advance for your time and feedback!

MachineLearning -  [ [P] I'm tired of LangChain, so I made a simple open-source alternative with support for tool using a ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1deffo8/p_im_tired_of_langchain_so_i_made_a_simple/) , 2024-07-06-0910

[https://github.com/piEsposito/tiny-ai-client](https://github.com/piEsposito/tiny-ai-client)

The motivation for buildin
g tiny-ai-client comes from a frustration with Langchain, that became bloated, hard to use and poorly documented - and t
akes inspiraton from [simpleaichat](https://github.com/minimaxir/simpleaichat/tree/main), but adds support to vision, to
ols and more LLM providers aside from OpenAI (Gemini, Anthropic - with Groq and Mistral on the pipeline.)

I'm building 
this to to continue what simpleaichat started and not to ride on hype, raise money or whatever, but to help people do 2 
things: build AI apps as easily as possible and switching LLMs without needing to use Langchain.

This is a minimally vi
able version of the package, with support to vision, tools and async calls. There are a lot of improvements to be done, 
but even at its current state, tiny-ai-client has generally improved my interactions with LLMs and has been used in prod
uction with success.

Let me know what you think: there are still a few bugs that may need fixing, but all the examples 
work and are easy to be be adapted to your use case.

deeplearning -  [ Llama 3 not running on GPU ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1dptxsr/llama_3_not_running_on_gpu/) , 2024-07-06-0910
```
I dont know much theory about RAG but i need to implement it for a project.  
**I want to run llama3 on my GPU to get fa
ster results.**

`from langchain_community.llms import Ollama`  
`llm = Ollama(model='llama3',num_gpu=1)`  
`def generat
e_response(prompt, similar_jobs):`  
`descriptions = '\n\n'.join([job['Description'] for job in similar_jobs])`  
`augme
nted_prompt = f'{prompt}\n\nHere are some job recommendations based on your query:\n{descriptions}'`  
`for chunks in ll
m.stream(augmented_prompt):`  
`print(chunks, end='')`

I am giving llama3 my *'user prompt'* and top 5 nearest *'simila
r\_jobs'* using cosine similarity.  
This code goes not use my GPU but my CPU and RAM usage is high.

**My gpu usage is 
0%** , i have a Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Laptop GPU GDDR6 @ 4GB (128 bits)

Can someone guide me to some resource how can I finetune an open source llm or some library (like langchain) on unstruct
ured data (example: news articles on cricket) So that model can answer a question (like When did India won world Cup?)
