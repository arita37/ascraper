```
Hey everyone!

I’m a new NLP intern at a company, working on building a completely local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Genera
tion) application. The data I’m working with is extremely sensitive and can’t leave my system, so everything—LLM, embedd
ings—needs to stay local. No exposure to closed-source companies is allowed.

I initially tested with a sample dataset (
not sensitive) using Gemini for the LLM and embedding, which worked great and set my benchmark. However, when I switched
 to a fully local setup using Ollama’s Llama 3.1:8b model and sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2, I ran into two big
 issues:

1. The documents extracted aren’t as relevant as the initial setup (I’ve printed the extracted docs for multip
le queries across both apps). I need the local app to match that level of relevance.

2. Inference is painfully slow (\\
\~5 min per query). My system has 16GB RAM and a GTX 1650Ti with 4GB VRAM. Any ideas to improve speed?

I would apprecia
te suggestions from those who have worked on similar local RAG setups! Thanks!

```
There is [a topic about building an agent](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/agents/) in LangChain docs. It sa
ys that the following code:

    from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
    from langch
ain_core.messages import HumanMessage
    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
    
    search = TavilySearchResults(
max_results=2)
    tools = [search]
    model = ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4')
    model_with_tools = model.bind_tools(tools)

    response = model_with_tools.invoke([HumanMessage(content='Hi!')])
    print(f'ContentString: {response.content}')
 
   print(f'ToolCalls: {response.tool_calls}')

prints out this:

    ContentString: Hello!
    ToolCalls: []

but if rep
lace 'Hi!' with 'What's the weather in SF?'

    response = model_with_tools.invoke([HumanMessage(content='What's the we
ather in SF?')])

i get this:

    contentstring:
    ToolCalls: [{'name': 'tavily_search_results_json', 'args': {'query
': 'weather san francisco'}, 'id': 'toolu_01VTP7DUvSfgtYxsq9x4EwMp'}]

As you can see, the decision whether to use the t
ool or not is made automatically depending on the prompt.

So my question is how is it implemented? I assume that there 
is some sentence transformer which translates the tool description into embeddings, then translates my promt into embedd
ings with the same sentence transformer and put those embeddings into some local vector data base. And if the distance b
etween my prompt and the description is small then LangChain decides to use the tool. Am i right? If it so, what exactly
 sentence transformer is used ?

all -  [ Built a web agent which call fill Google forms based on the user details [P] ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fozud5/built_a_web_agent_which_call_fill_google_forms/) , 2024-09-26-0912
```
GitHub repo : [https://github.com/shaRk-033/web-agent](https://github.com/shaRk-033/web-agent)

Tried to solve it using 
two approaches:

# 1: Basic Scraping and Filling

This is the straightforward approach. The agent scrapes the form’s HTM
L and uses fixed XPaths to find and fill in the required fields.

* It pulls the form’s HTML, locates the fields with se
t XPaths, and inputs the answers. It’s a direct and simple method.
* If the form changes or an element isn’t where it’s 
expected, the process can fail and may need manual adjustments.

[basic approach](https://preview.redd.it/5e8g4a1k4xqd1.
png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8e984e4feaee2f0453b08c8696768c40a2a5c20)

2. Using LangChain Agents and tool call
ing

* LangChain Agent**:** The agent handles everything by using the LLM’s reasoning to decide what to do next, includi
ng generating those tricky XPaths.
* Error Handling**:** If something goes wrong (like an element not found), the agent 
tries again with better XPaths until it gets the job done.

I plan to expand this significantly in
 the upcoming months and am looking at adding many more features. 

I want to understand if it would be better bet to sw

I am from a startup with limited resources.
However, I am seeing that lambdas have cold st

Another thing to consider is, our

As this is a 1:1 migration you get the benefit of having a predefined scope with a predict
ably workload. The backend logic uses a couple of LLM-related tasks using LangChain / OpenAI ChatCompletion API but can 
be re-used as backend should stay within Python.

It somehow feels like most companies use LLMs not as product of it's own but rather as tool for solv

Like parsing unstructured data to structured one, auto classification tasks a

Does your company have different production ready use cases?

Hey everyone,

I'm a math major at the University of Chicago, and I'm interested in helping my school with academic sche
duling. I want to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that can assist students in planning their academ
ic schedules. The chatbot should be able to understand course prerequisites, course times, and the terms in which course
s are offered. For example, it should provide detailed advice on the courses listed in our mathematics department catalo
g: [University of Chicago Mathematics Courses](http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/mathematics/).

This projec
t boils down to building a reliable RAG chatbot. I'm wondering if anyone knows any RAG techniques or services that could
 help me achieve this outcome—specifically, creating a chatbot that can inform users about course prerequisites, schedul
es, and possibly the requirements for the bachelor's track.

Could the solution involve structuring the data in a specif
ic way? For instance, scraping the website and creating a separate file containing an array of courses with their prereq
uisites, schedules, and quarters offered.

Overall, I'm very keen on building this chatbot because I believe it would be
 valuable for me and my peers. I would appreciate any advice or suggestions on what I should do or what services I could
 use.

Thank you!

Hi guys, how are you plotting charts or graphs? Currently, I am using structured output and sending it to the frontend t

I've seen [chat2plot](https://github.com/nyanp/chat2plot) use a dataframe with the data, quer
ying it from the LLM and then structuring the output, but it only uses the dataframe to plot the chart. The LLM never di
rectly accesses that data.

In my current approach, I get the data from an API and then pass it to the LLM, which format
s the data and the structure for the chart. However, this is currently slow.

What approach do you recommend for handlin

- Data analysis, AI, ML tools such as: DuckDB, AutoGluon, AutoViz,
 GenSim, etc.
- Monitoring and Logging tools such as: Elastic Search, Kibana, Grafana, Prometheus.

A few sample use cas
es are:
- Use pre-made prompt templates and the provided Simple Chat Streamlit application to generate initial codes for
 R&D projects in any language.
- Use the provided 'Chat with Local Folder' to interact with multiple documents stored in
 a local folder for research and learning purposes.
- Use Jupyter Lab and the provided Jupyter Notebooks to learn and ex
periment with cutting edge topics such as Graph-based Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG), other advanced RAG technique
s, knowledge graph algorithms, and so on.
- Use Jupyter Lab and the installed AutoML, AutoViz packages to efficiently ex

```
For the past year, I’ve been building production systems using LLMs. When I started back in August 2023, materials were 
so scarce that many wheels had to be reinvented first. As of today, things have changed, yet the community is still in d
ire need of educational materials, especially from a production perspective.



Lots of people talk about LLMs, but very
 few actually apply them to their users/business.



Here is my new contribution to the community, “[The Essential Guide
 to Large Language Model’s Structured Output, and Function Calling](https://pavelbazin.com/post/the-essential-guide-to-l
arge-language-models-structured-output-and-function-calling?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=structured_
output&utm_content=sub_langchain)” article.



It is a hands-on guide (long one) on structured output and function calli
ng, and how to apply them from 0 to 1. Not much of requirements, just some basic Python, the rest is explained.



I had
 quite a bit of success applying it at the company to the initiative “Let's solve all customer support issues via LLMs f
or 200K+ users.” We haven’t hit 100% of the goal yet, but we are getting there fast, and structured output in particular
 is what made it possible for us.



Spread the word, and let’s share more on our experience of applied LLMs beyond demo
s.

  
*Note: article does not use LangChain or any other frameworks, it rather encourages you to understand how LangCha
in does things under the hood, and why you might need it, or not.*

```
So, let's say I have a large number of sentences (30,000).

I want to perform a task so that I get an output for each of
 them, but I can only make 250 requests every minute (Sonnet 3.5 in Amazon Bedrock). This means 2 hours and it's too lon
g.

My idea is a batch approach, with e.g. 100 samples each batch.

With the batch I input the sentences with <sentence>
\[sentence\]</sentence> and tell the LLM to do the same, with an appropriate example.

Now I make 40 requests at the sam
e time, which take 1 minute to complete. This brings down the time to 30,000 / (40 \* 100) \* 1 = 7.5 minutes.

Sadly, t
he output for some of the batches doesn't have 100 <sentence></sentence>, but 99, 98, or whatever. When this happens, I 
have to discard the whole batch.

I've tried LangChain and Pydantic classes but it only worked with 10 examples/batch or
 so, so I need another approach.

**TLDR:** Single LLM call, get n inputs, n outputs, all ordered, no skipping

Creating a Test Automation App using OpenAI, Streamlit, and LangChain offers a groundbreaking way to improve software te
sting processes. This approach integrates the power of AI with simple-to-use tools, making it accessible to all team mem
bers while enhancing efficiency.

The development process begins by obtaining an OpenAI API key to access the language m
odels necessary for generating intelligent responses. Next, you set up a coding environment, adding essential libraries 
like Streamlit, OpenAI, and LangChain. With these components in place, the actual coding process starts. You create a Py
thon file (e.g., streamlit\_app.py), import the necessary libraries, and set up the user interface where users can input
 prompts and receive AI-generated test cases.

Deploying the app is simple with GitHub and Streamlit Community Cloud, ma
king it easy for others to use the app once it's live. The combination of low-code, AI-powered solutions enables efficie
nt test automation, cutting down maintenance time, and increasing test reliability.

By leveraging this technology, team
s can break down traditional silos, allowing developers, testers, and product managers to collaborate in creating robust

```
Hi everyone,

I'm working on creating an agent that assists with market research on companies. The goal is to allow user
s to ask questions like:

* 'What is the revenue of Company X?'
* 'What is the pricing of Service Y from Company Z?'

To
 accomplish this, I've been using the `bindtools` function to connect different tools to the agent. Each tool is special
ized—for example:

* **Pricing Tool**: Scrapes company websites where pricing information is likely found.
* **Revenue T
ool**: Searches specific websites that typically display company revenue figures.

However, as I add more tools, I've no
ticed that sometimes the agent doesn't call the correct tool. I suspect this might be due to overlapping tool descriptio
ns or limitations in how `bindtools` handles tool selection.

I'm considering an alternative approach:

1. **Option 1**:
 **Continue using** `bindtools`, possibly refining tool descriptions to improve accuracy.
2. **Option 2**: **Implement a
 Router LLM Node using LangGraph**:
   * Use an LLM node to read the user's query and determine the category (e.g., reve
nue, pricing, team).
   * Output the category and use `add_conditional_edge` to direct the query to the appropriate node
.
   * In this setup, tools wouldn't use decorators but would be functions represented as nodes.

My questions to the co
mmunity are:

* **Which of these two options is better for ensuring accurate tool selection as I scale up?**
* **Are the
re other strategies or best practices that might suit my use case even better?**

Any insights or experiences you can sh
are would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance for your help!

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Swapping Embedding Models for an LLM ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fktvbj/p_swapping_embedding_models_for_an_llm/) , 2024-09-26-0912
```
How tightly coupled is an embedding model to a language model?

Taking an example from Langchain's tutorials, they use O
llama's _nomic-embed-text_ for embedding and _Llama3.1_ for the understanding and Q/A. I don't see any documentation abo
ut Llama being built on embeddings from this embedding model. 

Intuition suggests that a different embedding model may 
produce outputs of other sizes or produce a different tensor for a character/word, which would have an impact on the res
ults of the LLM. So would changing an embedding model require retraining/fine-tuning the LLM as well?

I need to use a e
mbedding model for code snippets and text. Do I need to find a specialized embedding model for that? If yes, how will ll
ama3.1 ingest the embeddings?

Ok, so I am currently trying to build support chatbot with following technicalities 
1. FastAPI for web server(Need to m

2. Qdrant as Vector Data Base(Found it to be the fastest amongst Chromadb, Elastic Search and Milvus)
3. 
MongoDB for storing all the data and feedback.
4. Semantic chunking with max token limit of 512.
5. granite-13b-chat-v2 
as the LLM(I know it's not good but I have limited options available)
6. The data is structured as well as unstructured.
 Thinking of having involving GraphRAG with current architecture.
7. Multiple data sources stored in multiple collection
s of vector database because I have implemented an access control.
8. Using mongoengine currently as a ORM. If you know 
something better please suggest.
9. Using all-miniLM-l6-v2 as vector embedding currently but planning to use stella_en_4
00M_v5.
10. Using cosine similarity to retrieve the documents.
11. Using BLEU, F1 and BERT score for automated evaluatio
n based on golden answer.
12. Using top_k as 3.
13. Currently using basic question answering prompt but want to improve 
it. Any tips? Also heard about Automatic Prompt Evaluation.
14. Currently using custom code for everything. Looking to u
se Llamaindex or Langchain for this. 
15. Right now I am not using any AI Agent, but I want to know your opinions. 
16. 
It's a simple RAG framework and I am working on improving it.
17. I haven't included reranker but I am planning to do so
 too.

I think I mentioned pretty much everything I am using for my project. So please share your suggestions, comments

```
I want to implement a Code-RAG system on a code directory where I need to:

* Parse and load all the files from folders 
and subfolders while excluding specific file extensions.
* Embed and store the parsed content into a vector store.
* Ret
rieve relevant information based on user queries.

However, I’m facing two major challenges:

**File Parsing and Loading
:** What’s the most efficient method to parse and load files in a hierarchical manner (reflecting their folder structure
)? Should I use Langchain’s directory loader, or is there a better way? I came across the Tree-sitter tool in Claude-dev
’s repo, which is used to build syntax trees for source files—would this be useful for hierarchical parsing?

**Cross-Fi
le Context Retrieval:** If the relevant context for a user’s query is spread across multiple files located in different 
subfolders, how can I fine-tune my retrieval system to identify the correct context across these files? Would reranking 
resolve this, or is there a better approach?

**Query Translation:** Do I need to use Something like Multi-Query or RAG-
Fusion to achieve better retrieval for hierarchical data?

\[I want to understand how tools like [continue.dev](http://c
ontinue.dev/) and [claude-dev](https://github.com/saoudrizwan/claude-dev) work\]

Are Agents just simple rules? Are Agents just enhanced reasoning? The answer is yes and no. Yes, in the sens
e that agents have simple rules and can sometimes enhance reasoning capabilities compared to a single prompt. But No in 
the sense that agents can have a much more diverse functionality like using specific tools, summarizing, or even followi
ng a particular style. In this blog, we look into how to set up these agents in a hierarchal manner just like running a 
small team of Authors, researchers, and supervisors.

**TextGrad
**. It is a powerful framework performing automatic “differentiation” via text. **It backpropagates textual feedback pro
vided by LLMs to improve individual components of a compound AI system.** In this framework, LLMs provide rich, general,
 natural language suggestions to optimize variables in computation graphs, ranging from code snippets to molecular struc
tures. TextGrad showed effectiveness and generality across various applications, from question-answering and molecule op
timization to radiotherapy treatment planning.

guys/textgrad-controlling-llm-behavior-via-text-2a82e2073d10?sk=3633a9aa63b884c97469bce659265921)

The addition of RAG t
o LLMs was an excellent idea. It helped the LLMs to become more specific and individualized. Adding new components to an
y system leads to more interactions and its own sets of problems. Adding RAG to LLMs leads to several problems such as h
ow to retrieve the best content, what type of prompt to write, and many more.

In this blog, we are going to combine the
 **LangChain RAG with DSPy**. We deep dive into how to evaluate the RAG pipeline quantitatively using **RAGAs** and how 
to create a system where instead of manually tweaking prompts, we let the system figure out the best prompt.

As the field of natural language processing (NLP) advances, the evaluation of large language
 models (LLMs) like GPT-4 becomes increasingly important and complex. Traditional metrics such as accuracy are often ina
dequate for assessing these models’ performance because they fail to capture the nuances of human language. In this arti
cle, we will explore why evaluating LLMs is challenging and discuss effective methods like BLEU and ROUGE for a more com
prehensive evaluation.

and AI-enabled video games face no obligation under the AI Act, but companies can voluntarily adopt additional codes of 
conduct.
* **Specific transparency risk:** systems like chatbots must clearly inform users that they are interacting wit
h a machine, while certain AI-generated content must be labelled as such.
* **High risk:** high-risk AI systems such as 
AI-based medical software or AI systems used for recruitment must comply with strict requirements, including risk-mitiga
tion systems, high-quality of data sets, clear user information, human oversight, etc.
* **Unacceptable risk:** for exam
ple, AI systems that allow “social scoring” by governments or companies are considered a clear threat to people’s fundam
ental rights and are therefore banned.

# California AI bill SB-1047 sparks fierce debate, Senator likens it to ‘Jets vs. Sharks’ feud


**Key Aspects of SB-1047:**

* Regulation Scope: Targets “frontier” AI models, defined by their immense computational t
raining requirements (over 10²⁶ operations) or significant financial investment (>$100 million).
* Compliance Requiremen
ts: Developers must implement safety protocols, including the ability to immediately shut down, cybersecurity measures, 
and risk assessments, before model deployment.
* Whistleblower Protections: Encourages reporting of non-compliance or ri
sks by offering protection against retaliation.
* Safety Incident Reporting: Mandates reporting AI safety incidents with
in 72 hours to a newly established Frontier Model Division.
* Certification: Developers need to certify compliance, pote
ntially under penalty of perjury in earlier drafts, though amendments might have altered this.

**Pros:**

* Safety Firs
t: Prioritizes the prevention of catastrophic harms by enforcing rigorous safety standards, potentially safeguarding aga
inst AI misuse or malfunction.
* Incentivizes Responsible Development: By setting high standards for AI model training, 
the company encourages developers to think critically about the implications of their creations.
* Public Trust: Enhance
s public confidence in AI by ensuring transparency and accountability in the development process.

**Cons:**

* Innovati
on Stagnation: Critics argue it might stifle innovation, especially in open-source AI, due to the high costs and regulat
ory burdens of compliance.
* Ambiguity: Some definitions and requirements might be too specific or broad, leading to leg
al challenges or unintended consequences.
* Global Competitiveness: There’s concern that such regulations could push AI 
development outside California or the U.S., benefiting other nations without similar restrictions.
* Implementation Chal
lenges: The practicalities of enforcing such regulations, especially the “positive safety determination,” could be compl
ex and contentious.

# MORE OpenAI drama

OpenAI co-founder John
 Schulman has left the company to join rival AI startup Anthropic, while OpenAI president and co-founder Greg Brockman i
s taking an extended leave until the end of the year. Schulman, who played a key role in creating the AI-powered chatbot
 platform ChatGPT and led OpenAI’s alignment science efforts, stated his move was driven by a desire to focus more on AI
 alignment and hands-on technical work. Peter Deng, a product manager who joined OpenAI last year, has also left the com
pany. With these departures, only three of OpenAI’s original 11 founders remain: CEO Sam Altman, Brockman, and Wojciech 
Zaremba, lead of language and code generation.
