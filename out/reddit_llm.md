Hey,  


We just published a playground to help developers test out different pre-processing configurations for their da
ta. This includes loaders, selectors and splitters. It uses parts of Langchain as well as some custom loaders and splitt
ers built by Neum AI. (All open source) Feel free to try it out here: [https://neumai-playground.streamlit.app/](https:/

```
 

I'm currently working on a project to give a quick summary of long articles/conversations.

I'm running llama-2-7b-ch
at-hf with 4bit quantization on a g5.2xlarge instance on sagemaker.

The method I'm using is map\_reduce (option 2)from 
this webpage [https://python.langchain.com/docs/use\_cases/summarization](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/su
mmarization))

Of everything I've tried this is the only one that's been able to do decent summaries in a reasonable amo
unt of time. However with really long articles (10,000+ words) it takes \~6 minutes before giving an output.

I tried ru
nning this same thing on a g5.12xlarge instance which has 4 A10G gpus but it hasn't reduced the time by any noticeable a
mount.

Is there anything else I could be doing to speed this up?

Hi Everyone,

As someone with a fulltime job and not that great coding skills its been difficult to ever get out a worki
ng side project. I recently joined buildspace season 4 - a 6 week online building challenge - and finally managed to get
 this over the line. Only have a handful of users and not really sure if this product is super useful so would love to h
ave some feedback.

**What is it:** A very simple and easy to use AI document editor that uses GPT-4 to generate text an
d images. The text generated is based off your previous text and documents so theoritcally it should be in your own voic
e.

**The idea behind it:** I wanted to start to reimagine documents and what they can be used for. Right now my project
 is only really useful for writing related tasks, but my idea in the beginning was to always include AI agents somehow t
o make documents 'alive' and complete tasks for you while youre away. If you're interested in that kind of stuff do foll
ow my journey to continue building this on twitter ([www.twitter.com/thetansen](https://www.twitter.com/thetansen)).

**
The tech:** Its using nextJs 13 but still using the pages directory as I've built this off of Vercels Platforms template
 which you can find here ([https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/platforms-starter-kit](https://vercel.com/templates/next
.js/platforms-starter-kit)), so it became a bit of a mismatch. For calling gpt4 im using langchain to call gpt-4  and pi
necone as my vector db to hold all the document data to pass in.For the text editor I'm using editorJS.

Hi everyone! 

I'm still experiencing with my own implementation of rag, and I deployed my custom chunking function (hon
estly don't like the methods on LangChain) . 

Anyway, I'm searching for alternative methods, algoritms (NLP or not) and
 models... There are lots of info and different implementation on RAG, but as I can see noone put much effort to augment
 chunking quality. 

Also, there are other approach than this one I'm currently using? bi-encoder (instructor) - > cross
-encoder (reranking) - > LLM 


Can someone share some resources, repo, lib or existing implementation of different chun
king methods?

all -  [ The rollercoaster journey behind launching the HelpKit AI Notion Chatbot ](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/16imj0g/the_rollercoaster_journey_behind_launching_the/) , 2023-09-15-0909
```
Hey folks!

Today I want to talk with you about the journey behind launching HelpKit AI. It wasn't a smooth sailing! 

H
elpKit is a solo founded and fully bootstrapped SaaS tool that turns your Notion docs into a professional help center an
d documentation site.

Since HelpKit is already hosting hundreds of customers Notion knowledge bases it only made sense 
to supercharge them with a custom AI trained chatbot. So far the results have been amazing.

And now, we just finally [l
aunched today on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/helpkit-ai) as well! The public beta is out since two w
eeks and we have onboarded more than 15 customers on the add-on and the AI bot held 2000+ successful conversations.The l
aunch was planned two months ago but some things stopped me from releasing it.

If you are curious about the background,
 here it is. Let me explain why the journey to the launch was a bit rougher than expected. There were two big issues: Th
e UX and building on top of AI.

&#x200B;

**The UX Hurdle**

First and foremost, I was stuck with developing a great us
er experience. I have only come across a handful of products that were sort of implementing the same concept and I reall
y did not like their UX implementation. Everything felt clunky and just did not fit into the concept of an AI enabled kn
owledge base system.

You see our AI chatbot needs to be integrated into HelpKit’s two layouts: Help Center and Document
ation and also work well on the widget and mobile.Quite a tricky task to get right everywhere! I brainstormed for a few 
days, tried out some implementations but none of them felt natural for a user in my opinion.

I even spent a whole week 
building an interface only to then throw away the entire feature code branch and start from scratch.What I needed was a 
break. So I took a weekend break, spent some time at the beach and came back refreshed with some new ideas (that strange
ly all came to me during my Sunday evening shower).

I realised that the most intuitive way to present the option to cha
t with an AI powered chatbot assistant is when the user is already searching for something. So this way, should our norm
al search not be able to deliver an instant search result, users can be “catched” and still have their problem resolved 
by the AI.

In terms of the UI, I decided to go with a slick right sidebar interface for the chatbot on the help center 
layout and a nicely integrated chat window within the search command bar of the documentation layout. Within the HelpKit
 embeddable widget as well as on mobile phones, HelpKit AI will show a full-screen chatbot interface to the user.

Overa
ll, the HelpKit public beta has been running for 2 weeks and users as well as customers are really satisfied with the gr
eat user experience. Which… also obviously makes me super happy ツ

&#x200B;

**Building on top of AI**

HelpKit AI is my
 first real touchpoint developing a product with Large Language Models (LLMs). After doing some simple warm-up Hello Wor
ld AI tests, everything seemed so simple.

Unfortunately I had to soon find out that I sincerely underestimated the comp
lexity involved in developing a conversational AI chatbot that closely mirrors human interaction.

Following a considera
ble period of experimentation with a plethora of existing tools, it's become apparent that the majority merely repurpose
 around 10 lines of Langchain code, presenting it as a fully-fledged product.The outcomes of these efforts are, at their
 best are 'meh'.

Some OK, but not great.I nearly fell into the same trap, having developed a feature that was 90% compl
ete before acknowledging the subpar and cluttered results, as well as my limited comprehension of this new technology.


Engaging with LLMs presents an entirely unique and novel paradigm.Consequently, I revisited the initial plans and invest
ed a lot of more time immersing myself in the intricacies of LLMs, AI User Experience, and a slew of way too complex res
earch papers, all in an effort to better understand how to construct tools around LLMs.

Interestingly, due to the novel
ty of this field, there's no definitive roadmap to a successful implementation. The process is characterized by a great 
deal of experimentation. You really need a flexible approach and swift adaptation to the frequent and rapid enhancements
 being made to these tools. As an engineer being used to having deterministic outcomes I just couldn’t believe the quirk
iness of testing out bunch of prompts to find out what works the best.

In the end everything finally clicked and I know
 exactly what I was doing and how I can make HelpKit AI as best as possible.

&#x200B;

**Wrapping up**

So that’s my li
ttle background story of building HelpKit AI and some of the struggles that I had. The biggest takeaway lesson from me h
ere was to realize that sometimes you need to stop being so harsh on yourself and accept that some things are more diffi
cult than others. You might need a little bit more time than you thought.

The beautiful thing for us Indiehackers is th
at we don’t have any pressuring project manager sitting behind our back pressuring us to release something despite the q
uality but somehow we still tend pressure ourselves even harder into it.

Take a step back, breath, learn more and then 
come back stronger.In case you are interested you can find the [HelpKit AI landing page here](https://www.helpkit.so/hel
pkit-ai/) and I also recorded a little [Youtube video demoing HelpKit AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhWrzh9pk-c) y
ou can check out.

&#x200B;

That's it!

&#x200B;

Hope this was useful to some of you reading this and also thinking ab
out embarking on the journey of building a big new feature for your product.

📢 Hello AI agent builders!

I'm thrilled to introduce you to **BondAI**, an AI Agent framework and CLI, with a lightweig
ht yet robust API making integration into your own applications straightforward and easy.

**Repository:** [**https://gi
thub.com/krohling/bondai**](https://github.com/krohling/bondai)

# ⚡️Examples

Here's an example of buying/selling Stock
s with [Alpaca Markets](https://alpaca.markets/). I strongly recommend using Paper Trading btw!

    from bondai import 
Agent
    from bondai.tools.alpaca_markets import CreateOrderTool, GetAccountTool, ListPositionsTool
    
    task = '''
I want you to sell off all of my existing positions.
    Then I want you to buy 10 shares of NVIDIA with a limit price o
f $456.'''
    
    Agent(tools=[
      CreateOrderTool(),
      GetAccountTool(),
      ListPositionsTool()
    ]).run(
task)

[**Here's an example**](https://github.com/krohling/bondai/tree/main/examples/online-research) of BondAI doing on
line research and [**here's a home automation example**](https://github.com/krohling/bondai/tree/main/examples/home-auto
mation).

# 🔍 What is BondAI?

**BondAI** is a framework crafted for the smooth integration and customization of Convers
ational AI Agents. Leveraging the power of OpenAI's [**function calling support**](https://openai.com/blog/function-call

Hello,

I'm making my way around the langchain circuit and practicing with langsmith. I am no stranger to accuracy tests
, I don't mind harmonic mean jokes because that's exactly what an f1 is.

Is there an analogous approach to similarity s
cores? For example, jaccard doesn't capture the magnitude or direction of the vectors, while cosine doesn't consider the
 order, frequency, or the context of the words.

Can i combine these scores into a hybrid accuracy score?

all -  [ The rollercoaster journey behind launch the HelpKit AI Notion Chatbot ](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/16ieqkw/the_rollercoaster_journey_behind_launch_the/) , 2023-09-15-0909
```
Hey folks!

Today I want to talk with you about the journey behind launching HelpKit AI. HelpKit is a solo founded and f
ully bootstrapped SaaS tool that turns your Notion docs into a professional help center and documentation site.

Since H
elpKit is already hosting hundreds of customers Notion knowledge bases it only made sense to supercharge them with a cus
tom AI trained chatbot. So far the results have been amazing.

And now, we just finally [launched today on Product Hunt]
(https://www.producthunt.com/posts/helpkit-ai) as well! The public beta is out since two weeks and we have onboarded mor
e than 15 customers on the add-on and the AI bot held 2000+ successful conversations.The launch was planned two months a
go but some things stopped me from releasing it.

If you are curious about the background feel free to read on.Now, let 
me explain why the journey to the launch was a bit rougher than expected. There were two big issues: The UX and building
 on top of AI.

**The UX Hurdle**

First and foremost, I was stuck with developing a great user experience. I have only 
come across a handful of products that were sort of implementing the same concept and I really did not like their UX imp
lementation. Everything felt clunky and just did not fit into the concept of an AI enabled knowledge base system.

You s
ee our AI chatbot needs to be integrated into HelpKit’s two layouts: Help Center and Documentation and also work well on
 the widget and mobile.Quite a tricky task to get right everywhere! I brainstormed for a few days, tried out some implem
entations but none of them felt natural for a user in my opinion.

I even spent a whole week building an interface only 
to then throw away the entire feature code branch and start from scratch.What I needed was a break. So I took a weekend 
break, spent some time at the beach and came back refreshed with some new ideas (that strangely all came to me during my
 Sunday evening shower).

I realised that the most intuitive way to present the option to chat with an AI powered chatbo
t assistant is when the user is already searching for something. So this way, should our normal search not be able to de
liver an instant search result, users can be “catched” and still have their problem resolved by the AI.

In terms of the
 UI, I decided to go with a slick right sidebar interface for the chatbot on the help center layout and a nicely integra
ted chat window within the search command bar of the documentation layout. Within the HelpKit embeddable widget as well 
as on mobile phones, HelpKit AI will show a full-screen chatbot interface to the user.

Overall, the HelpKit public beta
 has been running for 2 weeks and users as well as customers are really satisfied with the great user experience. Which…
 also obviously makes me super happy ツ

&#x200B;

**Building on top of AI**

HelpKit AI is my first real touchpoint deve
loping a product with Large Language Models (LLMs). After doing some simple warm-up Hello World AI tests, everything see
med so simple.

Unfortunately I had to soon find out that I sincerely underestimated the complexity involved in developi
ng a conversational AI chatbot that closely mirrors human interaction.

Following a considerable period of experimentati
on with a plethora of existing tools, it's become apparent that the majority merely repurpose around 10 lines of Langcha
in code, presenting it as a fully-fledged product.The outcomes of these efforts are, at their best are 'meh'.

Some OK, 
but not great.I nearly fell into the same trap, having developed a feature that was 90% complete before acknowledging th
e subpar and cluttered results, as well as my limited comprehension of this new technology.

Engaging with LLMs presents
 an entirely unique and novel paradigm.Consequently, I revisited the initial plans and invested a lot of more time immer
sing myself in the intricacies of LLMs, AI User Experience, and a slew of way too complex research papers, all in an eff
ort to better understand how to construct tools around LLMs.

Interestingly, due to the novelty of this field, there's n
o definitive roadmap to a successful implementation. The process is characterized by a great deal of experimentation. Yo
u really need a flexible approach and swift adaptation to the frequent and rapid enhancements being made to these tools.
 As an engineer being used to having deterministic outcomes I just couldn’t believe the quirkiness of testing out bunch 
of prompts to find out what works the best.

In the end everything finally clicked and I know exactly what I was doing a
nd how I can make HelpKit AI as best as possible.

&#x200B;

**Wrapping up**

So that’s my little background story of bu
ilding HelpKit AI and some of the struggles that I had. The biggest takeaway lesson from me here was to realize that som
etimes you need to stop being so harsh on yourself and accept that some things are more difficult than others. You might
 need a little bit more time than you thought.

The beautiful thing for us Indiehackers is that we don’t have any pressu
ring project manager sitting behind our back pressuring us to release something despite the quality but somehow we still
 tend pressure ourselves even harder into it.

Take a step back, breath, learn more and then come back stronger.In case 
you are interested you can find the [HelpKit AI landing page here](https://www.helpkit.so/helpkit-ai/) and I also record
ed a little [Youtube video demoing HelpKit AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhWrzh9pk-c) you can check out.That's it!


Hope this was useful to some of you reading this and also thinking about embarking on the journey of building a big ne
w feature for your product.

Hi there,

Recently started building LLM applications, While talking to developers in the field, I got overwhelmed by al

* Indexing
* Retrieval

(I w
ill not even start with 10s of different vector DB providers)

I'd love to collect **best practices for common pain poin

&#x200B;

1. **What is your tool stack for LLM applicatio

2. **What problems did you experience?**
3. **How did you solve it? (if it's solved, otherwise 'looking for a solu

I've been working on a project where I utilise langchain to retrieve information about safety tech companies from variou

I'm able to get some results but it feels k
inda tame and limited, I'm trying to figure out ways to:

&#x200B;

1. **Web Retrieval Scope**: expand my search to cove
r more parts of the internet for a broader and more comprehensive dataset.
2. **Result Export**: After the retrieval and
 processing, I want to be able to sort and export the results to an Excel sheet. Each row representing a company, with t
he columns containing specific information such as the company's name, CEO, description, and so on  
.

If anyone has ex
perience with this kinda thing or similar tools and can provide insights or suggestions, I'd greatly appreciate it. I'm 
keen on getting better at this and using it more frequently .

```
What has the biggest leverage to improve the performance of RAG when operating at scale?

When I was working for a Legal
Tech startup and we had to ingest millions of litigation documents into a single vector database collection, we figured 
out that you can increase the retrieval results significantly by using an open source embedding model (sentence-transfor
mers/sentence-t5-xxl) instead of OpenAI ADA.

What other techniques do you see besides swapping the model?

We are build
ing VectorFlow an open-source vector embedding pipeline and want to know what other features we should build next after 
adding open-source Sentence Transformer embedding models. Check out our Github repo: [https://github.com/dgarnitz/vector

```
Hello, I've been working my way around the gpt tools world, and have built 5 or 6 personal projects using different aspe
cts of tools (personal custom python script, embedding, langchain agents and tools, autogpt - have not fine tuned yet as
 I have not been able to justify the use case). I run them all through streamlit. But now I am building a production ver
sion and I am still in the weeds.

&#x200B;

TLDR: What tools should I be using? What data structures for agents and dat
a should I be using? How do i store data to make it available to the LLM? I'm sorry this turned into a novel, but maybe 
it will be edifying for others.

&#x200B;

Details:

I like my pure python / bard hacky python, for what it does. I'm tr
ying to recreate it using langchain. Here's how my script works:

\- Takes business name input from user (streamlit)

\-
 reads all initial\_prompt\_x.txt - handles formatting, questions, etc. for each review subsection

\- replace placehold
er strings with inputs

\- get results from bard

\- read filter\_prompt.txt - handles fact-checking (bard is live-data,
 which is why i did all this)

\- print final result

&#x200B;

This outputs a structured review based on different cate
gories/features that is pretty good, but it's total BS. But it is kind of langchain framework already. It has some funda
mental flaws, the core problem being, even though the data ARE live, we can't expect an LLM to know which products are c
urrently available.

&#x200B;

\*\*Goal\*\*: break down my tasks using lanchain agents and tools. Not sure if I should b
e embedding or not. Here is my pseudocode:

\- Take input (as before)

\- Use templates instead of manually constructing
 prompts with python. Use micro-prompts for ea

\- Initialize agent, llm, tools (internet browse, youtubesearch, date / 
site parser). \*\*question \*\* Should I be using use other tools? like SERP?

\- Look up website, parse to obtain produ
ct availability

\- Result storage, \*\*question\*\*. How do i store this this data? A hacky version is to store it loca
lly, and then run a prompt / template to perform tasks based on those objects. That is a bad answer. Should I be embeddi
ng all these sets? It's basically a few thousand PDFs.

\- perform data-augmented task on availability

\- assemble resu
lts into final product

&#x200B;

Does this all sound right? I could add more steps, like specifically getting reviews f
rom yelp / google / foursquare, and embedding those as well, rather than just relying on internet search?

all -  [ Help needed for langchain create_pandas_dataframe_agent with Open AI function ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/16hlioz/help_needed_for_langchain_create_pandas_dataframe/) , 2023-09-15-0909
```
I’m using **create_pandas_dataframe_agent** (using OpenAI Function as agent type) with a df .

But I’m not able to make 
the memory work that resides in my agent. Ultimate goal is to built a chatbot which can query database and have a memory
 of previous conversations.

For example, Issue is agent forget the context although memory is there in 'history' parame
ter of the memory. I'm using ConversationSummaryBufferMemory which keeps conversation in summary form.

> Human: What is
 the ESG score of Mastercard?

> AI: The ESG score of Mastercard is 83.

> Human: What is the L1 score of this company?


> AI: Can you specify which company you are referring? 

Please note that, previous conversations are saved in 'history
' but agent is not able to relate while asking questions. What should be my prompt? Sharing my sample code:

**Defined L
LM for Agent and for Memory**

llm_code = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo-16k')

llm_context = ChatO
penAI(temperature=0.5, model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo-16k')

**Defined Memory**

memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm
=llm_context, max_token_limit=10)

**Defined Agent**

openai__agent = 
        
create_pandas_dataframe_agent(
        

        llm_code,
        
        df1,
        
        prefix=prefix.format(chat_history=memory.load_memory_variables(
{})['history']),
        
        verbose=True,
        
        handle_parsing_errors=True,
        
        agent_exec
utor_kwargs={'memory': memory,
                       'handle_parsing_errors' : True},
        
        agent_type=Agent
Type.OPENAI_FUNCTIONS
)
Here is my Prompt and Prefix that is fed into the Agent with memory

prompt = ''' You are a help
ful assistant that can answer questions based on the given data(table, chat_history) and rules.You are working with a pa
ndas dataframe in Python. The name of the dataframe is df. You should use the tools below to answer the question posed o
f you:

    Rules:
    A)Only use the factual information from the available data to answer the question.
    B)If you d
on't have enough information to answer the question, say 'I don't know'.
    C)Provide answers without mentioning the sp
ecific source of the information.


   < Last few messages between you and user > :

    {chat_history}
    '''
prefix =
 PromptTemplate( input_variables=['chat_history'], template=prompt )

P.S - I want to use 'create_pandas_dataframe_agent
' with [AgentType as OpenAI.Functions.] and not as Zero Shot, since Open AI agent type is faster and better in reasoning

Olá Devs,

Eu tenho feito uma série de posts em relação ao fluxo de AI para trabalhar como *software developer* ([part 2
](https://www.reddit.com/r/devpt/comments/13oi66l/o_fluxo_de_trabalho_como_fullstack_focado_%C3%A1_volta/)). Nestes últi
mos meses tem havido imensas mudanças no que apareceu no mercado e queria dar um update:

# Motivation:

**Automation do
esn't work -** Eu estava a tentar automatizar, mas não resulta. É demasiado (e.g langchain flow).

**Models and limitati
ons -** Os modelos dentro do IDE são limitados.

**Github Copilot:**

https://preview.redd.it/ktru973cd0ob1.png?width=17
40&format=png&auto=webp&s=41a695544881f93e5c8a0a1066c2000ffe9f57dc

Isto é o primeiro modelo do github copilot. Funciona
 bem para completar funções.

**Github Chat:**

https://preview.redd.it/hyl1qinmd0ob1.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=web
p&s=8efbeca469e139fd56f5ce9b9037816fe0cf9b9d

Funciona bem para coisas mais abrangentes mas fechadas. Não consegue ver a
 'big picture'. É um bocado '**meh**'

**GPT-4 superior reasoning skills:**

A principal razão para ter feito este novo 
fluxo é porque via me constantemente a entrar dentro do ChatGPT e resolver o problema que o copilot Chat não conseguia.


# New approach:

O que mudou isto foi mesmo a feature '**Advance Data Analysis/code interpreter**'. Essencialmente por 
trás tem um ecosistema de python para analysis, o que é optimo porque consegue concentrar muito mais contexto do que o m
odelo é suposto conseguir. Resolve também o problema de estar preso em **setembro de 2021**.

erfe42e0ob1.png?width=2536&format=png&auto=webp&s=82dfcb5a94c187bf5167bb441a686b282afc7de2

1- **Setting the environment
.**

* Advance Data Analysis/code interpreter
* [Professor synapse](https://github.com/ProfSynapse/Synapse_CoR) \- Simul
a 'auto-gpt tasks'. Util para guiar o que fazer.

2- **Load Codebase and possible documentation.**

* Basta dar zip ao c
ódigo todo, que ele consegue extrair.
* Ir ao Github e ir buscar documentação se necessário (e.g nextjs, prisma)

3- **L
oad the task. Generate the code**

4- **Go back to IDE and refactor what is needed**. Em termos de testes continua igual
.

It seems to have Llama2 model support but I haven't been able to find much in the way of guides/tutorials on how 
to set up such a system. I come from a design background and have used a bit of ComfyUI for SD and use node based workfl

Does anyone have an expertise with this workflow, any suggestions before I get stuck in? T

Hi,
I'm using langchain, embeddings and the openai API to 'talk to my pdf documents'. When I want to verify the response
 I must open the pdf manually and use the search function. How can I generate source attributions like. Document 'xy.pdf

```
I was planning on using LangChain in a recent project. Basically, I have hundreds of documents worth of text from a text
book, and I wanted to create a 'chatbot' which could return information to questions which could be found in the textboo
k. However, I realized that OpenAI doesn't offer free credits for the API anymore, so I was wondering: how many tokens w
ill it take to do all of this? Will all of the pages of the textbook count as tokens in the prompt, or will only the que
stion I ask count? I don't want to run it once and accidentally waste like 50 dollars worth of tokens.

```
Hey all, we just released our new project/paper and we thought you all might find it useful!

Our project (Kani) is a su
per lightweight and hackable alternative to frameworks like LangChain or simpleAIchat meant to help developers hook in c
allable functions or tools to chat models easily. With Kani, devs can write functions in pure python and just add one li
ne (the `@ai_function()` decorator) to turn any function into an AI-callable function!

Kani works with any model and ha
s built-in tools for OpenAI, HuggingFace, LLaMAv2, Vicuna, and GGML with more to come. Kani also never does any prompt e
ngineering under the hood and doesn't require learning complex library tools---all defaults are minimal and highly custo
mizable.

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Data Extraction using fine-tuned LLM? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/16fenlb/d_data_extraction_using_finetuned_llm/) , 2023-09-15-0909
```
Hey Reddit,

I'm working on a tool to pull data from highly irregular Excel files. I've gotten reasonable results which 
is extremely fast with standard Python coding, but it's far from perfect due to the lack of standardized templates. 

In
terestingly, when I tested ChatGPT-4 on a sample table, it did a decent job at data extraction. However, relying solely 
on GPT-4 has its downsides like token limits and slow processing speed (and data privacy issues). Plus, splitting the Ex
cel sheet to fit within these limits results in loss of context and data.

I'm considering fine-tuning a language model 
to post-process data that was in a Pandas DataFrame (perhaps converted to JSON). Has anyone had success with this approa
ch or have alternative recommendations? I've tried Langchain, but it wasn't helpful.

I have figured out to extract the 
relevant columns, but the post-processing part is where I am considering using an LLM which understands the domain and w
hat needs to be extracted based on the examples I feed it.

Looking forward to your thoughts! And would be happy to answ
er any additional questions.

MachineLearning -  [ [D] Chains and Agents ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/16d7ee6/d_chains_and_agents/) , 2023-09-15-0909
```
I think there's a lot of confusion around AI agents today and it's mainly because of lack of definition and using the wr
ong terminology.

We've been talking to many companies who are claiming they're working on agents but when you look unde
r the hood, they are really just chains.

I just listened to the Latent Space pod with Harrison Chase (Founder of Langch
ain) and I really liked how he thinks about chains vs agents.

Chains: sequence of tasks in a more rigid order, where yo
u have more control, more predictability.  
Agents: handling the edge-cases, the long-tail of things that can happen.

A
nd the most important thing is that it's not an OR question but an AND one: you can use them in the same application by 
starting with chains -> figuring our the edge-cases -> using agents to deal with them.

wing for easy switching between them, and makes  some work for specific use cases easier. If I wanted to write an app or
  script to interact with LLMs and do other tasks, how would LangChain be  better than just making API call(s) to an LLM
, getting back the result  as a string, and doing whatever with it?

I’m looking for recommendations, suggestions, and/or good documentation that outlines which data pipeline would be best 
to ingest my private data (which will then be split into chunks/nodes for vector embeddings and so forth). Thank you in 
advance!

MachineLearning -  [ [P] LLM Apps Are Mostly Data Pipelines ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15z0muk/p_llm_apps_are_mostly_data_pipelines/) , 2023-09-15-0909

My colleague just wrote up an article on [LLM-based apps and how to use data engineering tools to help build them faster
](https://meltano.com/blog/llm-apps-are-mostly-data-pipelines/) that I found really insightful.

It contains a complete 
implementation

* with scraping context data from a docs website
* chunking it, getting embeddings via the openAI API
* 
loading it into pinecone
* and finally a simple Q&A interface with streamlit on top of it

**Here's a quick summary:**


* LangChain and LlamaIndex are great tools for quick exploration
* But aren't perfect for production-grade use
* I think
 we all know the 'LangChain is pointless' debate, but there's a lot of real meat to it, and Pat describes a few of them 
(a lot of LangChains extractors are super basic, 2-3 liners without retries etc.)
* LLM applications are all about movin
g data, extracting and enriching data (creating embeddings!) are the most expensive ones of those steps
* A bunch of dat
a engineering tools are out there that make these two steps much easier, versionable, robust, and reproducible.
* Meltan
o is one such tool and Pat implemented the above described pipeline with it

**FWIW**: The GitHub project that comes wit
h the post is super easy to run and super modular. I just tested it and was able to modify everything for my own applica
tion within 30 mins.

MachineLearning -  [ [P] pgml-chat: A command-line tool for deploying low-latency knowledge-based chatbots ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15t5nzl/p_pgmlchat_a_commandline_tool_for_deploying/) , 2023-09-15-0909
```
We've created an open source chat bot builder, on top of PostgresML. This tool makes it easy to ingest documents and set
 a system prompt for a chatbot with knowledge of your content. The innovation is in the simplicity and efficiency, rathe
r than the functionality.

PostgresML runs open source embedding models alongside pgvector in Postgres to implement chat
 bot prompt creation without any network calls, which makes it \~4x faster than competing architectures. It can also do 
text generation with that prompt (and no additional network hops) using any open source model from HuggingFace, but it a
lso integrates with the GPT-4 API if you'd like to use that instead. 

The full writeup including some benchmarks for co
mpeting architectures is here:  [https://postgresml.org/blog/pgml-chat-a-command-line-tool-for-deploying-low-latency-kno
wledge-based-chatbots-part-I](https://postgresml.org/blog/pgml-chat-a-command-line-tool-for-deploying-low-latency-knowle
dge-based-chatbots-part-I)

\[our Discord\]([https://discord.com/channels/1013868243036930099/1013868243536072868](https://discord.com/channels/1013

* The source code for 
the bot builder and server is only a few hundred lines of Python [https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/tree/master/p
gml-apps/pgml-chat#readme](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/tree/master/pgml-apps/pgml-chat#readme)
* The chat a
pp is so small, because it's delegates all the vector db and embedding generation options to our Python client SDK, whic
h is available for anyone to build other apps with: [https://pypi.org/project/pgml/](https://pypi.org/project/pgml/)
* T
he Python client SDK is so small, because it's just a wrapper around the Rust client SDK: [https://github.com/postgresml
/postgresml/tree/master/pgml-sdks/rust/pgml](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml/tree/master/pgml-sdks/rust/pgml). 
Currently we also support JS/Typescript SDKs as well, all generated from the same safe and efficient underlying Rust imp
lementation, using some fancy Rust macros.
* The Rust client SDK is also pretty simple though, because it just delegates
 everything to the Postgres database extension, which is where everything is computed in a single GPU accelerated proces
s, without having to load any ML models, data, or dependencies on client apps, effectively eliminating all the typical M
L data<->model network hops. Which makes it faster, simpler and safer.

This lays out what we think a is a better approa
ch to AI application architecture compared to libraries like LangChain or LlamaIndex, that focus on glueing together dis
parate data stores, algorithms, models over the network.

A lot of you might be giving me a mouthful just by reading the title of this blog. But to each their own, and probably y
ou might be just riding the hype train. Initially, I was quite fascinated by the work being done on LangChain and using 
it. And so I thought I would give it a try, but when I was installing it, I saw it downloading loads and loads of other 
libraries and most of which were not useful for what I was trying to build.

```
Hey folks,

I've been digging everywhere, including here, for LLMs and custom applications. So, I read many things, lear
ned from ppl here. Its time to try something. I will try implement Llama v2 - Langchain - Chroma combination. But also I
 want to upload a dataset so that I can try my model on that. 

I find some datasets big enough (for now, 2-5 gb is ok) 
however they are table-style. I want something more texty, I mean I could use 'American Stories' or 'Arxiv' however I be
lieve that they are already used by Llama to train. 

&#x200B;

Is there any suggestions or sources that you can provide
 ? Thanks!
