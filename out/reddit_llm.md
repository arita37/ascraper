```
Gemini for Gmail is great but it's expensive. So I decided to build one for myself this weekend - A smart gmail assistan
t that runs locally and completely free, powered by llama-3.2-3b-instruct.

Stack:
- local LLM server running llama-3.2-
3b-instruct from LM studio with Apple MLX
- Gmail plugin built by Claude

Took less than 30min to get here. Plan to add 
a local RAG over all my emails and some custom features.

hey everybody,

  
i just published the first of a long planned series of blog posts detailing things that I learn while
 building w/ LangGraph at relative length. this is my first time ever attempting to do a technical blog, so i'd welcome 
any and all tips on how to do these in a way that's at least potentially helpful to someone reading. thanks in advance i
f you've got feedback!

```
Hi, I've been working as an analyst for a retail company for a few years, but it's pretty basic and mostly focused on re
porting, dashboards, etc, so I'm looking for more roles with a heavier data science and computation focus. But I'm getti
ng overwhelmed and confused about what sorts of roles to look for.

A quick google search for 'types of roles in data sc
ience' and you'll find dozens of pages filled with SEO-driven buzzwords (possibly AI-generated), but these only give the
 most surface-level and generic descriptions of common titles like data analyst, data scientist, data engineer, etc. Thi
s isn't really what I'm looking for though lol. I know what these are. Also, so many roles today seem to just be focused
 on shoving the latest LLM stack (RAG, langchain, etc) into the problem even if the use case for the company is slim or 
marginal at best. This isn't really what I'm interested in cause I like operations data science more.

What I'm looking 
for is a more specific, tailored advice relevant to specific types of industries/specializations. For example

* I reall
y like building models that heavily rely on functional programming, and may make use of very niche or specific libraries
 depending on the use case. I enjoy Project Euler type problems for example
* I understand ML is a core part of data sci
ence, but I enjoy projects where ML isn't exclusive to the problem. A lot of other models can be solved by more function
al programming and tailored computational science type work
* I guess my background right now is mostly focused on busin
ess/operations/economics, so I don't have a specific engineering or hard science background, but I'm open to any area th
at invovles applied mathematics.

I would appreciate any and all advice. As specific or general as possible. But prefera
bly something specific.

I figured it might be useful to build graphs using declarative syntax instead of imperative one for a couple of usecases
:

* Tools trying to build low-code builders/managers for LangGraph.
* Tools trying to build graphs dynamically based on
 a usecase

and more...

I went through the documentation and landed [here](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/api_refere
nce/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.graph.Graph.html#langchain_core.runnables.graph.Graph.to_json).

and noticed
 that there is a \`to\_json()\` feature. It only seems fitting that there be an inverse.

So I attempted to make a build
er for the same that consumes JSON/YAML files and creates a compiled graph.

[https://github.com/esxr/declarative-builde
r-for-langgraph](https://github.com/esxr/declarative-builder-for-langgraph)

Is this a good approach? Are there existing
 libraries to do the same? (I know that there might be an asymmetry that might require explicit instructions to make it 
invertible but I'm working on the edge cases)

Hey guys, I created a framework to build [agentic systems called GenSphere](https://github.com/octopus2023-inc/gensphere
) which allows you to create agentic systems from YAML configuration files. Now, I'm experimenting generating these YAML
 files with LLMs so I don't even have to code in my own framework anymore. The results look quite interesting, its not f
ully complete yet, but promising.

For instance, I asked to create an agentic workflow for the following prompt:

    Yo
ur task is to generate script for 10 YouTube videos, about 5 minutes long each.
    Our aim is to generate content for Y
ouTube in an ethical way, while also ensuring we will go viral.
    You should discover which are the topics with the hi
ghest chance of going viral today by searching the web.
    Divide this search into multiple granular steps to get the b
est out of it. You can use Tavily and Firecrawl_scrape
    to search the web and scrape URL contents, respectively. Then
 you should think about how to present these topics in order to make the video go viral.
    Your script should contain 
detailed text (which will be passed to a text-to-speech model for voiceover),
    as well as visual elements which will 
be passed to as prompts to image AI models like MidJourney.
    You have full autonomy to create highly viral videos fol
lowing the guidelines above. 
    Be creative and make sure you have a winning strategy.

I got back a full workflow wit
h 12 nodes, multiple rounds of searching and scraping the web, LLM API calls, (attaching tools and using structured outp
uts autonomously in some of the nodes) and function calls.

I then just runned and got back a pretty decent result, witho
ut any bugs:

and so on (the actual output is pretty big, and would generate around \~50min of content indeed).


So, we basically went from prompt to agent in just a few minutes, not even having to code anything. For some examples I 
tried, the agent makes some mistake and the code doesn't run, but then its super easy to debug because all nodes are eit
her LLM API calls or function calls. At the very least you can iterate a lot faster, and avoid having to code on cumbers

Hi there. 

As title implies, I'm trying to use a ConversationChain to implement Chain-of-thought reasoning on an LLM ag
ent in a game-like setting. 

  
Unfortunately, I am running into the persistent issue where, at the end of each Chain-o
f-thought dialogue, I ask the agent which action it wants to take, and it sys something along the lines of 

  
'As an A
I agent in this multi-agent game, I am not able to make purchases. My role is to provide information and analyze potenti
al strategies. Therefore, I cannot respond to this prompt.'

  
Any suggestions for how to get around this? I'm running 
into a wall using different prompts. I explicitly tell the agent '

    YOU ARE an agent in this multi-agent game.
    


And it is still giving me the same non-committal answer. 

Thanks!

So i'm planning to build an LLM application which reads a user conversation (based on a message list) and replies t

The reason i ask is that the GPT needs context, but sending it large messages list also ea

```
In the company I work for we are developing a chatbot using the OpenAI, the idea is that the chatbot follows the RAG app
roach, we generated a vector database with all the relevant documents, then we created an API that is consumed from a we
b app (That at the same time it will be consumed from several kiosk around the installations). 

I have a very basic app
roach, I'm using chroma, langchain and FastAPI. Everything seems to work relatively 'fine' but after our initial test we
 have found that we reach the TPM (Tokens Per Minute) rate really fast, so doing some debugging and manual testing I hav
e found that the  history is growing really fast, because after some questions/interaction with the chat, the json that 
is send .  
  
 The json I'm using to manage the question and the history is like this:

{'questions': 'What are the man
uals used for the packing area?', 'history':\['Other previous question', 'other answer'\]}

Is there any example o docum
entation about good practices dealing with the history or how to save tokens while using it?

Sorry for my bad English, 
it is not my first language.

```
Hi Everyone,

I've been working on a project called otto-m8 (automate) that lets users spin up a wide range of AI models
, starting from Traditional deep learning models to large language models, all through a flowchart like user interface. 
At its core, otto-m8 will deploy a Docker container of your workflow that you can use as an API to integrate with your e
xisting workflows, build a AI assistant chatbot or use it as a standalone API/application.

The idea is simple-provide a
 easy-to-use user interface to spin up AI models. A lot of code needed to run AI models(both LLMs and traditional deep l
earning models) are boilerplate code blocks, including the deployments which is more often than not a REST API serving t
he model. The goal of otto-m8 is not only to abstract that through code but to abstract the entire process into a UI. Th
e project aims to allow both technical and non technical folks get started with running workflows that leverage all the 
latest advances of AI. We're potentially talking about building AI Agents that integrate with your gmail, slack or other
 external API's, or even integrating traditional computer vision models(YOLO) with both LLM's and huggingface ecosystem.
 And since you're launching an API via a Docker container, you can deploy your workflows in the cloud or self host it. I
'm aware I have a lot of competitors doing similar things but more than just a product, I envision this platform to be a
 tool similar to LlamaIndex, Langchain, Huggingface, Ollama, etc that streamlines spinning up AI ML applications. Here's
 an example of what I'm aiming for: [https://www.databricks.com/glossary/compound-ai-systems](https://www.databricks.com
/glossary/compound-ai-systems)

This is pretty much in an MVP stage, and before I get deeper into this, I'm trying to ga
uge whether the community will find some platform like this useful, so give it a shot. If you like the idea, drop a star
 so you can stay updated with the latest changes.

PS: Sorry about the fact that there
's very little documentation. As an MVP, I want to see whether using the platform is intuitive from the get go. I would 
really appreciate your feedback

```
I am working with PDF rental contracts which can vary in size (up to 40 pages or so). I have a structured output which I
 want to pull out of each contract (eg. Name of the renter, address, price, apartment size, etc). The data within the co
ntract will be scattered around within the various paragraphs (no structured format within the PDF content). If the PDFs
 were all small I could just convert to text, throw it into the prompt and ask the model to extract my fields in json ou
tput. However the size will not always fit the context window of the agent. My initial idea is to chunk the text, and se
nd each to an agent async, each time asking the agent to try to find any data from my target fields (if the chunk doesn'
t match any fields then the agent should give an empty json object). After all chunks have been individually checked, ga
ther the results and create one final json. 


Does this seem like a plausible strategy/approach?

```
Hi everyone,

I'm working on a project where we're ingesting and indexing data from various external tools using [Micros
oft GraphRAG](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag). This helps us generate knowledge graphs, summaries, and identify c
ommunities within the data.

Our challenge is implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for this data. We need to en
sure that users can only access information appropriate for their level within a hierarchy. However, the hierarchy is hi
ghly fluid and dynamic—it can change at any time with new people, roles, and organisational structures emerging across d
ifferent industries.

Traditional rule-based RBAC systems aren't sufficient here because they can't adapt quickly enough
 to these changes. Since we're dealing with text-based data and complex relationships, we're exploring the use of AI age
nts or autonomous intelligence to determine access permissions.

Our idea is to have an AI agent that can semantically u
nderstand the knowledge graph created by GraphRAG. By leveraging all the information about the person requesting the dat
a (which is included in the graph) along with other relevant data points, the agent would determine whether the person s
hould have access to the requested information.

I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on:

* **Implementing Dynamic R
BAC with AI**: Has anyone tackled similar challenges using AI or LLMs for access control in fluid hierarchies?
* **Seman
tic Understanding for Access Control**: What approaches are effective for enabling AI agents to semantically understand 
and reason over knowledge graphs for this purpose?
* **Potential Pitfalls**: What are the risks or limitations of relyin
g on AI for access control decisions, especially in terms of security and compliance?
* **Existing Models or Frameworks*
*: Are there any models, frameworks, or tools you'd recommend that could assist in building this AI-driven RBAC system?


Any insights, experiences, or resources would be greatly appreciated!

*Edit: For those unfamiliar,* [*Microsoft GraphR
AG*](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag) *is a tool that helps in creating knowledge graphs by integrating data from 
various sources, which can then be used for generating summaries and identifying relationships within the data.*

# ## Advice

Hello Community, I am looking to build out micro-saas out of RAG by combining both Software Engineering and
 AI principles. I have actually build out the version 1 of backend, with following features.

Features:

* SSO login
* P
ermission based access control on data and quering
* Support for multiple data connectors like drive, dropbox, confluenc
e, s3, gcp, etc
* Incremental indexing
* Plug and play components for different parsers, dataloaders, retrievers, query 
mechanisms, etc
* Single Gateway for your open and closed source models, embeddings, rerankers with rate limiting and to
ken limiting.
* Audit Trails
* Open Telemetry for prompt logging, llm cost, vector db performance and gpu metrics

More 
features coming soon…

Most importantly everything is built asynchronous, without heavy libraries like langchain or llam
aindex. I am looking for community feedback to understand will these features be good for any business? If at all, is an
yone interested to collaborate either in help secure funding, frontend work, help me get connected with other folks, etc
? Thank you

```
📚 Semantic chunking is an advanced method for dividing text in RAG. Instead of using arbitrary word/token/character coun
ts, it breaks content into meaningful segments based on context.
Here's how it works:

* Content Analysis
* Intelligent 
Segmentation
* Contextual Embedding

✨ Benefits over traditional chunking:

* Preserves complete ideas & concepts
* Main
tains context across divisions
* Improves retrieval accuracy
* Enables better handling of complex information

This appr
oach leads to more accurate and comprehensive AI responses, especially for complex queries.

Hello everyone,

I've been working with AWS Bedrock's guardrails system for LLMs in production, and I thought I'd share 
my findings about implementing proper safety controls for AI systems.

If you're deploying LLMs in production, you proba
bly know the anxiety of wondering 'what if my model says something it shouldn't?' Well, AWS Bedrock has some interesting
 built-in guardrails features that I've tested extensively. I wrote a detailed guide covering:

* How guardrails actuall
y work in AWS Bedrock
* A complete implementation guide with LangChain
* Real cost analysis (spoiler: it can be from fre
e to $1.00 per 1000 text units depending on the features)
* Step-by-step console setup with practical examples

The inte
resting part is that while everyone talks about prompt engineering for safety, systematic guardrails are actually crucia
l for production systems - and they're surprisingly easy to implement with Bedrock.

If you're interested, check out my 
post [here](https://www.metadocs.co/2024/11/08/make-your-chat-and-rag-application-safe-with-aws-bedrock-guardrails/).

L
et me know if you have any questions! I'm particularly curious to hear if anyone else has experience with other guardrai
l systems and how they compare to Bedrock's implementation.

Have a nice read! :D

# Inconsistent Document Retrieval Results with Azure AI Search Retriever: Need Help

# Problem Description

I'm experien
cing inconsistent document retrieval results when using `AzureAISearchRetriever`. When querying about policies, sometime
s I get the correct policy-related documents, but other times I get completely unrelated documents, even with the same e
xact query.

# Current Implementation

Here's my current code:

retriever = AzureAISearchRetriever(  
content\_key='cont
ent',  
top\_k=5,  
index\_name='my\_index\_name'  
)

# Example Scenario

* **Question**: 'What is the company policy f
or X?'
* **Expected**: Should consistently return documents related to the specific policy I'm asking about
* **Actual R
esult**:
   * First try: Gets relevant policy documents
   * Second try (same query): Gets random documents about differ
ent topics
   * Third try: Sometimes gets partially relevant documents

# Questions

1. Why am I getting inconsistent re
sults for the same query?
2. How can I ensure the retriever consistently returns relevant documents?
3. Are there specif
ic configurations or parameters I should add to improve accuracy?
4. What's the best practice for setting up AzureAISear
chRetriever for consistent results?

# Technical Details

* Using Azure AI Search with Python
* Retrieving top 5 documen
ts
* Basic implementation without any special configurations
* Using the latest version of the Azure AI Search SDK

Any

ery], <MilvusException: (code=65535, message=invalid max query result window, (offset+limit) should be in range [1, 1638
4], but got 30000)>
 Error retrieving data from Milvus: <MilvusException: (code=65535, message=invalid max query result 
window, (offset+limit) should be in range [1, 16384], but got 30000)>
It seems the offset + limit constraint in Milvus l
imits queries to a maximum of 16,384 results, which is far below the 30K+ results I need to retrieve for my use case.

Q
uestions:
 Is there a recommended way to retrieve a large volume of data (e.g., 30K+ records) from a Milvus collection?

 Can I perform this retrieval in batches, or is there another efficient workaround?
 Are there any best practices for ha
ndling large query results in Milvus to avoid this kind of limitation?
Any guidance or suggestions for retrieving large 
datasets in Milvus would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

all -  [ How to Ensure Highly Relevant Search Results in Qdrant VectorStore with Metadata and Similarity Filt ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1gm4ebl/how_to_ensure_highly_relevant_search_results_in/) , 2024-11-11-0913
```
I'm working with Qdrant to build a search system for a diverse set of documents. My goal is to retrieve only the most re
levant results for a given query, avoiding unrelated documents even if they share similar keywords. For example, I have 
documents on legal cases and documents explaining construction processes, and I want to ensure that a query about a 'cli
ent process' in the context of a legal case doesn’t bring up results related to construction. I'm also usign langchain t
o get this results 

I’ve come across the `VectorStoreRetriever` options in Qdrant, which allow configuring search types
 like `'similarity'`, `'mmr'`, and `'similarity_score_threshold'`. I also see options for `score_threshold`, `k`, and `f
ilter` that can help refine results.

Here's how I’m currently thinking of setting it up:

* **Set** `search_type` **to*
* `'similarity_score_threshold'` to ensure only documents with a high relevance score are returned.
* **Use a** `score_t
hreshold` to filter out lower-relevance results.
* `vectorstore.as_retriever( search_type='mmr', search_kwargs={'k': 1, 
'lambda_mult': 0.25} )`

**My questions:**

1. Is this the best approach for narrowing down search results in Qdrant to 
ensure relevance and avoid unrelated content?
2. Any additional tips for optimizing Qdrant’s `VectorStoreRetriever` to h
andle large, diverse datasets?
3. Is this actually possible? I understand that my answer remains unchanged and coherent,
 but the incorrect metadata still appears. If I need to use this metadata as a reference, it could cause confusion.

Tha
nks in advance for any guidance or recommendations!

all -  [ Tutorial on building agent with memory using Letta  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1glzob6/tutorial_on_building_agent_with_memory_using_letta/) , 2024-11-11-0913
```
Hi all - I'm one of the creators of [Letta](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta), an agents framework focused on memory, a
nd we just released a free short [course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/llms-as-operating-systems-agent-memo
ry/) with Andrew Ng. The course covers both the memory management research (e.g. MemGPT) behind Letta, as well as an int
roduction to using the OSS agents framework. 

  
Unlike other frameworks, Letta is very focused on persistence and havi
ng 'agents-as-a-service'. This means that all state (including messages, tools, memory, etc.) is all persisted in a DB. 
So all agent state is essentially automatically save across sessions (and even if you re-start the server). We also have
 an ADE (Agent Development Environment) to easily view and iterate on your agent design. 

  
I've seen a lot of people 
posting here about using agent framework like Langchain, CrewAI, etc. -- we haven't marketed that much in general but th
ought the course might be interesting to people here!

all -  [ Space vs NewLine issues in pdf extractor. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1glza5b/space_vs_newline_issues_in_pdf_extractor/) , 2024-11-11-0913
```
Hi Folks,   
I have a bunch of pdfs that I need to process and build a RAG application (hopefully!). 

I tried several p
df processors - pdfplumber, pypdf, pymupdf4llm, etc. But noticing a very weird behavior. Somehow, a bullet point with a 
few spaces is getting converted to a new line.

for e.g - 

'2.     abc',  

in the pdf will get converted to -

'2.

ab
c' after processing.    
What am I missing? 

    class PDFProcessor:
        def __init__(self, pdf_path):
            
self.pdf_path = pdf_path
    
        def get_text(self):
            loader = PyMuPDFLoader(self.pdf_path)
            
self.data = loader.load()
            all_page_data = ''
            for page in self.data:
                all_page_dat
a += page.page_content
    
    
            # self.data = pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(self.pdf_path)
            self.all_p
age_data = all_page_data
            return self.data

I am working on a RAG based application . I wanted to add translation feature in my chatbot that translates the response
 given by the LLM. I have tried Argotranslate and MarianMT libraries earlier but they were not performing upto the mark.

Hey,  
I am experincing non-determinism while working with gpt-4o through langchain - everything is constant as far as i
 can tell (seed, temprature, prompt, tool results)   
  
I found this [article](https://community.openai.com/t/seed-para
m-and-reproducible-output-do-not-work/487245) Is it true that you cannot achieve determinism in openai?

Hi everyone, I have been developing an Customer Chatbot on Langraph. With this chatbot customers can be able to ask ques
tions about products we sell. And I wonder how can I show an image as output in the chatbot. For example when a customer
 wants to buy a product using chatbot, before the selling I wanna show the picture of the product to the customer in the
 chatbot. How can I do that? Any post or documents would be great.

all -  [ Issues with Chain Customization | LangChain Natural language to SQL Query ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1gls1kt/issues_with_chain_customization_langchain_natural/) , 2024-11-11-0913
```
I’ve been working on building a LangChain setup that performs a full SQL query process in multiple steps:

1. **Generate
 SQL Query** \- Create an SQL query based on the user’s input.
2. **Validate the Query** \- Prompt the LLM with the orig
inal user question and database context, and validate the generated query.
3. **Execute the Query** \- Run the validated
 query and store the results.
4. **Convert to Natural Language** \- Take the SQL result and reformat it for a human-read
able response.

However, I’m running into issues with LangChain’s intermediate steps. Specifically: • create\_sql\_query
\_chain only seems to accept “query” as input, but I’d like to pass a custom variable name like unvalidated\_query to th
e validation step. • For the validation prompt, it only takes inputs passed to the main invoke() function, so I’m unable
 to customize input/output names at each step.

Here’s the chain I’m trying to build:

`validated_query_chain = validati
on_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()`

`final_chain = RunnablePassthrough.assign( query=create_sql_query_chain,          
     validated_query=validated_query_chain, result=execute_query_chain ) | { 'answer': answer_back_to_natural_language_p
rompt | llm | StrOutputParser(), 'query': query, 'validated_query': validated_query }`

The goal is to have the chain re
turn the initial query, validated query, and final answer in natural language. Any insights on customizing LangChain’s b
uilt-in function names or managing input/output variables for each step?

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Open-source declarative framework to build LLM applications - looking for contributors ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gkpazh/p_opensource_declarative_framework_to_build_llm/) , 2024-11-11-0913
```
I've been building LLM-based applications, and was super frustated with all major frameworks - langchain, autogen, crewA
I, etc. They also seem to introduce a pile of unnecessary abstractions. It becomes super hard to understand what's going
 behind the curtains even for very simple stuff.

[So I just published this open-source framework GenSphere.](https://gi
thub.com/octopus2023-inc/gensphere) The idea is have something like **Docker for LLMs**. You build applications with YAM
L files, that define an execution graph. Nodes can be either LLM API calls, regular function executions or other graphs 
themselves. Because you can nest graphs easily, building complex applications is not an issue, but at the same time you 
don't lose control.

You basically code in YAML, stating what are the tasks that need to be done and how they connect. O
ther than that, you only write individual python functions to be called during the execution. No new classes and abstrac
tions to learn.

Its all open-source. **Now I'm looking for contributors** to adapt the framework for cycles and conditi
onal nodes - which would allow full-fledged agentic system building! Pls reach out  if you want to contribute, there are
 tons of things to do!

PS: [you can read the detailed docs here,](https://gensphere.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) And go o
