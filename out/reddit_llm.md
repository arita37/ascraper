```
Hi guys,
I'm working on a chatbot for our company and we use ChatGPT 4 as an LLM. To keep the costs per request low, I i
mplemented a chat history with only the last 6 messages (3 from user, 3 from bot)

The problem now is, that sometimes pe
ople have inputs that the bot can't answer well, as the messages are already gone in his memory.

Is there any good way 
to fix this? 
Is it possible to use vectorsearch for memory? Or does this heavily increase the latency?

What is the bes
t way to go, what are you guys using?

```
Hello,

Currently, I'm using LangChain to develop a ReAct agent to develop evidence-based arguments supporting the user'
s input. I've successfully developed a Tool that can access data from a web source based on what the model queries. ReAc
t seems like a sensible pattern for this use case, but the model gets stuck in a loop, repeatedly asking the same query 
of the tool. I've also noticed that the conversation history is not populated.

Here is the code I developed. The `searc
h_cse(query)` function just returns the title and text of an article.

    from keys import GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY

all -  [ RAG Retrieval Evaluation ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1co5cl1/rag_retrieval_evaluation/) , 2024-05-10-0910
```
Hey,

Like many others I am working on a RAG Q&A Chatbot.  I have many pdfs related to a certain topic. My goal is to he
lp the end-user answer questions based on the information in the pdfs. From the perspective of GIGO I am first evaluatio
n how well I can retrieve information related to certain questions. However, I am not certain about my approach.

I am u
sing precision at k, recall at k and ndcg at k as my evaluation metrics; next I simply create various pipelines starting
 from the raw pdfs, to embedding to retrieval. Here I vary the following element in the pipeline:

**Chunking:**

* Char
acterTextSplitter vs RecursiveTextSplitter
* Chuck size (400, 800, 1200)
* Chuck overlap (200, 400, 600)

**Embedding:**


* Model (ie. OpenAI vs Cohore)

**Retrieval:**

* Search method: mmr vs similarity
* Number of Documents to return \[k
\] (4, 7)
* Number of Documents to fetch to pass to MMR algorithm \[fetch-k\] (20, 40)

Retrieval is tested as follows; 
at the chunking stage I sample \~10% of the chucks and pass that to an LLM to generate questions. These are then used to
 test how well the pipeline can retrieve the chucks related to the questions.

**Now my problems:**

1. I consider a sin
gle pdf, one document. This document is then chucked, but the document ID is the same for each chuck. Meaning that if a 
question related to chuck A returns chuck Z; this would be counted as correct. While this would obviously not be correct
; I've considered changing the relation from a single page in a pdf being considered one document as this is likely more
 accurate.
2. The evaluation questions generated vary with the chuck size and method; as the given input to the LLM will
 be different. So while testing the pipeline, this is strongly affected by the quality of questions the LLM came up with
.

Are there people here with experience in testing, or does anyone know any good resources?

Thanks!

```
We are a fairly big group with an already mature MLops stack, but LLMOps has been pretty hard.

In particular, prompt-it
eration hasn't been figured out by anyone.  
what's your go to tool for PromptOps ?

## PromptOps requirement:

Requirem
ents:

* Storing prompts and API to access them
* Versioning and visual diffs for results
* Evals to track improvement a
s prompts are develop .... or ability to define custom evals
* Good integration with complex langchain workflows
* Traci
ng batch evals on personal datasets, also batch evals to keep track of prompt drift
* Nice feature -> project -> run -> 
inference call heirarchy
* report generation for human evaluation of new vs old prompt results

## LLM Ops requirement -
> orchestration

* a clean way to define and visualize task vs pipeline
* think of a task as as chain or a self-containe
d operation (think summarize, search, a langchain tool)
* but then define the chaining using a low-code script -> which 
orchestrates these tools together
* that way it is easy to trace (the pipeline serves as a highl evel view) with easy pl
uggability.

Langchain is does some of the LLMOps stuff, but being able to use a cleaner abstraction on top of langchain
 would be nice.

None of the prompt ops tools have impressed so far. They all look like really thin visualization diff t
ools or thin abstractions on top of git for version control.

Most importantly, I DO NOT want to use their tooling to ru
n a low code LLM solution. They all seem to want to build some lang-flow like UI solution. This isn't ScratchLLM for god
's sake.

Also no, I refuse to change our entire architecture to be a startupName.completion() call. If you need to be s
o intrusive, then it is not a good LLMOps tools. Decorators & a listerner is the most I'll agree to.

all -  [ Token Limits, Consistency, & LLM in Code ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1cnhxqt/token_limits_consistency_llm_in_code/) , 2024-05-10-0910
```
**If you don‚Äôt want to read:**

* How do I address token limits without reducing tokens? Also, can someone explain top p
?
* How to improve custom GPT consistency and quantitatively measure it? I heard about temperature but what else?
* Wher
e to start for implementing LLM in code?¬†

**Context**

TOKEN LIMITS - I need to input over hundreds of thousands or eve
n millions of tokens in a single run (via excel/csv file). Maximum split it up into like 5-10 runs. Despite higher token
 limits, it gets lazy, gives errors, etc.¬†

CONSISTENCY - Custom GPT outputs are inconsistent and I need more consistenc
y. I heard about temperature and gave GPT an examples set but its still fairly inconsistent and I want to know how to me
asure this more rigorously.

LLM in PYTHON - I have experience with Python but not LLM in python. Should I start with La
ngChain and what resources should I follow? I want to experiment with this although my main concern later on is my team 
doesn‚Äôt code so I don‚Äôt know how sustainable a 'code built model' would be in the long term.

...... 

THANK YOU!

all -  [ Using Airtable data as a vector database for Chatbot Knowledge Base ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1cnhb5a/using_airtable_data_as_a_vector_database_for/) , 2024-05-10-0910
```
Hello AI peeps, I need some help/advice. I‚Äôm building a fairly comprehensive chatbot which includes a RAG QnA component.
 All knowledge base data is in an Airtable, where each row/record is another piece of knowledge. 

The plan is to vector
ize the knowledge base to Pinecone via Flowise Upsert and then retrieve with OpenAI Embeddings. 

The main issue is that
 I can‚Äôt figure out how to use the columns as seperate metadata keys instead of all being vectorized in 1 piece. Is ther
e an easy solution to accomplish this? Is there a better approach overall to convert the data from Airtable into a RAG k
nowledge base? Any help would be appreciated! I mentioned Flowise because it‚Äôs the simplest way to use Langchain.

I am working on a ReAct agent that will have a couple of pre-defined tools to perform specific actions BUT we need to ha
ve some kind of 'default' or 'else' tool, what I mean is: if non of the pre-defined tools is selected by the agent then 
it will try to answer the user query using the 'else' tool, the idea is that there are some pre-defined and well known a
ctions that will be executed by the agent when tue user query matches those fine, but if there is not  a good match we s
till want the agent to be able to come up with the best answer possible(inbstead of something like: I cannot answer this
 question because I don't have a tool for it). Any ideas? I'm thinking on something as a   
`GeneralHandlerTool(BaseTool

```
Hey all

Im fairly new to langchain and langgraph and have a question about changing state attributes in conditional edg
e nodes  


i have this code, where im deciding if i like the answer, if i dont, i would like to return the state to ret
urn to, but also manipulate a state attribute

 

def decide\_if\_answer\_acceptable\_node(state: GraphState):  
 '''  

Determines if answer is acceptable  
   
Args  
state (dict): The current state of the graph  
   
Returns:  
str: Binar
y decision for the next node to call  
'''  
   
 if state\['answerok'\] == False or state\['answerok'\] == 'False':  
s
tate\['answer'\] = 'not OK' # <--- can i alter state attributes here?  
return 'noanswer'   
 else:  
return 'answer'   



And its linked like so:  


workflow.add\_conditional\_edges(  
 'answer\_grader\_llm\_node',  
 decide\_if\_answer\_
acceptable\_node,  
{  
 'noanswer': END,  
 'answer': END  
},  
)  


  
I understand i could blank the answer in the 
'noanswer' node, but i would like to understand if its possible to set this in the conditional edge function so i can ke
ep my code more compact?

&#x200B;

Thanks!

```
So, I made an information extraction system where basically, when I upload a technical data sheet of a construction mate
rial through streamlit, the LLM generates a text string in .csv format containing the attributes of the material that I 
defined to extract through the prompts (which are already embedded so it's not a Q&A system). And I linked the response 
with Gspread so that the string is automatically exported to google sheets in correct order. 

I tested and the prototyp
e is working as intended but the problem is with the evaluation of the system. Since it's part of a thesis project, I ha
ve to demonstrate how well the proposed system is performing based on certain metrics, but I am finding difficulty in lo
oking for a quantitively evaluated method that suits this use case scenario. What I want to do is to compare the perform
ances of different LLMs that are being used for the generation as well as assessing the retrieval portion of the system.


Obviously, I'm not well-versed in this area so any help is appreciated.

To my fellow experts, I am having trouble to extract tables from PDF. I know there are some packages out there that clai

ays on how to do that ? Or I have to a rite the code from scratch to process the tables but there seem to be many types 
of tables I need to consider. 

Here are the packages I tried and the reasons why they didn‚Äôt work. 

1. Pymupdf- messy 
table formatting, can misinterpret title of the page as column headers
2. Tabula/pdfminer- same performance as Pymupdf 

3. Camelot- I can‚Äôt seem to get it to work given that it needs to download Ghostscript and tkinter, which require admin 
privilege which is blocked in my work laptop. 
4. Unstructured- complicated setup as require a lot of dependencies and t
hey are hard to set up 
5. Llamaparse from llama: need cloud api key which is blocked 

I tried converting pdf to html b

Hey everyone! I recently wrote a blog post about¬†[Affiliate.ai](http://affiliate.ai/), a chat-based affiliate marketing 
analytics tool we've been working on. It simplifies the analytics process, letting you ask natural language questions an
d get insights, reports, and even spreadsheets delivered right within Microsoft Teams or Slack.

But the interesting par
t (for this audience, at least) is how it works under the hood. Here's a breakdown of some key elements:

* **Intent Dis
cernment with Function Calling:**¬†We use simple function calling to quickly determine whether a user wants data or is ju
st chatting, ensuring the bot stays focused.
* **LLM-Powered Named Entity Recognition:**¬†Instead of complex pipelines, w
e feed the LLM a list of advertisers and let it figure out the matches‚Äì surprisingly effective!
* **Query Reconstruction
 for Context:**¬†Understanding context is tricky. We use a dedicated module to rewrite queries based on chat history.
* *
*Parallelization for Speed:**¬†We run multiple potential routes simultaneously, speeding up response times dramatically.


Interested in the specifics? The full blog post has more details (link below). If you're building similar GenAI apps, I
'd love to hear about your approaches and techniques!

I used the Python LangChain UnstructuredURLLoader to retrieve all our products on the company website for RAG purpose
s. The products were on different pages in the company website.

UnstructuredURLLoader was able to retrieve the products
 in multiple Document objects before they were chunked, embedded and stored in the vector database.

With the OpenAI LLM
 and RAG module, I asked the AI, **'How many products in the company A?' AI replied 'There are 11 products. You should c
heck the company A website for more info...'**

If I asked 'Please list all the products in the company A', AI replied t
he list of the 11 products only.

The problem is, there are more than 11 products. Why can't LLM read and aggregate the 
products in the Documents to count and to return all of the products?

Is there any context hint or prompt to tell LLM t
o read and return all products? Is it because of the chunking process?

```
Hi All,

I'd be curious to discuss what peoples' thoughts would be on the following API to express their LLM workflows i
n place of LCEL. LangChain has the kitchen sink of things, so useful for that, but I haven't been fond of LCEL...

**LCE
L** - it's terse, but it pains me to come back to the code each time to figure out what it's going on. Then if I want to
 do anything complex it gets worse. Simple example from the docs:

    from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutp
utParser
    from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
    from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePass
through
    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
    
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
        'Tell me
 a short joke about {topic}')
    output_parser = StrOutputParser()
    model = ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-3.5-turbo')
    ch
ain = (
        {'topic': RunnablePassthrough()}
        | prompt
        | model
        | output_parser
    )
    if _
_name__ == '__main__':
        print(chain.invoke('ice cream'))

What about this **declarative API**, using a framework 
called [Hamilton](https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton/) (note: I'm one of the authors)- it's more verbose, but I ca
n always clearly see how things connect and make modifications --  Hamilton knows which function to call when stitching 
things together based on the  function name and function input arguments -- as you write functions you 'declare' what th
ey are and what they require.

    # hamilton_invoke.py
    from typing import List
    
    import openai
    
    
   
 def llm_client() -> openai.OpenAI:
        return openai.OpenAI()
    
    
    def joke_prompt(topic: str) -> str:
   
     return f'Tell me a short joke about {topic}'
    
    
    def joke_messages(joke_prompt: str) -> List[dict]:
     
   return [{'role': 'user', 'content': joke_prompt}]
    
    
    def joke_response(llm_client: openai.OpenAI,
        
              joke_messages: List[dict]) -> str:
        response = llm_client.chat.completions.create(
            mode
l='gpt-3.5-turbo',
            messages=joke_messages,
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content
    

    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        import hamilton_invoke
    
        from hamilton import driver
    
      
  dr = (
            driver.Builder()
            .with_modules(hamilton_invoke)
            .build()
        )
        
dr.display_all_functions('hamilton-invoke.png')  # see image below
        print(dr.execute(['joke_response'],
         
                inputs={'topic': 'ice cream'}))

This image (generated by Hamilton) represents how Hamilton stitches tog
ether the code to then run it

[Result of dr.display\_all\_functions\(\\'hamilton-invoke.png\\'\)](https://preview.redd.
it/tq5ms3ltj5zc1.png?width=702&format=png&auto=webp&s=048f54f953ab50996e459b93d034771d9a943c7c)

To see more comparisons
 (e.g. conditionally swapping anthropic for openai) [click here](https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/code-comparisons
/langchain/). For code that is both Hamilton & LangChain [see this example](https://hub.dagworks.io/docs/DAGWorks/conver
sational_rag/).

Now I wouldn't use Hamilton for a simple function call -- much like I wouldn't use LangChain for that e
ither.

I'm interested in discussing thoughts and opinions to see if there's (a) appetite for this style of API, and (b)
 therefore should we integrate more closely with LangChain.  Cheers!

Hey there, Redditors!

I'm back with the latest installment on creating deterministic LLM memory.

If you've been follow
ing along, you know I'm on a mission to move beyond the '[thin OpenAI wrapper](https://topoteretes.github.io/cognee/blog
/2023/10/05/going-beyond-langchain--weaviate-and-towards-a-production-ready-modern-data-platform/)' trend and tackle the
 challenges of building robust LLM memory.

  
That's why we built cognee, a python library to process documents and bui
ld knowledge graphs on top of them.

After a few weeks of work, we integrated DSPy and extended cognee.

Here is brief o
verview of the logic: 

[Architecture overview](https://preview.redd.it/fcs3lifx53wc1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=web
p&s=9316cba52147a5b764565b8438f3f143d8e7ac84)

We aim to understand:

1. Have you tried building knowledge graphs with o
ther tools before?

2. If so, what were the biggest obstacles?

3. How would you approach semantic linking of documents 
without knowledge graphs?

Hi all

I am presented with a problem that I need to solve using LLM to get the right data from text that has only \~20%
 structure to it. Here's a sample data

XXXXX

AA          BB

CCCC:  (optional DDDD)

C1......(A1) (B1)

C2......(A2) (
B2)

C3.....(A3) (B3)

I am required to anwer with either of these results from A1/B1 till A3/B3 pairs but in order to d
o that I need to go back and ask the user which one of the options C1 to C3 applies to him?

The above is not the most c
omplex structure, it increases in complexity from here so a lot of chatting with user is required to get to the right da
ta that will always exist in the chunk like above.

In the most simplist case the data structure will look like below

X
XXXX

AA          BB

CCCC: ......(A1) (B1)



How would you build a system like this? I am looking at multi-agent syste
ms with Langchain, what about prompt chaining?
