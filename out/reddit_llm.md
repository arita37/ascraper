Also when I set up langsmith w

```
I have built the implementation of my LLM app in python, so it’s really just text and API calls and whatever complex wor
kflows, chains, orchestration around the LLMs you can just program yourself. I’m curious what folks are doing out there,
 are they doing implementation themselves or using tools?

I know there’s dozens of tools out there like Langchain, Hays
tack, Adalflow, Flowise, Llamaindex, etc.

At the end of the day these are just complex workflows, but I feel like I’m s
pending more time debugging my code than just using something to iterate more quickly. 

Especially around Evals. If I h
ave the criteria to measure against such as unit tests and LLM as a judge. I just want a tool that can quickly send 100 
or 1,000 inputs into my workflow then measure the results. All the eval tools I’ve looked at are for simple one prompts,
 if I have a complex DAG like workflow of multiple chains, steps, etc what’s a good tool for this out there?

Is there a
n LLM stack folks are using out there to make this quicker/easier? Or is doing this orchestration in code just the best 
way for this.

The closest (payed) thing I’ve seen for this is Vellum.

```
Hi everyone.

Posting in this sub in hopes for some guidance. 
I’m an intern for this startup company and i’ve been task
ed to create a conversational ai agent for customer service.

I’ve been banging my head against the wall for two weeks n
ow reading the documentation and following so many tutorials and books, which many have become outdated now due to the d
eprecation of a lot of things in langchain. Also, the head of the team quit a long time ago and due to budget reasons th
ey’re hiring an intern (me lol) instead, so i have no subject matter expert to even guide or help me in any way. 

Pleas
e someone help me yall i’m legit desperate, tired, broke, dehydrated and trying my absolute best to land a job. 

I just
 feel so lost. 

Context: 

We’re supposedly using pinecone as the vector db and i’ll put the documents and build the re
spective knowledge base on it. 

Obstacle 1: I don’t know how the knowledge base should look like. The document manuals 
they have for company policies isn’t that good i think but yet again i have no caliber to judge whether this would be ok
ay to finetune the llm on or not. Depending on the issue the customer is facing, the llm would either respond accordingl
y or even call an api to get live info on the product shipping status.

Onto langchain, the big boss. I’m so lost on whe
ther i’m piecing the code correctly or not and the output isn’t really helping. 

Obstacle 2: I first used “Conversation
alRetreivalChain.from_llm “ after embedding one of their documents in a basic faiss db just to test the flow out. The ou
tput was okay but now it’s deprecated and i’m trying to use “create_retreival_chain” and “create_history_aware_retreiver
” but i cant seem to piece it to get the same output as before. 

Tried following a walkthrough in their documentation, 
wth is “create_retreiver_tool” and why is it a tool not a chain like the other? What’s the difference and idk which i sh
ould use. 

Obstacle 3: they deprecated “ConversationBufferMemory” and i’ve no idea now how to create an agent with memo
ry.  Trying to piece everything together and i also tried using “create_stuff_documents_chain” but still can’t get the o
utput to look like how it was when i used “ConversationalRetreivalChain”

Obstacle 4: what are all these prompts? I woul
d look at two tutorials that seem to be doing the same thing but one uses prompts and the other doesnt. I am honestly so
 confused at this point.

I could go on and on but i think these are my major obstacles. 

I would really appreciate jus
t any guidance at this point, please.

A bit of context:

I have computer science background and I *have some knowledge of Machine learning* but still not as p
rofound as you ;)

That being said:

Our usecase is to embed (vectorize)  documents -> and later based on queries retrie
ve the most relevant document.

Our current solution looks like:

* embedding using Titan model on Bedrock
* storing vec
tors on Pinecone

I am really eager to switch to Opensearch (you may ask why? we can discuss it in another thread :D).


But my concern is that: Pinecone is so trendy, and it is essentially designed for vector databases; although it is not t
he case for Opensearch.

**What will I lose by switching from Pinecone to Opensearch?**

my technical knowledge is limit
ed and I would like to ask your opinion on it, please.

(regarding the implementation: it is feasible using **knn\_vecto
r** s of Opensearch, have read some documents and workshops on it: e.g. [link](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integra

Bests ;)

Fellow Redditors,

I've asked this question on the LangChain Discord, but you know how it is—I usually get better respon
ses here on Reddit. So, here goes...

I'm encountering an issue with custom function streaming in LangChain's BaseTool u
sing `astream_events`. Looking for insights or potential solutions.

**Issue:**

* Standard LangChain chain streaming wo
rks fine.
* In custom variation: `run_manager.on_text` calls don't stream events in real-time.
* Events are collected by
 the tool before being sent, rather than streaming.

**Goal:**

* Achieve real-time event streaming from custom function
, similar to standard LangChain chains.
* Convert custom function to `RunnableLambda` for automatic callback handling.


**Resources:**

* Code example: [Gist](https://gist.github.com/sharrajesh/98238425679e648d3b15bb025c36ebeb)

Hey all,

I have the task of building a RAG system for one of the company departments to use. They will upload their fil
es and perform different tasks using agents. Now the requirement is that at least 11 people can use the system simultane
ously, along with an admin panel and some accounts being used by multiple people at once. I have 3 options to build it:


1. LC and Streamlit standalone app.  
2. LC + FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend  
3. LC + FastAPI backend and Nuxt
 frontend

My issue is that I don't have much experience building interfaces with Streamlit and from the very basic thin
gs that I have used it for it seemed quite slow and unpleasant as far as UX goes (although I am no expert with it so I m
ight very well be entirely responsible for the bad experience). So I am not sure how suitable Streamlit would be as a st
andalone application as far as concurrence usage goes and stress/load capabilities. I believe the 3rd option would be th
e best in terms of results, but the 1st and 2nd give the easiest maintenance as all would be python based.

Could you sh
are your opinions and advice please?

Edit:
My boss wants to go more for the 1st and if not the 2nd option beca
use of the easier maintenance as most guys on the team only use Python I guess. So the question of Streamlit's capabilit
ies to handle the stress load is the most important one in terms of making the choice..

I am creating a text2sql agent which on basis of user query finds the correct table and then executes the query get the 
results pass to a llm and return the response,It's giving a decent response for now but what I need to add on it these t
hings

1.I have to specify many guardrails on how the system should behave and what all  are it's do's and don'ts (kinda
 like a  project in Claude)

2.I also need to integrate additional knowledge base which the agent should use in order to
 get the appropriate info for creating the query 
Eg:If someone asks 'What is the best performing XYZ',the agent should 
know what all should be considered in order for something to be best etc

Can someone suggest on how I should move on to
 build a system like this

Hi, I am using the BM25 retriever alongside the Parent Document Retriever and combining the results afterwards. When I l
ook at the result of the BM25 retriever using the following code, I only get perhaps 1 out of 10 chunks which are releva
nt to my query. Why is that? Is my implementation wrong?

  
My 'docs' variable contains chunks from from 10 pdfs I have
 uploaded. However, it is only if I set BM25.k to a high number like 20, I get any relevant docs returned. The below exa
mple queries if the company 'TSMC' has a net zero target. When I run this, the first 8 or so documents returned do not e
ven mention the keyword 'TSMC' and are related to other companies.

  
`retriever = BM25Retriever.from_documents(docs)`


`returned_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents('Does TSMC have a net zero target?')`

  
I am using this in conjunct

```
I am building a RAG app with Langchain. The purpose is to be a chatbot for medical documents. I wrote a python file that
 loops through all the combinations of quite a few variables (e.g. embedding\_function, llm\_name, text\_splitting\_func
tion, chunk\_size, chunk\_overlap, etc.), runs the chatbot over a series of questions for each combination, and appends 
the results (e.g. question, answer, time\_elapsed) into a pandas dataframe. 

I set it up that the chat\_history gets sa
ved for the series of questions with this:

self.chat\_history.extend(\[HumanMessage(content=original\_question), AIMess
age(content=answer)\])

but the chat\_history gets redefined to an empty list for every new combination of variables. I 
also tried clearing the chat\_history with the .clear() method as well in different strategic parts of the python file.


However, I am noticing that the chat history is still getting saved or cached internally somehow and I'm not sure how t
o fix it. For example, when the loop iterates to a different file, it is returning an answer from one of the earlier fil
es. I tried debugging and stepping into the create\_retrieval\_chain.invoke method but every data structure seems to be 
empty and I'm not sure how langchain is remembering previous question and answers. I also set the argument memory=False 
in the llm so I feel confident it is not the llm that is somehow retaining the information.

Any ideas?

I am building a small tool to assist my team with the project we are working on. The idea is to be able to interact with
 it via a Discord channel, where users can ask it for different kinds of help. In a non-exhaustive fashion, those are:


1. Recall from chat history from Discord what decisions were made about some engineering problems and solutions that wou
ld be used.
2. Provide information about the project from the documentation or source code.
3. Provide ideas and code ex
amples for the implementation of coding solutions.
4. Update the knowledge base with new chats, documentation and source
 code updates.

What are the best ways to build contexts for each of those use cases? I've been using Pinecone to tokeni
ze everything from source code, to chat histories, to source code. Then using langchain build a RetrievalQA using embedd
ings from Pinecone and invoke it with a query. Is that really the best way to do it? I'm unsure if there's a better-suit
ed method for each of the use cases, as I see that Langchain supports conversation memory.

Also if the question is of m

 processing questions with NLP to extract tool calls from Langchain and try calling those tools.

Hey r/reactjs,

I wanted to share a project that some friends and I have been working on for the past few months. It's c
alled [KaibanJS](https://www.kaibanjs.com/), and it's an open-source framework for building AI multi-agent systems in Ja
vaScript, with a focus on React integration.

We started this project because we couldn't find a good native JS solution
 for working with AI agents that fit well with the React ecosystem. So, we decided to build one ourselves.

**Some key f
eatures:**

* Designed to work seamlessly with React and state management libraries
* Runs in the browser
* Includes a K
anban-style UI for visualizing agent workflows (think Trello for AI agents)
* Built on top of LangChain for robust orche
stration

We're still ironing out some details, but we'd love to get feedback from the React community. If you're intere
sted in AI and React, we'd be really grateful if you could check it out and let us know what you think.

You can find mo
re information and try it out here:

* Project website: [https://www.kaibanjs.com/](https://www.kaibanjs.com/)
* GitHub 
repo: [https://github.com/kaiban-ai/KaibanJS](https://github.com/kaiban-ai/KaibanJS)
* Quick start guide (video): [https
://youtu.be/NFpqFEl-URY](https://youtu.be/NFpqFEl-URY)

We're especially interested in hearing:

1. Is this something yo
u could see yourself using in a React project?
2. What features would make it more useful for your React workflows?
3. A
ny bugs or issues you notice?

Thanks in advance for any feedback.

I am looking for a way w

[NaturalAgents](https://github.com/NaturalAgents/NaturalAgents) is the easiest way to create AI Agents in a notion-style
 editor. It's no-code and enables anyone to build sophisticated agents using simple macros. It's current in its MVP stat
e, but it is fully open-source and will be actively maintained.

How this is different from other agent builders -

1. N
o boilerplate code (imagine langchain for multiple agents)
2. No code experience
3. Can easily share and build with othe
rs
4. Readable/organized agent outputs
5. Abstracts agent communications without visual complexity (image large drag and
 drop flowcharts)

But these feel overly reductive, since they don't address complexities like:  
1) when
 to retrieve vs. just respond immediately to reduce latency  
2) rely on existing context previously retrieved in the co
nversation instead of retrieving again at the current turn  
3) partition LLM context between retrieved information and 
past conversation history.

I'm sure some teams already have good systems for this, would appreciate pointers!

MachineLearning -  [ Built a web agent which call fill Google forms based on the user details [P] ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fozud5/built_a_web_agent_which_call_fill_google_forms/) , 2024-10-13-0913
```
GitHub repo : [https://github.com/shaRk-033/web-agent](https://github.com/shaRk-033/web-agent)

Tried to solve it using 
two approaches:

# 1: Basic Scraping and Filling

This is the straightforward approach. The agent scrapes the form’s HTM
L and uses fixed XPaths to find and fill in the required fields.

* It pulls the form’s HTML, locates the fields with se
t XPaths, and inputs the answers. It’s a direct and simple method.
* If the form changes or an element isn’t where it’s 
expected, the process can fail and may need manual adjustments.

[basic approach](https://preview.redd.it/5e8g4a1k4xqd1.

2. Using LangChain Agents and tool call
ing

* LangChain Agent**:** The agent handles everything by using the LLM’s reasoning to decide what to do next, includi
ng generating those tricky XPaths.
* Error Handling**:** If something goes wrong (like an element not found), the agent 
tries again with better XPaths until it gets the job done.

Any recommendations to improve this w
ould be welcome. Also, if anyone has ideas on building similar web agents to automate other tasks, it would be great to 
hear them. :)

MachineLearning -  [ [P] Swapping Embedding Models for an LLM ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1fktvbj/p_swapping_embedding_models_for_an_llm/) , 2024-10-13-0913
```
How tightly coupled is an embedding model to a language model?

Taking an example from Langchain's tutorials, they use O
llama's _nomic-embed-text_ for embedding and _Llama3.1_ for the understanding and Q/A. I don't see any documentation abo
ut Llama being built on embeddings from this embedding model. 

Intuition suggests that a different embedding model may 
produce outputs of other sizes or produce a different tensor for a character/word, which would have an impact on the res
ults of the LLM. So would changing an embedding model require retraining/fine-tuning the LLM as well?

I need to use a e
mbedding model for code snippets and text. Do I need to find a specialized embedding model for that? If yes, how will ll
ama3.1 ingest the embeddings?

deeplearning -  [ What is the best approach for Parsing and Retrieving Code Context Across Multiple Files in a Hierarc ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1fh58oz/what_is_the_best_approach_for_parsing_and/) , 2024-10-13-0913
```
I want to implement a Code-RAG system on a code directory where I need to:

* Parse and load all the files from folders 
and subfolders while excluding specific file extensions.
* Embed and store the parsed content into a vector store.
* Ret
rieve relevant information based on user queries.

However, I’m facing two major challenges:

**File Parsing and Loading
:** What’s the most efficient method to parse and load files in a hierarchical manner (reflecting their folder structure
)? Should I use Langchain’s directory loader, or is there a better way? I came across the Tree-sitter tool in Claude-dev
’s repo, which is used to build syntax trees for source files—would this be useful for hierarchical parsing?

**Cross-Fi
le Context Retrieval:** If the relevant context for a user’s query is spread across multiple files located in different 
subfolders, how can I fine-tune my retrieval system to identify the correct context across these files? Would reranking 
resolve this, or is there a better approach?

**Query Translation:** Do I need to use Something like Multi-Query or RAG-
Fusion to achieve better retrieval for hierarchical data?

\[I want to understand how tools like [continue.dev](http://c
ontinue.dev/) and [claude-dev](https://github.com/saoudrizwan/claude-dev) work\]
