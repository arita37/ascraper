```
I'm a current Computer Engineering Master's student focusing on AI/Machine Learning, and I've been applying to internshi
ps, but the only replies I ever get are if I have a referral. I got an interview with Salesforce for an AI internship be
cause of a referral and the it went well. So even though I don't know if I'll get the position I'm wondering why I can't
 get companies lower on the totem pole than Salesforce to give me an interview or OA.

I'm wondering if my resume format
 is bad and getting auto rejected or if I just don't have enough experience to make it in a competitive market (It could
 be a combination of both). I get the sense that my resume isn't even making it past recruiters. I see other people at l
east get interviews with these places, I'm wondering what they're doing that I'm not.

Any advice or tips would be great
ly appreciated. I haven't had much luck getting advice in other subs or having my resume refined by someone on Fiver for
 $60. For reference I am a US citizen (I know that can affect what recruiters do with applications).

I am creating a simple chat app with Haystack but like Langchain, Haystack is too much abstraction for a simple task.

S
o I was wondering if anyone knows of a way to implement memory for the chat app without using Haystack or Langchain?

Al
so, this is a simple chat app and not a document based chat app.

However, opportunities have been limited to say the least. I figure I can't be selective anymore and have bee

Any feedback on the resume itself would be greatly appreciated as well.
Thank you for your time.

Hi there,  
I am currently working on an AI agent project and need to scrape through my clients Linkedin contacts, to id
entify potential leads. As far as I am aware, there is no tool integration for LinkedIn. I have checked the LangChain an
d crewAI documentation, and could not find a tool there. I saw composio has a LinkedIn connector, but then you have to i
mplement your own tool logic (which is fine for me, I am a senior dev, but I have concerns about getting blocked on Link

Do you know of any other libraries or frameworks I can use? I am looking for free solutions, no lo

Hi everyone,

I’m currently working on building a production-ready RAG application. My primary is Azure OpenAI, but I’m
 open to other LLM integrations if necessary.

Key Requirements:
- Handling a large volume of internal documents.
- Feat
ures like question reformulation and reranking to improve retrieval accuracy.

Frameworks I’m Considering:
- LangChain
-
 Haystack
- Semantic Kernel

Do you have any recommendations on which framework is best suited for this use case? Am I m
issing any other frameworks that I should evaluate?

I’d appreciate your insights and experiences

My last post didn't get much traction so I hope this one does better. I believe this is my first time posting here, but 
I have posted on the resumes subreddit before. Looking for criticism/feedback on the latest iteration of my resume. 

I 
am looking for robotics/EE roles, and have been applying since the start of the fall semester, but no luck regarding get
ting interviews. No luck with internships either. A couple of pre-recorded video interviews but they didn't go anywhere.
 I am not sure what I am doing wrong, is it the fact that I am an international student, lack of experience, my resume, 
or all three.

I would also like advice on what roles in EE/robotics would best fit me, given my skills. I figure being 
specific will not get me anywhere hence the desperation.

Thanks again for your time.

Has anyone thought about adding a vertex DB to the voice pipeline rather than adding all entities exported in the prompt
 every time? Maybe we could have a plug-in that allows calling a langchain pipeline rather than an LLM directly, this wo
uld allow querying entities rather than having them in the prompt and could open up to a more complex multi agent setup

all -  [ Guide to Integrating LangChain with Ollama for Local AI Workflows ](https://www.reddit.com/r/u_KonradFreeman/comments/1hntzfb/guide_to_integrating_langchain_with_ollama_for/) , 2024-12-30-0913
```
For those seeking to transition from cloud-based AI services to a more private and cost-effective local setup, I have re
cently published a comprehensive guide on integrating LangChain with Ollama. This guide outlines how to build robust wor
kflows powered by locally hosted language models (LLMs). You can access the complete write-up here: [LangChain + Ollama 
Guide](https://danielkliewer.com/2024/12/27/langchain-ollama).

This resource serves as a valuable starting point for ex
ploring local AI workflows or considering alternatives to cloud-based solutions. I am happy to answer any questions or d
iscuss potential use cases in more detail.

To provide a preview, the final program created as part of the guide is incl
uded below. While I used the QwQ model in this implementation, the setup is flexible—you can easily swap in a different 
model by modifying the corresponding payload entry.

The project was designed with two main objectives:

1. Core Concept
 Mastery: To understand the fundamental principles behind building scalable AI workflows.
2. Enhanced Local Model Capabi
lities: To explore methods of improving locally hosted models, enabling them to match or surpass some of the functionali
ty of cloud-based alternatives.

Currently, the application leverages simple folders containing .json persona files. Fut
ure iterations could integrate a database for greater flexibility. Additionally, a React-based UI for persona customizat
ion could be implemented, similar to the functionality I developed in my Personagen project.

# Key Innovations

* Graph
-Based Logic and Reasoning: By simulating logic with graph structures, the workflow can enhance local model outputs. Thi
s involves using multiple LLM calls with a context tracker, implemented through a graph-based LLM-to-LLM structure. This
 reduces hallucinations and enables more advanced functionalities.
* Scalable Personas: The personas folder allows for s
eamless customization, enabling developers to define any desired attributes. These can range from predefined JSON struct
ures to dynamic outputs generated by LLM calls, facilitating more complex orchestration of nodes and subnodes.
* Optimiz
ed Workflow Execution: By utilizing LangChain asynchronously with topological sorting, the application chains prompts ef
ficiently, minimizing response times.

```
Ask: I notice there are popular libraries called LangGraph and LangChain which can be used to create agent based RAG mod
els very easily (there are tutorials online) but I see there arent many Libs for GO. How have developers using GO dealt 
with this problem? what kind of BE architecture best supports a build with Agentic RAG with a GO BE?

Context: I am curr
ently building an application that aims to explore text data using Gen AI, I have my core BE setup and I can store copio
us amounts of data and surface it to my FE with no issues (power of GO!!), but now I need the AI service that will allow
 for user queries to be ran against the data I have in my db store. I want to use Agentic RAG models such that the queri
es are as precise as possible and I want to test the merit of this AI architecture.

Ever wondered how AI can actually “understand” language? The answer lies in embeddings—a powerful technique that maps wo

Hello everyone,

I'm currently developing a PDF RAG app .

App's workflow is like : uploading a pdf , parsing it ( using
 pymupdf4llm ) , chunking it ( using Semantic Chunker ) , creating embeddings ( text-embedding-3-large ) , storing embed
dings to the Pinecone DB .

Now, along with the embeddings I store the original parsed markdown text to the PineconeDB .


This worked OK so far .

I want to develop this app into a multi modal RAG app . So I started researching how to build
 one .

I came across Alejandro's latest video ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrReyH5cu0](https://www.youtube.com/w
atch?v=uLrReyH5cu0) ) .

Here, what he's doing is storing the original chunk in a doc store and summary of the chunk in 
the vector store.

He used Langchain's InMemoryStore as the doc store . As it is an in memory store , it isn't scalable 
, I want something that persists. Came across Langchain's LocalFileStore .

According to Langchain official docs , It wo
rks on the local file system , if I have many users , then my app server will eventually become slow .

Can it be linked
 to AWS S3 or some other storage solution ?

If yes , then how ? are there any example implementations that you guys can
 refer me to ?

If no , then how do I build one ?

I want to build the doc store user specific .

User A has UserA\_DocS
tore  
User B has UserB\_DocStore

I have posted here before as well, an

 myself by brushing up on AutoOCAD, AutoCAD Electrical and Fusion. Is there anything else I can do to improve my resume?


I'd also appreciate any advice on what roles I should apply for, given my experience and skill set. I am open to gener

```
I'm new to langchain, and I was trying out langsmith. I tried to compare token usage from langchain to the OpenAI playgr
ound for assistants. The assistant I made has a system prompt and some functions.

I made a langchain/langgraph react ag
ent with the same setup.

I prompted the model to where it would trigger one of my function calls.


---

The total toke
ns via OpenAI playground were 1713 (1608 input, 105 output).

On langsmith, it shows 267 tokens (234 input/prompt, 33 ou
tput/completion).

The difference is drastic.

If I put the final AI response from the langsmith trace into OpenAI's tok
enizer, I get 33 tokens. 

If I go to the OpenAI Chat completions playground and put the system prompt and then my user 
message, no function calling or any additional padding, I get a total of 115 input tokens. In langsmith, it also shows 1
15 input tokens.

I believe the 119 remaining input tokens are likely the function call result being passed to the model
.

It seems that langsmith is not counting tokens beyond what is passed into the message history when invoking the agent
, as well as the tool result. It doesn't include the tokens from tool definitions, and I guess anything else that langch
ain/graph add into the input prompts. This means that as far as I can tell, there is no clear way to see the actual/real
 token consumption through langsmith.

Why is that? Is there a way to configure langsmith to include all tokens?

## Edi
t:

I think I figured it out! You need to enable `stream_usage` in your model, otherwise I guess langsmith doesn't recei
ve correct usage metrics? After enabling this, langsmith now shows the correct token usage.

In my case, it's `ChatOpenA
I(model='gpt-4o-mini', stream_usage=True)`

Hi all, some background: I'm a career switcher. Have an undergrad law degree from SOAS and an LLM from KCL (intellectual
 property law). 

Moved back to Singapore after graduating (not willingly, I couldn't get a training contract to qualify
 to practise English law, and this was when there was no graduate visa due to Theresa May reasons). I got qualled in Sin
gapore, practised commercial litigation for 3 years, realised I didn't like law very much, ditched it, learned to code, 


For some reason I did a data science bootcamp, then figured out I hated Jupyter notebooks, so I found a job as a data 
engineer. No idea how I convinced them that I could figure Scala out but 4 interviews later I got my current role as a S
cala Data Engineer and have been working in it for the last 9 months. 

I'm not exactly doing data engineering work per 
se, it's been all about building and maintaining a system for other data engineers to configure spark scala pipelines wi
th yaml/json and my code handles it (my fingers are still sore from the 300 pages of documentation). 

Recently, work fi
gured out I learned langchain when they weren't looking so they started getting me write python to throw AI into everyth
ing. I am having fun at work, but I'm looking ahead.

Separately, I do a bunch of random projects in my free time as wel
l, here's my personal GitHub:

https://github.com/Shredmetal

Here's where I'm at right now:

1. I want to move back to 
the UK, and honestly, while I can build a pile of stuff, my fundamentals in data structures and algorithms could use wor
k, like, a lot of work. I go play leetcode for fun when I'm not working on some project and pay for LC premium for edito
rials and explanations on how the solution works under the hood (python abstracts away a lot of stuff)

2. I suspect a l
ot of jobs are closed off to me because they see 'bootcamp' and go lol no.

3. I am considering a CS degree of some sort
. I'm not getting any younger, so a 3-year undergrad degree is out of the question.

4. Therefore, I'm wondering if a CS
 masters is the way forward, or if there are other computing degrees worth pursuing in order to actually seek employment
 in the UK.

Advice? Thanks!

```
Hey Supabase community! 👋

Remember that simple AI chat template I shared earlier? Well, it just got a major upgrade! I'
m excited to announce that we've added document chat capabilities (RAG) while keeping true to our core principle: keepin
g things simple and straightforward.

What's New in v1.7.0:

# 🎉 Document Chat (RAG) Features:

https://preview.redd.it/
g4aez3jjb79e1.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=f29ace8a181e210bbdd0766287c77556f4e002a2

* Chat with your documents
 using our simple RAG implementation
* Upload PDFs and DOCX files with ease
* Smart document processing using LlamaCloud

* Vector storage with Pinecone
* Interactive split-screen interface
* Click-to-navigate source references
* Contextual 
embeddings for improved relevancy

# 🚀 Core Features:

* Supabase Auth with SSR
* Multiple AI model support (GPT-3.5, GP
T-4, Claude AI Sonnet)
* Efficient chat history with pagination
* Enhanced chat interface with streaming responses
* Doc
ument viewer with source highlighting

# 📑 Smart Document Processing Pipeline:

We've implemented a robust document proc
essing flow that circumvents serverless function limitations:

1. Client directly uploads document to Supabase Storage
2
. API route fetches the document from Supabase Storage and sends to LlamaCloud
3. Background polling checks LlamaCloud p
rocessing status every 10 seconds
4. Once processing is complete, we:
   * Download processed markdown from LlamaCloud
 
  * Generate contextual embeddings
   * Store in Pinecone
   * Ready for semantic search and chat!

Why this approach? S
erverless functions have a 4.5MB payload limit, which can be restrictive for larger documents. By uploading directly to 
Supabase Storage first, we can handle documents of much larger size while maintaining a smooth user experience. However,
 there are still limits on how long a process can run. An example would be Cloudflare have a 100s cutoff timer. It is ge
nerally recommended to host your own server somewhere handle uploading using this.

1.png?width=336&format=png&auto=webp&s=abf6770a809b5f8baee8c3e81911fa096367cb83

Who It's For:

* Developers who need bo
th chat and document QA capabilities
* Teams looking to build document-aware chatbots
* Anyone who wants to implement RA
G without reaching for tools that overcomplicates everything ( I'm talking about you Langchain...)

The Goal: To provide
 a starting point for projects that require authentication, AI chat, and document chat capabilities. It's completely fre
e, as we don't believe in charging $299 for templates (looking at you, Shitfast).

```
I am working on a GraphRAG tool. My PDF contains tables too. I can create regular chunks out of the rest of the text bas
ed on a markup splitter. Now how do I consider the tables in the PDF and importantly, their position in the PDF too?  
F
or example, I dont want the tables to be separately read and embedded as text, but I want them to be embedded as present
 in their respective sections of the PDF.

all -  [ ChatOllama doesn't call Tool ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1hmkz59/chatollama_doesnt_call_tool/) , 2024-12-30-0913
```
Hi everyone, I am currently working on migrating to ChatOllama and following one of LangChain's [tutorials](https://pyth
on.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/ollama/#tool-calling). 

    from typing import List
    
    from langchain_oll
ama import ChatOllama
    from typing_extensions import TypedDict
    
    
    def validate_user(user_id: int, addresse
s: List) -> bool:
        '''Validate user using historical addresses.
    
        Args:
            user_id: (int) the
 user ID.
            addresses: Previous addresses.
        '''
        return True
    
    
    llm = ChatOllama(
   
     model='llama3.1:70b-instruct-fp16',
        base_url='http://localhost:11434/',
        temperature=0,
    ).bind_t
ools([validate_user])
    
    result = llm.invoke(
        'Could you validate user 123? They previously lived at '
   
     '123 Fake St in Boston MA and 234 Pretend Boulevard in '
        'Houston TX.'
    )
    result.tool_calls

However
, I am not getting the expected output. This is the output I got:

`[]`

Instead of the expected output:

    [{'name': 
'validate_user',
      'args': {'addresses': '['123 Fake St, Boston, MA', '234 Pretend Boulevard, Houston, TX']',
      
 'user_id': '123'},
      'id': '40fe3de0-500c-4b91-9616-5932a929e640',
      'type': 'tool_call'}]

  
Does anyone know
 what might cause the model to not call the tool, resulting in an empty result.tool\_calls array?

Are there AI code editors that work with LangChain and LangGraph? For example, one can describe the use case, specify th
e use of LangChain/LangGraph, and then the editor will write the initial code for you.

 scenario, user uploads pdf book, and later asks question: “who are main characters in this book?”, what is approaches y
