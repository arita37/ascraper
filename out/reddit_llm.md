Something I think that's missing from Langchain documentation is good examples for how to reliably test your chains/chat
s/whatever without actually using a real LLM (costly/slow/unreliable).

I created an example (with Dockerfile included) 
on how to test an LLMChain with a brief conversation including a ConversationBufferWindowMemory.

Please let me know wha
t you think! If you have other requests, let me know.

```
I have a pretty good LangChain RAG model up and running, and some users asked if it's possible to include the names and 
URLs of the documents they would like the LLM to search for in the query. 

Something like:

Human query: 'Using only th
e data sheet of product X, can you confirm that ....'

Programmatically speaking, I know that I can define the search fi
lters in the retriever, but I am not sure what is the best way to have the LLM detect the document the user is referring
 to first. 

A naive approach here would be to do this outside of the chain, and preprocess the query before sending it 
to the RAG model (alongside any search filter metadata, if applicable). Is that the recommended approach? What about age
nts, would that be too much for this use case?

The issue here is that the retriever output doesn't include metadata like 'URL' or 'published\_date'. I don't know how t
o incorporate that using RunnablePassthrough or RunnableParallel and/or 'lambda' ?  
I know that I can have the metadata
 this way:  
docs = retriever.invoke(query)  
for doc in docs:

Hey guys.  


Some Youtuber criticised LangChain saying it's not production ready. He said the the following: 'It abstra
cts away too many details from you, which makes it super hard to customize for a specific real world use case. Besides, 
it was released before function calling models, so there is no type validation, which is essential in production to prev
ent hallucinations.'  

Do you guys agree here?  


Do you think LangChain can be used in production already or are ther
e crucial steps making LangChain and possibly any other framework a hobby project for now?

Hi,

I want to manually create a Evaluation dataset for RAG with complex Pdfs. I already tried synthetic dataset creatio
n but think you get more reliable evaluation results with human labeled data (e.g. experts on a specific topic, so they 
knlw which questions they would ask and which answers they would expect).

As human annotation is costly I want to discu
ss important Things to consider when starting.

My plan would be: 
- go through Pdf and Ask 10 questions per document
- 
Answer every question based on the informations from the doc

But how would you evaluate the retriever? You somehow woul
d need to also extract the context (for RAGAS it would be 'ground_truths'). For manual annotation, should the annotator 
just copy the page where the relevant context is inside?

Another interesting thing would be how to answer more complex 
questions, e.g. where the true answer is stored on muliple different pages of the document.

Thanks for all suggestions!

But when i use the same code outside of django such as in jupyter notebook, it work well and sp
lit the text.

text)

Hi,

We are doing RAG on ecological reports. Most of them are in PDF format. Much of the data is in tables, often with j
oined cells. I have had a lot of difficulty converting these to a text format that ChatGPT would understand. After tryin
g out all available python libraries for PDF to text, I ended up with pymupdf. I use a lot of tricks to extract the tabl
es (because there are often more than one per page) and then convert them to markdown format. The text snippets are then
 uploaded to Azure Search together with a bunch of metadata. It works ok, but processing takes a little time and Azure S
earch is crazy expensive. 

I just got a GPT4 license and tried uploading a report together with a question related to a
 complicated table in the document. The answer was spot on and processing was very fast. 

We cannot use OpenAI privacy 
reasons, otherwise it would be the best solution for my clients.  Azure's OpenAI API does not allow documents to be uplo
aded and MS copilot studio / graph fails in its answers. 

Is there a solution to this problem that I don't know about? 
Has anyone any idea on how OpenAI manages to process PDFs when all other libraries fail?

**How do I improve my codebase reading skills in Python?** 

For the last 6 months or so I've been learning Python and c
an write decent code using OOP but find it extremely hard to understand somebody else's code. Specifically, I was using 
the Langchain python library to build an MVP tool and since only basic tutorials are available for it, I thought of goin
g through the codebase to understand how more specialized implementation can be done but I got completely lost in the co
de. Couldn't understand a thing. 

This isn't true for just Langchain, I'm unable to understand other codebases in gener
al (I've tried reading python code for other packages but to no avail).

Guidance on this would be really helpful!

. This project is a standalone effort to reimagine Langchainâs capabilities within the Rust ecosystem, which is renowned
 for prioritizing safety and performance.

Take a look here: https://github.com/Abraxas-365/langchain-rust 

This is a p
ersonal initiative, not an official port, reflecting my ongoing quest to enhance my technical know-how and engage with i
nnovative language model applications. Iâm eager to discover what possibilities this project might unlock and I warmly i
nvite you to check out the repository, share your insights, or consider contributing. Your feedback and contributions ar
e not only welcome but also highly valued as they contribute to the enrichment of both the project and the broader commu

```
I appreciate the anti-langchain post as much as anyone, but in the spirit of optimism, I'd like to talk about what every
one wants to build and improve instead :)

I often hear 'Oh LLMs can do <x> easily, just ...' But once you start buildin
g, the complexities pile up quickly!

So for a fun Sunday discussion, what is your dream framework for working with lang
uage models?

For me, I'm mostly anti-framework these days, and prefer a more building blocks that you can pick and choo
se from. Here's some pain points off the top of my head:

* Context Management: I built a small LLM context manager tool
 to handle chat history, RAG, and other data. It worked well until I built a full app, and now I feel the pain from not 
being able to tweak it for each instance (influence scores easily, order, etc) and determine what was included in the li
mited context.
* Chains/Loops: I built a small-ish chain library so I could write custom prompts and loop them. It's kin
d of useful, but I found that many of the chain 'entries' need to be custom functions to control the flow. Seems nearly 
impossible for someone else to work with haha
* File Import: I used pymupdf since it seemed to give lower-level access t
o PDFs, enough that I could generate markdown w/ headings from files. Extracting images and tables in-line seems difficu
lt, and multi-column pages are a disaster. I'd love a library to convert any document to markdown.
* Chunking: I made a 
custom markdown chunking function so I could break it up by headings and include headings/doc title metadata in the chun
ks. It's still messy and I feel the limitations every time I use RAG.

There are also some higher level problems I'm int
erested in:

Handling chat/rag/agents smoothly - so the LLM will respond quickly when it can, use rag when necessary, an
d use assistant/agent loops otherwise.

Understanding multi-turn RAG/agents. For example, how do you handle a RAG questi
on and then a generic follow up with less context? The first message returns a bunch of results, and the second message 
returns none ('Ok, what's the second part mean?'). Do you keep including the original RAG data in the context, and keep 
filling it with more data as the chat continues? My RAG and assistant chats feel like one-shot instead of smooth convers
ations.

How about everyone else? What do you currently use, what are your pain points, and do you have a dream tool?

I
n the end, do we just have to roll our own custom libraries for each use case?

```
I have been using ada for a while now with a Faiss store and it has been doing well. 

Today I tried text-embedding-3-la
rge today and the scores are weird. 

The correct match with ada gets a score of ~0.2 (0 being the best match and 1 bein
g the worst match) 
The correct match with text-embedding-3-large gets a score of ~0.5 

The full ordering from score 0-
1 seems to be better than ada. But the there is a shift towards a score of 1. 

Has anyone experienced that? Or has any 
explanation?

I've recently had time to dive into the Langchain library for creating a simple chatbot with memory (previously I've jus
t used GPT4 APIs with my own abstractions).

I don't understand, really... Am I stupid or Langchain is completely unusab
le due to the incredible overengineering efforts? Also - wow, documentation and practical examples are soooo terrible!


There's just too much abstraction depth. I don't wanna blame the Langchain devs or anything, it's just my general feelin
g. Also - did I mention how confusing, hard-to-read and unclear the documentation is?

If shooting your foot with a C++ 
gun blows your whole leg off...

I feel that - shooting your foot with Langchain blows your both legs off and, additiona
lly, tears you apart in half.

Hey there, Redditors!

I'm back with the latest installment on creating dependable AI data pipelines for real-world prod
uction.

If you've been following along, you know I'm on a mission to move beyond the '[thin OpenAI wrapper](https://top
oteretes.notion.site/Going-beyond-Langchain-Weaviate-and-towards-a-production-ready-modern-data-platform-7351d77a1eba40a
ab4394c24bef3a278?pvs=4)' trend and tackle the challenges of building robust data pipelines.

After a few months of work
, we integrated cognitive architecture with [keepi.ai](https://www.keepi.ai) 

We aim to explore with our demo:

**1. Co
ntext sanitization**  
The world of AI is fast-moving, and we've realized that the context is becoming a building block 
we refer to as a crucial part of future cognitive architecture.  
**2. Best Practices for AI Memory**  
In this rapidly 
evolving landscape, there are no established best practices. You'll need to make educated bets on tools and processes, k
nowing that things will change. We assume that having traditional data engineering practices + frameworks + classifiers 
and other AI solutions can solve a lot of standard hurdles  
**3. AI Frameworks**  
They are trying to do too much, too 
fast, too broad. We want to find a pattern and a correct layer of abstraction for the AI memory to fit new industry.

I've tried things like langchain in the past (6-8 months ago) but they were cumbersome and didn't work as expected.

I  
need RAG to get data from various pdfs (long one, 150+ pages) - and i  need a setup that will allow me to add more and m
ore data sources.

I wanna run this locally, can get a 24gb video card (or 2x16gb ones) - so i can run using 33b or smal
ler models.

I  know things in the industry change every 2 weeks, so i'm hoping there's  an easy and efficient way of do

I have to do is provide it with a pdf containing information about me such as my experience, skills, projects, etc and i

deeplearning -  [ DSPy Explained! ](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1adypks/dspy_explained/) , 2024-02-28-0909
```
DSPy is the next big advancement for AI and building applications with LLMs!

Pioneered by frameworks such as LangChain 
and LlamaIndex, we can build much more powerful systems by chaining together LLM calls! This means that the output of on
e call to an LLM is the input to the next, and so on. We can think of chains as programs, with each LLM call analogous t
o a function that takes text as input and produces text as output.

DSPy offers a new programming model, inspired by PyT
orch, that gives you a massive amount of control over these LLM programs. Further the Signature abstraction wraps prompt
s and structured input / outputs to clean up LLM program codebases.

DSPy then pairs the syntax with a super novel compi
ler that jointly optimizes the instructions for each component of an LLM program, as well as sourcing examples of the ta
sk.

Here is my review of the ideas in DSPy, covering the core concepts and walking through the introduction notebooks s
howing how to compile a simple retrieve-then-read RAG program, as well as a more advanced Multi-Hop RAG program where yo
u have 2 LLM components to be optimized with the DSPy compiler! I hope you find it useful!
