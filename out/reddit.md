```
beginner in llms here. i have been trying to make sense of the lifecycle of a model. here's what i have:

- people usual
ly release their models via huggingface, similar to other ml models.

- these are often too big and need to be quantized
 to be able to run on cpu-s or consumer gpu-s. this is done by a library such as ggml ( is exllama an alternate?)

- the
n the llms can be used as part of larger pipelines, like retrival-augmented-generation, or in agents. libraries like lan
gchain help for these pipelines.

- when making a frontend like a conventional chatbot, libraries like oogabooga help.


- for specific parts of particular pipelines like RAG, llamaindex and unstructured.io provide dedicated facilities ( dea
ling with different types of documents etc)

can anyone correct me here. also would invite people to add other big names
 i dont know of that are significant parts of the ecosystem

```
I've recently started out with LangChain, and I'm struggling with an issue. Although the code seems correct, the output 
is quite questionable. Here's my current code:

```
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI 
from langchain_experim
ental.plan_and_execute import PlanAndExecute, load_agent_executor, load_chat_planner 
from langchain.llms import OpenAI 

from langchain import SerpAPIWrapper 
from langchain.agents.tools import Tool 
from langchain import LLMMathChain 

mod
el = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0613', verbose=True,openai_api_key='...') 

search = SerpAPIWrapper(
serpapi_api_key='...') 

llm_math_chain = LLMMathChain.from_llm(llm=model, verbose=True) 

tools = [ 
    Tool( 
       
 name = 'Search', 
        func=search.run, 
        description='useful for when you need to answer questions about cur
rent events. You should ask targeted questions' 
    ), 
    Tool( 
        name='Calculator', 
        func=llm_math_ch
ain.run, 
        description='useful for when you need to answer questions about math' 
    ) 
] 

planner = load_chat_
planner(model) 
executor = load_agent_executor(model, tools, verbose=True) 
agent = PlanAndExecute(planner=planner, exec
utor=executor, verbose=True) 

agent.run('Who is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend? What is her current age raised to the 0.43 p
ower?')
```

During the Find her current agestep, the response was:

Based on the search results, it seems that Leonardo
 DiCaprio has been linked with a 19-year-old model named Eden Polani. However, I couldn't find any specific information 
about her current age. It's possible that her age is not widely known or publicly available. 

Clearly, the model mentio
ns her age but fails to recognize it in the following statement. It's perplexing, given that this example is directly fr
om the documentation. Did I miss something?

For reference, I initially attempted the example without the experimental l
ibraries:

```
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0613', verbose=True,openai_api_key='sk-u98IvxbZscoIP
3KloWn8T3BlbkFJVRBBHt9T34BNmtjbZmUt')
search = SerpAPIWrapper()
llm_math_chain = LLMMathChain.from_llm(llm=llm, verbose=
True)

tools = [
    Tool(
        name = 'Search',
        func=search.run,
        description='useful for when you ne
ed to answer questions about current events. You should ask targeted questions'
    ),
    Tool(
        name='Calculato
r',
        func=llm_math_chain.run,
        description='useful for when you need to answer questions about math'
    )

]

agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.OPENAI_FUNCTIONS, verbose=True)

```

Here, the output was:

  
  'Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend ** 0.43'

It seems to first calculate the math part, which again, is not as per the documen
tation.

Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.

```
I have tried with LLAMA2-7B 8 bit quantized, Gorilla 7b ggml 8bit models. It integrates correctly with Langchain. I adde
d two tools Wikipedia and DuckDuckgo search. I asked it when was Barrack Obama born? Straight forward question. 

The Ac
tion it outputs is not restricted. It should output 
Action:DuckDuckgo 
Action Input: Barrack Obama birthday

Instead it
 outputs 
Action: DuckDuckgo Barrack Obama birth date 

And some other stuff in action Input like barrack Obama's birthd
ay correct year etc. 

The problem is Langchain needs an exact match and not a fuzzy match. Hence it says such a tool do
es not exist and does not do the search. 

I am checking if anyone has ever got Langchain Agents working with GGML model
s and could figure out a way to output properly ( in a reproducible manner).

I've been using Llama 2 13b on a RTX 2080. I want to use langchain to get the models to use tools. It's not working, I'm
 getting a failed to parse error and on investigating I read that it may be because the model is not fine tuned to follo
w instructions. Looking on Hugging Face I found instruct versions of Llama 2 70b but no Llama 2 13b instruct. Does such 
a model exist? Or is there any way to get a smaller model to use tools with langchain because I don't think it is possib
le for me to run the 70b model on a RTX 2080.

Hey everyone,

I’m a software engineer by trade and I was recently placed on a project with AI and LLMs and I enjoyed it
 pretty thoroughly. My one nag is that I realize this is a bit of a fad and I personally just would like to get a better
 understanding of how these technologies work and not just know how to call functions as part of the langchain framework
. Plus I could get skills that last longer than the cycle of this AI craze and have things that carry over beyond the sc
ope of this type of work. I’m close to GTech and I know there school is a very accredited institution so getting into gr
ad school there is no walk in the (Piedmont) park especially for smth like ECE/CS. For context, my undergrad gpa was 3.1
 from UIUC in ECE so maybe if anyone knows of any universities with higher chances of getting in for a AI/ML program dro
p them below and let me know your thoughts/challenges for those of you who have gone back to school while working full t
ime

Cheers

```
So I've been working to build a conversational chatbot that totally feels 'human-like'. It should ideally be indistingui
shable from a human being.

For this, I looked at how people use open source llms for roleplay tasks. Here, they basical
ly feed a 'character personality prompt' to the LLM and ask it to continue a conversation with a user.

I did this in th
e beginning, the results were good, but still, it wasn't too hard to identify that it was an AI model. 

I used Langchai
n for all this btw, so it was easy to add conversational memory as well.

So after this, I created a seperate conversati
on chain in Langchain. I fed the conversation to this chain and asked it to analyse the chatbot's emotions and give it a
n 'emotion score' of sorts.

Then, I fed this to another conversation chain and asked it to rewrite the chatbot's previo
us response in accordance with the emotion score generated earlier.

(These 3 chains are the 'pipeline' I mentioned lol)


The results are definitely better than how they were before, but obviously, inference is way slower.

What do you guys
 think of this? Does it seem excessive and inefficient?

Is there something better I can do?

 store (which holds the machine user manuals).

I have 2 separate examples which provide a chat interface based on the S
QL and ConversationalRetrieval chain (from VectorDB). Both examples work beautifully well. 

Problem starts once I add b
oth these to the Agent. This agent is supposed to decide and make calls to the necessary chain, and get the answer. Whil
e at times it works as expected, the overall accuracy is extremely bad, and it also takes a lot of iterations (sometimes
 exhausting max iterations) in the process. Also the quality of responses if bad as well.

&#x200B;

I am trying to figu
re out ways to make the agent more reliable. It would be a great help if anyone can suggest ways to tweak behaviour of a
gents. I have also tried all the agents types, including OPENAI Functions, but still it is far from the satisfactory lev
els.

Below is my code. 

    # Init SQLite DB
    db = SQLDatabase.from_uri('sqlite:///db/example.db')
    embeddings =
 OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
    
    # Init vector store
    client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient(
 
       QDRANT_HOST,

    vector_store = Qdrant(
        client=client, 
        col
lection_name=QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME, 
        embeddings=embeddings
    )
    
    vectorstore_info = VectorStoreInfo(
 
       name='documents store',
        description='A repository of the documents which holds machine manuals. When answ
ering also include a list of source documents in the answer.',

all -  [ LLMs for Classification ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/15ewuzv/llms_for_classification/) , 1690849235.0
```
Is there any way to use LLM's for classification in the sense that given a prompt the LLM outputs an integer in a set G.
 For example G={0,1} for binary classification or G={1,...,K} etc. I have tried using LLM's for some tasks such as answe
ring yes or no questions or classifying a piece of text but often the LLM will not answer just yes/no or give the classi
fication, but it includes other text, like 'Sure, here is the answer, this piece of text should be classified as X'. Thi
s inclusion of unnecessary information makes it difficult to analyse the responses. I thought maybe you could do somethi
ng like this using some of the work on getting LLMs to use tools (like WolframAlpha) i.e. if it had an API it could call
 that sets a bit to 0 or 1.

EDIT: looking at langchain tools

all -  [ Question answering over custom log files? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/15eqvhr/question_answering_over_custom_log_files/) , 1690834786.0
```
I have an application that runs C# and C++ code. For each run, a logfile is produced as a regular .txt or .log file that
 shows exactly which methods were called in the program, where anything failed if at all, values for variables at runtim
e, etc.

I've been using LangChain with the Llama 13B-chat model, and it seems to work OK for querying documents that ar
e written in plain English, such as PDF files. My custom log files are not written in plain English--they follow a certa
in format, include method signatures, and more. Basically, they are comprised of technical language and not novel-type t
ext, such as what you might see in a typical PDF or other standard document file.

I'd like the combination of LangChain
 + Llama to perform well on answering questions about these custom .txt/.log files that all follow a specific format. Th
ese questions may include 'What went wrong?', 'What was the user hoping to accomplish in this run?', 'Why did this metho
d fail?', 'What is a potential fix for this situation?', etc. This seems to be a little more involved that a basic seman
tic search, although I could be wrong.

What's the best way to go about achieving this in LangChain? Would it be as simp
le as modifying a prompt/prompt template? Would it be more involved and require fine-tuning my model entirely in order t
o accommodate for this custom formatting of the log files? Something in between?

Note that these log files can get rath
er long. Does this mean that it would not be feasible to include one of them in a prompt and tell the LLM 'Here is the l
og file, the user will ask questions about it.' ? The TL;DR here is **how can I get LangChain to help me analyze custom 
log files that have been generated from custom code?** A point in the direction of some code somewhere that perhaps solv
es a similar issue would be very helpful.

all -  [ How to extract relevant passages from a text document using multiple additional text documents as co ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/15dvofv/how_to_extract_relevant_passages_from_a_text/) , 1690749240.0
```
I'm a developer that's relatively new to this space looking to solve a very challenging problem. I'm looking to build a 
tool that can pick out relevant passages from a source text document (which could be hundreds of pages in length). To he
lp the model understand what is relevant, I want to have it consume other text documents of varying formats and length (
pdf, docx, etc.), then use the context from 'understanding' those documents to pull out passages form the source documen
t that seem 'relevant'.

I will need to perform this operation in isolation, meaning, the source document and 'context' 
documents will need to be run once without the need to retrain the base model. Each execution will theoretically be run 
against a new set of source/context documents without previous executions/documents tainting the output of the current o
ne.

Example: the source document could be an interview transcript, with the 'context' documents containing information 
relevant to the specific subject matter of the interview.

I know this is a very challenging problem that could take a l
ong time to build (and could be very expensive to run), so I'm hoping folks with more relevant expertise in this area co
uld possibly point me in the right direction to some potential tools and/or approaches. I'll eventually be able to secur
e more resources and experts to help with this once I can start to prove out the basic concept.

I'm starting to play ar
ound with langchain/chroma applied over top of a base pre-trained LLM, but the amount of data from these context documen
ts could be very large (dozens or even hundreds of text documents that could be dozens or hundreds of pages in length), 
which is where I'm struggling to find information that can inform my approach here.

can also be used to filter the results of the model's inference.*

I|5|5|3|5|
|Bard|4|5|4|4|
|Huggingface|5|5|4|5|

**Evaluation:**

* Accuracy: Perplexity AI and Huggingface provided the
 most accurate technical explanations of how tools like LangChain work. Bing Chat had some inaccuracies, while Bard was 
mostly correct but lacked some details.
* Clarity: All models except Bing Chat expressed themselves clearly and were eas
y to understand.
* Conciseness: Bing Chat was the most concise, while Perplexity AI provided a very detailed explanation
 but was less concise.
* Helpfulness: Perplexity AI and Huggingface gave the most helpful responses that directly answer
ed the question. Bing Chat was the least helpful.

**Summary**:

Huggingface performed the best overall by providing an 
accurate, clear, reasonably concise, and very helpful response. It gave a detailed technical explanation while still bei
ng easy to understand.

* Perplexity AI also did very well, with an extremely accurate and helpful response, but was sli
ghtly less concise than ideal.
* Bard performed decently, giving a mostly correct response with good clarity, but lacked
 some important details.
* Bing Chat performed the worst - while concise, it had inaccuracies and lacked helpfulness.

S
o in conclusion, Huggingface demonstrated itself as the most capable model for providing knowledgeable, well-rounded exp
lanations to technical questions like this. Perplexity AI also did great, with room for improvement on conciseness. Bard
 was decent, while Bing Chat clearly lagged behind the others.

# Prompt: (Sourced from a Random Reddit Post)


*Can someone please clarify this to me: Are tools like LangChain interacting with the model (memory) directly, or it's 
all just prompting behind the scenes and filtering the results to only include the complete answer ?*

*Context: I'm pla
ying with LLMs and I'm trying to understand the currently existing solutions for extending the model capabilities beyond
 the prompt and current context.*

*I can't find a clear answer, and I'm just trying to find out the basic flow of thing
s.*

*I know you can load embeddings with a model and it treats that as a part of it's model, but this does not make sen
se in case of dynamic data, like things fetched from vector db.*

*Basically the actual question is: Can you feed dynami
c data into the running model, at runtime, and directly in memory without prompting ?*

*I know you CAN do prompting 'in
 the background', and parse it's outputs, but for a simple PC that does 5-6 t/s just with chat, doing additional inferen
ce will drop that resultant t/s way down below a usable level, so I'm looking for a best solution performance-wise here.

**Evaluation:**

* Accuracy: Perplexity AI and Huggingface provided the
 most accurate technical explanations of how tools like LangChain work. Bing Chat had some inaccuracies, while Bard was 
mostly correct but lacked some details.
* Clarity: All models except Bing Chat expressed themselves clearly and were eas
y to understand.
* Conciseness: Bing Chat was the most concise, while Perplexity AI provided a very detailed explanation
 but was less concise.
* Helpfulness: Perplexity AI and Huggingface gave the most helpful responses that directly answer
ed the question. Bing Chat was the least helpful.

**Summary**:

Huggingface performed the best overall by providing an 
accurate, clear, reasonably concise, and very helpful response. It gave a detailed technical explanation while still bei
ng easy to understand.

* Perplexity AI also did very well, with an extremely accurate and helpful response, but was sli
ghtly less concise than ideal.
* Bard performed decently, giving a mostly correct response with good clarity, but lacked
 some important details.
* Bing Chat performed the worst - while concise, it had inaccuracies and lacked helpfulness.

S
o in conclusion, Huggingface demonstrated itself as the most capable model for providing knowledgeable, well-rounded exp
lanations to technical questions like this. Perplexity AI also did great, with room for improvement on conciseness. Bard
 was decent, while Bing Chat clearly lagged behind the others.

# Prompt: (Sourced from a Random Reddit Post)


    Can someone please clarify this to me: Are tools like LangChain interacting with the model (memory) directly, or it
's all just prompting behind the scenes and filtering the results to only include the complete answer ?
    Context: I'm
 playing with LLMs and I'm trying to understand the currently existing solutions for extending the model capabilities be
yond the prompt and current context.
    I can't find a clear answer, and I'm just trying to find out the basic flow of 
things.
    I know you can load embeddings with a model and it treats that as a part of it's model, but this does not ma
ke sense in case of dynamic data, like things fetched from vector db.
    Basically the actual question is: Can you feed
 dynamic data into the running model, at runtime, and directly in memory without prompting ?
    I know you CAN do promp
ting 'in the background', and parse it's outputs, but for a simple PC that does 5-6 t/s just with chat, doing additional
 inference will drop that resultant t/s way down below a usable level, so I'm looking for a best solution performance-wi
se here.

 done through the use of a memory class, which is a Python object that stores and manages the model's memory. The memory

>  
>`For example, the ConversationBufferMemory class in LangChain stores a list of chat messages in

```
I have a data set that isn't that large \~200 pdfs. I have done the regular RAG approach with Langchain, extracting text
, splitting into chunks, embedding with OpenAi embeddings and FAISS vector storage. However, when I do a similarity sear
ch with a question I would like answered it returns the wrong context. The documents are semi-structured information of 
examined bridges. A question I would like answered is f.e. 'what is the construction date of bridge X?'. When I input th
is question I get a lot of context of construction dates of other bridges. I think this is because the bridges are not e
xplicitly mentioned in the text. I tried adding the bridge name and document name to the page content string of the chun
ks, but this does nothing.

Does anyone have any tips on improving the embeddings retrieval in this case?

I am running text inferencing on Llama2-7b through langchain. I have downloaded the model from langchain's Huggingface l

Where can I make changes to speed up the transaction. Is there
 any change I can do in the model configuration to speed it up? Because if I use HuggingFaceHubAPI, it is able to give a

```
Hey [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/),

The team at TruEra recently released an open source
 project for evaluation & tracking of LLM applications called [TruLens-Eval](https://github.com/truera/trulens/tree/main
/trulens_eval). We’ve specifically targeted retrieval-augmented QA as a core use case and so far we’ve seen it used for 
comparing different models and parameters, prompts, vector-db configurations and query planning strategies. I’d love to 
get your feedback on it.

The core idea behind the project is feedback functions. Analogous to labeling functions, feedb
ack functions are models used to score the text produced by LLMs. We already have a variety of out-of-the-box feedback f
unctions to use for eval including relevance, language match, sentiment and moderation that can be applied to inputs, ou
tputs or intermediate steps of your application.

On top of eval, there’s also built-in tracking of cost and latency.

W
e made it easy to integrate with different setups using connectors for langchain, llama-index + an option to use it with
out a framework.

MachineLearning -  [ [P] langchain-lite alternative ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/14xf9xb/p_langchainlite_alternative/) , 1689140460.0
```
Although langchain is an impressive library, I tend to find it is…

* a little unintuitive, at least for non-trivial exa
mples or examples that don’t have a predefined chains/templates
* related, it's overly prescriptive; and the various lev
els of abstraction don't resonate with me
* related, can be difficult to debug or understand what’s happening in interme
diate steps of the chain or what’s it’s actually sending OpenAI

So, I built a “langchain-lite” package called `llm-work
flow`

https://github.com/shane-kercheval/llm-workflow

The value proposition is basically:

* easily build up a sequenc
e of tasks (e.g. prompt-template -> chat) called a workflow, where the output of one task serves as the input to the nex
t task in the workflow
* **track history**; understand what's happening in each of the tasks; **aggregate token usage, c
osts, etc. across the workflow**

So a workflow can be anything from `prompt -> chat -> response` to `prompt -> web-sear
ch -> web-scraping -> vector-database & retrieval -> modified prompt -> chat -> response`.

Here's an example of a 'prom
pt enhancer' workflow, where the user provides a prompt, one model enhances/improves the prompt, and the second model an
swers the question based on the enhanced prompt.

```python
prompt_enhancer = OpenAIChat(...)
chat_assistant = OpenAICha
t(...)

def prompt_template(user_prompt: str) -> str:
    return 'Improve the user's request, below, by expanding the re
quest ' \
        'to describe the relevant python best practices and documentation ' \
        f'requirements that shou
ld be followed:\n\n```{user_prompt}```'

def prompt_extract_code(_) -> str:
    # `_` signals that we are ignoring the i
nput (from the previous task)
    return 'Return only the primary code of interest from the previous answer, '\
        
'including docstrings, but without any text/response.'

workflow = Workflow(tasks=[
    prompt_template,      # modifies
 the user's prompt
    prompt_enhancer,      # returns an improved version of the user's prompt
    chat_assistant,     
  # returns the chat response based on the improved prompt
    prompt_extract_code,  # prompt to ask the model to extrac
t only the relevant code
    chat_assistant,       # returns only the relevant code from the model's last response
])
pr
ompt = 'create a function to mask all emails from a string value'
response = workflow(prompt)
```

The `response` is: `d
ef mask_email_addresses(string): .....`

We can view the history, which includes the prompts/responses/tokens/etc. for e
ach interaction:

```python
print(workflow.history())
```

Output:

```
[
    ExchangeRecord(prompt='Improve the user's 
request, below, by ...', response='Create a Python function that adheres to best practice...', timestamp='2023-07-12 04:
45:04.703', cost=0.00063, total_tokens=333, prompt_tokens=58, response_tokens=275),
    ExchangeRecord(prompt='Create a 
Python function that adheres ...', response='Sure! Here\'s an example of a Python function that adh...', timestamp='2023
-07-12 04:45:14.696', cost=0.00149, total_tokens=820,  prompt_tokens=292, response_tokens=528),

]
```

We can
 also summarize costs/tokens/etc.

```python
print(workflow.sum('cost'))             # 0.0034
print(workflow.sum('total_
tokens'))     # 1961
print(workflow.sum('prompt_tokens'))    # 1104
print(workflow.sum('response_tokens'))  # 857
```

MachineLearning -  [ [D] What have been your use cases for LLM autonomous agents? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/14w817y/d_what_have_been_your_use_cases_for_llm/) , 1689026848.0
```
I've been using GPT for completions on a daily basis for a while now - code completion and search-like chatting, basical
ly. I've recently been playing around with both ChatGPT plugins and LangChain for autonomous-agent-like behavior, and al
though the idea of the LLM interacting with the environment through API calls or code interpretation seems promising, in
 practice I haven't found such a useful and usable case for it like completions yet.

LangChain's OpenAPI toolkit with i
ts planner/controller agent duo seems to get lost 90% of the time, making it unusable. This happens even with an /api en
dpoint telling it exactly how to interact with the API and prompt templates suggesting that this endpoint be used to get
 the API specs. Maybe I'm just not getting it right...

As for ChatGPT plugins, other than web search for more updated r
esults I haven't really found a use case where I could not do the same thing with completions. Code Interpreter shaves o
ff a few seconds vs completions and running whatever script it produces locally, but it's not very useful in face of com
pliance or privacy requirements of not uploading stuff into OpenAI. For example I wanted to speed up a work related vide
o and add a separate audio track to it. I couldn't upload the video to OpenAI as it contained internal work stuff, so I 
just used completions for an ffmpeg script to do the job and ran it locally. Same thing with transforming or plotting CS
V data - can't really update customer data to OpenAI, so just get the script and run it locally.

Anyway, I can *think o
f* a lot of cool use cases for autonomous agents and the like, but I haven't been able to *actually use* it in my daily 
routine, unlike text completion. Have you been using autonomous agents successfully and regularly?

I learned that developing a 'ChatGPT for your documents' is e
asily achievable through three broad workflows combined with access to OpenAI API. In fact, I went ahead and prototyped 
such a system on streamlit. 

Step 1 - The Setup: Store your documents as embeddings.
In the first step, use Document Lo
aders (at least 100 are available), provided by LangChain to convert anything from a simple Word document to an AWS S3 d
irectory into Documents. Then, using Document Transformers and Text Embedding Models, you transform your documents into 
embeddings. Finally, store these embeddings in a vector store for searches later on. It's a one-time setup that sets the
 foundation for your Q&A system. 💡🛠️

Step 2 - Establish Context: Find relevant documents.
LangChain's Text Embedding mo
del converts user queries into vectors. These vectors are used by LangChain's retriever to search the vector store and r
etrieve the most relevant documents. You can control the search boundaries based on relevance scores or the desired numb
er of documents. It's all about finding the right context for your Q&A system. 🎯💬

Step 3 - Chat Away: Get answers from 
LLMs.
Now comes the fun part! You pass the user's query and the established context to the Language Models (LLMs). The L
LMs respond with precise answers, taking into account the provided context. It's like having a conversation with your do
cuments. 🤩🗨️


By building these three workflows, a service that acts like a Q&A for a restricted set of documents can b
e set up. Of course, this is just an overview of the approach and all the complex steps of app development will still re
main, I remain fascinated by how the good folks at LangChain have made things simpler. 

What do you think? Have you tri
ed LangChain to build something? Is there any other framework that is equally fascinating?
