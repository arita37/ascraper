NeurIPS 2023 paper reviews are visible on OpenReview.  See t
his [tweet](https://twitter.com/francoisfleuret/status/16864
64712534638592). I thought to create a discussion thread for
 us to discuss any issue/complain/celebration or anything el
se.

There is so much noise in the reviews every year. Some 
good work that the authors are proud of might get a low scor
e because of the noisy system, given that NeurIPS is growing
 so large these years. We should keep in mind that the work 
is still valuable no matter what the score is.

Is it worth the time to pour time and effort into NeurIPS's 
annual competitions? Winners got to present at NIPS workshop
s.

I'm currently pursuing a Master degree in CS now and hav
e to compete in one of them. I looked up past winners, all o
f them are from Top CS schools or Large Tech's research team
s. So I kind of figured how hard they are to compete.

But c
ould someone give me some general advices? I have talked to 
some of my friends pursuing phd but they are not familiar wi
th the NIPS competition track.

Any help is appreciated. Tha
nk you strangers!

[Research] Using official implementations vs highly popular unofficial , 1689661325.0

So for the past six months I have been working on a domain a
daptation research problem. I wanted to inspect/understand t
he inherent capability of SSL methods to extract domain inva
riant features. For this purpose I have been conducting diff
erent kinds of experiments.There is a very nice library call
ed [lightly](https://github.com/lightly-ai/lightly)  that co
ntains the implementations of all published SSL methods, Thi
s made things very easy for me in terms of writing code. I a
m not a PhD student or don't have significant research exper
ience. My guide/mentor is very interested in the work I'm do
ing and she aims to publish our work in somewhere like a Neu
rIPS, ICML or so.

Probably because of my lack of experience
, I am overlooking into things or I am genuinely concerned. 
I just don't want to make stupid coding or code related erro
rs and report wrong results.  I just want to know if its man
datory to use the official implementations of every method I
'm benchmarking.or example, SimCLR's official implementation
 is in Tensorflow and I am using PyTorch. Using official imp
lementation would introduce these kind of bottlenecks and sl
ow down my experimentation process. Any advices on this woul
d be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

[D] NeurIPS 2023 reviews release time? , 1689195099.0

Hey guys, I was wondering if y’all know when NeurIPS reviews
 for this year would be released? I know the response period
 starts on August 4, but do we get to see reviews before? Ar
e they all released at once, or gradually as reviewers finis
h them? Thanks!

[D] Come check out /r/LearningMachines, a subreddit focused on basic a , 1688833690.0

Hey, all. I just created a new subreddit, /r/LearningMachine
s. The goal of the subreddit is to be entirely research-focu
sed. With that being said, I'm hoping the research discussed
 in /r/LearningMachines will be broader than just papers sub
mitted to ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR/CVPR. With that being the case, 
the only rule for submissions is that they must be research 
involving machine learning. Here, 'research' means either an
 academic manuscript/technical report (e.g., posted on arXiv
, a journal website, or a conference website; note that this
 does not include Medium posts) *or* a conference presentati
on where conferences can be either academic or applied/indus
trial in nature (e.g., PyData). You're a biologist who used 
machine learning to classify species using their DNA? Share 
it! You're a data scientist who used graph neural networks t
o model customer interactions? Submit your conference talk! 
Links to project webpages/code repositories for papers are a
cceptable, but they must be clearly tied to a singular piece
 of research.

Note that software packages are *not* conside
red research by themselves in this context. If the software 
package has an associated research product (i.e., paper or c
onference presentation), then that research product should b
e the link for the submission.

Lastly, I also want to activ
ely encourage a culture of self-promotion. Reddit is the onl
y social network where reach is relatively flat, i.e., your 
research can be seen by a wide audience regardless of your s
eniority or institution, so this subreddit is an opportunity
 for junior scientists and/or researchers at less prominent 
institutions to share the cool things they're working on. In
 that spirit, I want to actively encourage every user to sub
mit all of their own research products from the past 12 mont
hs to the subreddit to get the community going.
