In my opinion, there’s no substitute for human evaluation, but using the GPT models to give us a starting point can be a huge advantage.

Conclusion
Labeling data is always difficult, and sometimes, even getting that starting point is a huge advantage. In this blog, we showed how you can use the GPT models by OpenAI to generate predictions for data to serve as the starting point for your data labeling workflows. This process can significantly reduce the amount of human effort involved, and focus labelers’ attention on providing more value for their efforts.
